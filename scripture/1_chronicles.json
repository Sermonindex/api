The Ark's stay at the house of Obed-Edom with blessing sparked hope in David that God can be pleased when he sought Him by revelation of Scripture.  The second parade that escorted the Ark to Jerusalem was by a transformed David dressed no longer as a king but a humble priest 'outside the camp'.",

The question is, \u201cWhat do we do with this cup of salvation\u201d? This message points to examples in history where people were given a great opportunity to serve God but became self indulgent. The self indulgent church has nothing in his heart for his brother. It gravitates to the things of the world and its possessions, instead of living for Christ. There is a final warning to the self indulgent church to turn away from their sins and become charitable to the poor. There is a time when a sentence is written against those who were supposed to be a testimony in the earth. Recognizing and honoring truth is not enough, we must embrace it and walk it out! In one minute everything can change and only those who have the compassion of God for humanity will stand!",

And they will reap wonderful rewards of joy and peace in their God. We need to actively seek God, wanting his ways and thoughts over our own to become so intimate with him that we know his heart and share it. Then we will love what he loves and hate what he hates. Thinking as he things, walking together in agreement. This is what God wants with each of his children. For those who want a closer walk with the Lord, this is a must hear.",

It is very important for the people of God to know the meaning of the times in which we live. God is always moving forward but He is having to bring His people back from where they have deviated from His intention and plan. Man never really learns anything theoretically. Man really learns anything only by experience. Everything in Christianity depends on the meaning of Jesus Christ. The main thing is a revelation of a Person inwardly. God reveals His Son \"in us\".",

This is where Peter, James and John where when Jesus invited them to go into Gethsemane, just a few hours before they had pledged to the Lord that they would not desert Him even though He Himself had told them they would scatter as sheep without a Shepherd.  The power of the Holy Spirit was not yet given and so Peter was moving in the flesh, he didn't see where the resources for maintaining a close walk with Jesus would come from.  But it is through Christ that all things are made possible to us, all the purposes God would have us to accomplish can be met as long as we realize our own weakness and abject need for Christ to live His life through us and that this can only be done by complete reliance on Him for the resources.",
