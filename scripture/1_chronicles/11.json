The question is, \u201cWhat do we do with this cup of salvation\u201d? This message points to examples in history where people were given a great opportunity to serve God but became self indulgent. The self indulgent church has nothing in his heart for his brother. It gravitates to the things of the world and its possessions, instead of living for Christ. There is a final warning to the self indulgent church to turn away from their sins and become charitable to the poor. There is a time when a sentence is written against those who were supposed to be a testimony in the earth. Recognizing and honoring truth is not enough, we must embrace it and walk it out! In one minute everything can change and only those who have the compassion of God for humanity will stand!",
