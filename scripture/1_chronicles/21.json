If we do not see within ourselves that which falls short of the glory of God we would be content with our lives the way they are and fail to demand the exchange that is rightfully ours. We must cry out to the Holy Spirit to uncover the corruption and then come to heavens exchange counter to give us what we need to walk in the abundant life.",
