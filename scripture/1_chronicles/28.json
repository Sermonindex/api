We can only faithfully represent him when we truly know him. If you are not actively, honestly seeking God, then you need to get down to business and ask him for the desire and hunger in your heart for him. He will give it to those who are sincere. And they will reap wonderful rewards of joy and peace in their God. We need to actively seek God, wanting his ways and thoughts over our own to become so intimate with him that we know his heart and share it. Then we will love what he loves and hate what he hates. Thinking as he things, walking together in agreement. This is what God wants with each of his children. For those who want a closer walk with the Lord, this is a must hear.",
