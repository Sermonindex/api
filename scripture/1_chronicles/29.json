Tozer fashions vivid imagery to dramatize how infinitely far above all is God, and issues a warning of profound importance: \u201cThe god of the average Evangelical church is too small! He\u2019s not the God of Heaven, and the God of Creation, but he\u2019s a homemade, handmade god you can pull down. He\u2019s a stuffed shirt; he\u2019s a Santa Claus; he\u2019s just an old uncle that we want to keep on his good side so that when the time comes he can make us rich\u2026\u201d 1 Chronicles 29:11 addresses the true JHVH: \u201cThine, O LORD is the greatness, and the power, and the glory, and the victory, and the majesty: for all that is in the heaven and in the earth is thine; thine is the kingdom, O LORD, and thou art exalted as head above all.\u201d The sermon was preached circa 1959, and is 39 minutes, 14 seconds in length.",
