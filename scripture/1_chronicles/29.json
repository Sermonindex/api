Smithers surveys the potential pitfalls that happen to Christians in each area and how to keep one's spiritual life on track in those essential things.",

Tozer fashions vivid imagery to dramatize how infinitely far above all is God, and issues a warning of profound importance: \u201cThe god of the average Evangelical church is too small! He\u2019s not the God of Heaven, and the God of Creation, but he\u2019s a homemade, handmade god you can pull down. He\u2019s a stuffed shirt; he\u2019s a Santa Claus; he\u2019s just an old uncle that we want to keep on his good side so that when the time comes he can make us rich\u2026\u201d 1 Chronicles 29:11 addresses the true JHVH: \u201cThine, O LORD is the greatness, and the power, and the glory, and the victory, and the majesty: for all that is in the heaven and in the earth is thine; thine is the kingdom, O LORD, and thou art exalted as head above all.\u201d The sermon was preached circa 1959, and is 39 minutes, 14 seconds in length.",
