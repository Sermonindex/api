            "description": "Roger Ellsworth speaks passionately about the desperate state of the Church. His sermon covers three aspects of the Isaiah scripture: A keen awareness of loss, A keen awareness of what produced the loss, A keen awareness that God could restore what was lost. True God sent revival is actual and possible in our days if we will humble ourselves as the people of God.",
