From chapter four of First Corinthians, verses one through five and fifteen through twenty-one, Dr. A. W. Tozer stresses the absolutely indispensable role that the Holy Spirit plays in convicting men of sin, in the teaching of the Gospel, and in the preaching of the Word. The pastor aptly declares, \u201cYou can\u2019t have power without the words, but you can have words without the power, and a lot of people do.\u201d",

Furthermore, Luke writes simply, with many stories of contrast and finally, he is the author that mentions the Holy Spirit the most and of how Jesus as man lived completely in the power of the Holy Spirit. Both parts of this introduction will certainly wet the appetite to study and drink in this unique gospel.",

This shows that the gospel is not something learned in five minutes, after which we go on to \u2018deeper things\u2019. The gospel of Jesus Christ is the deepest and greatest truth in all scripture \u2013 and we still won\u2019t understand its greatness after an eternity of eternities. People are not excited about the gospel these days, because they don\u2019t know it, and they don\u2019t understand the fullness of it. Mr Washer pulls no punches: \u201cIf Jesus Christ and his gospel do not excite you, you are going to hell\u201d, he pleads, before going on to explain what he means. He argues the great need for preachers of the true gospel, and explains what it means to receive the gospel, and how we may know that we have received it. What is your motivation for coming to Jesus Christ? Security? Healing? A new Mercedes? Or do you come for salvation? But what about coming to Christ simply because he is worthy? That alone ought to be motivation enough to repent and believe. This potent and searching message ends with a sober warning of the perils of ignoring this gospel. (50 minutes)",

In this case we are encouraging a chronological reading of the Scriptures. Most of the confusion is created when certain teachers, groups, or denominations take singular verses out of context and compare them with others. Though it is a good spiritual principle to compare spiritual truths with spiritual truths,1139 yet this must all be done in the larger context of God\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Word.

Jackie Pullinger speaks about the spiritual realities she has experienced in her ministry in Hong Kong among drug addicts, prostitutes & criminals and backs those up by Scripture. She makes clear that the Holy Spirit lives in every true Christian from his or her new birth on. This inner work of the Holy Spirit grows character and fruit in the believer. Jackie goes on to describe an additional and complementary gift. It is often called the outpouring of the Holy Spirit or the baptism of the Holy Spirit. This experience is accompanied by the evidence of a personal prayer language (speaking in tongues). The outpouring of the Holy Spirit equips the believer with power to share Jesus with the lost. Jackie emphasizes again that we must share spiritual truth with spiritual words (1 Corinthians 2:13). The message starts with several wonderful testimonies of how God revealed Himself to the lost in the Wall City and how drug addicts came off drugs with no medication and no withdrawal symptoms.",

While any believer can be used by God anytime to operate in any of the nine spiritual gifts, he or she does not \"own\" any of them.

Secondly, Christians can testify of times of prayer when the presence and power of God fill the heart almost to bursting; it is not so with the Jehovah\u2019s Witness, for God is not with them. Thirdly, check whether the Jehovah\u2019s Witness\u2019 \u201cgospel\u201d conforms to the Gospel that the Apostle Paul preached, using the above scriptures.",

            "description": "Throughout this beautiful and anointed message, Jackie shares many wonderful testimonies of the work of the Holy Spirit saving, healing and delivering drug addicts, prostitutes and criminals in the Wall City in Hong Kong. She speaks about the revival in China, and how teenage girls leave their homes and walk from village to village sharing Jesus. They come back two years later and multitudes have accepted Christ. These girls have never been to a seminar or a worship service. They simply give everything they have away. Jackie also witnesses about brothers and sisters coming out of decades in prison with broken bodies many times, but rejoicing and shining in their Saviour. She emphasizes that the revival in China is not facilitated by visual aids, life changing tapes, videos of the month or Christian magazines. It comes through the Holy Spirit using \"just a few people who aren't very educated, without microphones, who loved their lives not unto death - that's it.\" In this way, God has chosen the foolish things of the world to shame the wise (1 Corinthians 1:26-27). Jesus came to preach the good news to the poor (Luke 4:18). Jackie explains how the poor are often able to hear the gospel much quicker than an educated person, because they can hear spiritually. This is why the poor in spirit are blessed (Matthew 5:3). Jackie Pullinger emphasizes that men and women are saved through the Spirit of God, not through man's reasoning. She concludes with a call to die and a profound challenge: \"His glory will fall if you go out with nothing except a broken heart and some precious seed, and I suppose we have all got that.\"",

The Cross is the power of God in Christ to overpower all the forces of darkness. Because of the Cross the impossible becomes possible. So how do we embrace the power of the Cross? The answer is simple. You can stare at the Cross in unbelief or you can put out your hand by faith and take the victory. We cannot have sin in our life and have the power of the Cross. You have to choose to walk out of sin and walk into the power of God!",

Jesus will come and burn in us with a fiery jealousy; He will consume everything that is not like Him. This fire is an inner passion born of the life of Christ within us. It\u2019s a fire that is always gathering and burning that which does not conform to the image of Christ within us. Jesus will try our works everyday by fire constantly changing and challenging and taking those things that are unlike Him and burning them in the fire of His passionate love for us.",

From chapter four of First Corinthians, verses one through five and fifteen through twenty-one, Dr. A. W. Tozer stresses the absolutely indispensable role that the Holy Spirit plays in convicting men of sin, in the teaching of the Gospel, and in the preaching of the Word. The pastor aptly declares, \u201cYou can\u2019t have power without the words, but you can have words without the power, and a lot of people do.\u201d",

Jesus Christ went through everything you are going through and His voice is the only voice that counts. God will never allow your enemies to triumph over you. Sometimes it is as simple as hearing a Word from God. There is a point when God quiets every voice and calls you to be silent before Him so He can calm the storm.

God didn\u2019t choose us because we were strong and wise. He chose the foolish and weak things to confound the wise. God doesn\u2019t need anything to make something. He is a God who makes something out of nothing. God needs nothing to work with. Too many in the church today are not willing to admit that we are nothing, and so we are hindering God from working in us and through us. If you know you are nothing and you understand your need for God, this preaching is for Good for Nothing (you)!",

SPURGEON, AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON, ON LORD'S-DAY EVENING, APRIL 26TH, 1874. \u201cBy the grace of God I am what I am.\u201d \u2014 1 Corinthians 15:10. IF you will read the context of this passage, you will find that these words occur in one of Paul's digressions, or parentheses. He was a writer who very frequently went off at a tangent; he often left the subject on which he was writing, turned his thoughts in quite another direction, and then came back, and went on with the subject which he had left for a while. In this respect, I have; often, in my own mind, likened the apostle Paul to Samson. When he was on the road to Timnath with his father and mother he turned aside to slay the lion, and afterwards to find the honey in the carcass, and each time he came back to his parents just as if nothing had happened. So the apostle Paul often turns aside from some grand argument upon which he is engaged, and says something very valuable and important upon quite another topic, and then comes back again, and calmly and deliberately goes on with his argument.",

It was the first of at least two messages that Pastor A. W. Tozer preached on this date, the other being \u201cThe New Year As God Sees It,\u201d which he delivered shortly before midnight. In the morning message, he focuses on 1 Corinthians 16:13-14, and upon the critical importance of staying watchful. A sure way to let one\u2019s guard down is to believe that the Devil does not exist. The pastor goes on to contemplate masculine and feminine virtues, and reads from what he considers to be the most disturbing chapter of the Bible, 1 Corinthians 13:1-7. He concludes with three things that will make us strong: 1) the Spirit\u2019s infilling; 2) the Lord\u2019s indwelling; 3) prayer and the Scriptures. The length of the sermon is 42 minutes and 15 seconds.",

Then he left to continue his journey, travelling the world and planting churches. He didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t forget those who were left behind. He kept writing letters to them. He always remembered them in prayer, urging them to continue in the Lord\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s work. He desired that each one would go forward to achieve the goal. Sometimes he disciplined them and sometimes he strengthened and comforted them.",

There is nothing worse than sin in a Christian's life that will cause him to fail. Jesus calls you to live on the mountain top. As a Christian you must live in victory over sin, the world and the devil, by God's power. If you don't, you will become like salt which has lost its saltiness. Young people who fall into sin excuse themselves that the attraction for the opposite sex is just too strong. No, in the Name of the Lord Jesus Christ, if anyone fixes their eyes on the Lord Jesus Christ, such a person will overcome and be successful. Wherever you go, if you fix your eyes on the goal, your life won't be worthless. A Christian is not allowed to sin, whether it be a small or a big sin in your own eyes.",

The central core of Christ is that He came to the world not to do His own will but to do the will of the Father. The will of the Father is that none would perish. The cry of your heart in these last days should be LORD BREAK ME!",

            "description": "A deeply moving wake-up call to the church, instructing her to live in the light of eternity, \"for we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ\" (2 Corinthians 5:10). Leonard Ravenhill describes the judgment day from Scripture as a court day  where the verdict is final. He first points to the judgment of the unjust and then focusses on the judgment of the righteous. He emphasizes that we will all stand before Jesus alone and will not only be judged for what we have done, but also for what we have not done that we should have done. He denounces the worldliness of the people of God who invest their time and money as the world does - thus building on wood, hay and stubble as opposed to silver, gold and precious stones. Leonard Ravenhill strongly opposes today's \"sloppy gospel\" and \"sloppy evangelism\"  of a love with no judgment. He warns that we are passing from the mercy of the lamb to the wrath of the lamb when Jesus judges the earth and mercy will be gone forever. As the work of every human being shall be tried in the fire, many public ministries will go down in ashes. Leonard describes 95 % of believers as bound by superstition and theology. He criticizes the unjust money-making of public ministries that leads to false investments of large amounts of money. He states that we must have Jesus take the government over our lives in reality and be lost and consumed in Him. Ravenhill closes his sermon with a strong call to repentance: \"If we cannot live as a different breed of people on this earth we have no right to live here. God stamp eternity on my eyeballs.\"",

            "description": "A deeply moving wake-up call to the church, instructing her to live in the light of eternity, \"for we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ\" (2 Corinthians 5:10). Leonard Ravenhill describes the judgment day from Scripture as a court day  where the verdict is final. He first points to the judgment of the unjust and then focusses on the judgment of the righteous. He emphasizes that we will all stand before Jesus alone and will not only be judged for what we have done, but also for what we have not done that we should have done. He denounces the worldliness of the people of God who invest their time and money as the world does - thus building on wood, hay and stubble as opposed to silver, gold and precious stones. Leonard Ravenhill strongly opposes today's \"sloppy gospel\" and \"sloppy evangelism\"  of a love with no judgment. He warns that we are passing from the mercy of the lamb to the wrath of the lamb when Jesus judges the earth and mercy will be gone forever. As the work of every human being shall be tried in the fire, many public ministries will go down in ashes. Leonard describes 95 % of believers as bound by superstition and theology. He criticizes the unjust money-making of public ministries that leads to false investments of large amounts of money. He states that we must have Jesus take the government over our lives in reality and be lost and consumed in Him. Ravenhill closes his sermon with a strong call to repentance: \"If we cannot live as a different breed of people on this earth we have no right to live here. God stamp eternity on my eyeballs.\"",

            "description": "December 13, 2009 - God chooses an incredible strategy to release His provision. God will feed His people and then use the people He feeds to feed others. Before God can use us and pour His provision through us He must see a core value in our character. We must have the same compassion that Christ has for us. True compassion is born of the Spirit. The storehouse of God is unlocked when the Holy Spirit stirs us to reach out to the sea of human need all around us.",

The word 'castaway' is supposed to be taken from workers of metals; you know there is a part of the metal which comes out of the furnace which is called dross, which is of no manner of use and is cast away. The same word is sometimes translated 'reprobate'. Those of you in this congregation who will be cast away will be found to be but dross, 'reprobate silver shall men call them' (Jeremiah 6:30).",

These are people who willingly offer themselves entirely to the Lord and expect nothing back but His presence. God dwells with ordinary people who concern themselves with the depth of the need and give all they have for the cause of Christ. The Tabernacle of David is a people who posses the heart of God and then take His heart to a fallen humanity.",

The natural man sees things as unattainable because they are out of his control and he is not willing to let go of the reigns of his life. The spiritual man knows that in and of himself he has no strength but as he gives the reigns of his life over to the Holy Spirit he will step into the supernatural.

            "description": "According to Dr. Tozer, Christians have a tendency to hold fast to one truth at the expense of another. Then, after a time, someone comes along and preaches the forgotten Truth -- as Martin Luther did with the doctrine of justification by faith. He was first considered a heretic for peaching an unfamiliar (actually, forgotten) doctrine, but it marked the beginning of the reformation of the church. Has justification by faith now overshadowed other truths, like the inevitability of God's judgment? Dr. Tozer explores this possibility and reaches some disturbing conclusions.",

Paul was a man wholely devoted to Christ and His gospel even to the point where he would refuse to be supported by the christians around him so that none could say that he preached the gospel for any other reason than to glory Christ his Lord.  He was a man who chose to become 'all things to all men that he might win some' enslaving himself so that he could reach more and more diverse peoples than anyone else at the time. A man who was utterly consumed by the necessity to preach the gospel.\r\n\r\n[i]All material by Pastor Legge is copyrighted.

If you will read this chapter of Paul's epistle, so justly celebrated as a master-piece of language you will find him speaking of that which is to come after death with such exaltation and glory, that you feel, \u201cIf this be to die, then it were well to depart at once.\u201d Who has not rejoiced, and whose heart has not been lifted up, or filled with a holy fire, while he has read such sentences as these: \u201cIn a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trump: for the trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall be raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed.

We must even be united in our thoughts, and in what we hate. If there is no hatred in your life towards sin and abhorrence for the world, you are rotten and good for nothing in God's Kingdom.

The heart of Christ is to minister to and serve others, and he wants us to share his heart. The devil is trying to destroy the Body, going after the weak and the young. We are to watch for our brothers and sisters, and if we see them in a battle, we must be willing to fight for them. To go into the secret closet and war against this thing on their behalf, to love not just in word, but in deed. Selfishness has disastrous consequences. Take heed.",

Preaching in Denmark, he opens with a plea for men who have a zeal for the Lord\u2019s house, who will stand up and be counted, and will seize the opportunities for preaching the gospel while they exist. Moving on to Chapter 1 of Mark\u2019s gospel, he shows how demanding life can be for the zealous man of God, as exemplified in the ministry of Jesus Christ himself. If the Son of God could not live on earth without prayer and secret communion with his Father, how much less can we. He was never too busy to pray; nor should we be. Everything we are in public, is formed by what we are in private when we are alone with God, says Mr Washer; and he then goes on to use the Luke 18 passage to expound the topic of persevering prayer, showing both how and why we should endure in prayer, how God delights in it, and what it can achieve.

God will leave these trials in our life to train our hands for war and to cause us to depend on the power of the Holy Spirit. We need to understand our enemies are already defeated but we still need to go to Jesus to get the resources and to stand in faith.

            "description": "May 17, 2009 - Salvation is not just forgiveness, it\u2019s a way out of sin. Undealt with sin turns life into death and turns our life into something so much other than what God planned for us. Sin knows no boundaries and drives us farther and harder than where we want to go. How do we turn from sin? We turn from sin when we return to Christ and allow a living loving God to envelope us and break the power of sin in our lives. In Christ the deepest longings of our heart are satisfied. God is calling you to come home to Him!",

The almighty sovereign God has given us the gift of our own will, but God is a God of relationship. He wants us, out of our own will and choice, to hand over the keys of our will to Him! He's waiting! What will you do with the keys of your will?",

But the danger of causing another to fall in his right to excercise his liberty, he would rather not, if it would make one fall. Even though he had a right to expect to be supported financially by the church as a minister, he chose to work to support himself, by working with his own hands, driven to preach the gospel, but did not expect reward from anyone other than God. Paul said he was compelled to preach the Gospel. Something is wrong with believers by the multitudes who feel compelled to do nothing for Christ. We as believers need to know what the Lord placed us in the Body of Christ to do. A gripping message!",
