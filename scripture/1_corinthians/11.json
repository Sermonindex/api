The body of Christ is not self consumed or self indulgent, but rather vessels that are fully given over to the government of the Holy Spirit",

We are to reflect a new value system which is the giving of ourselves in the same way that Christ gave for us. The central core of Christ is that He came to the world not to do His own will but to do the will of the Father. The will of the Father is that none would perish. The cry of your heart in these last days should be LORD BREAK ME!",

The heart of Christ is to minister to and serve others, and he wants us to share his heart. The devil is trying to destroy the Body, going after the weak and the young. We are to watch for our brothers and sisters, and if we see them in a battle, we must be willing to fight for them. To go into the secret closet and war against this thing on their behalf, to love not just in word, but in deed. Selfishness has disastrous consequences. Take heed.",
