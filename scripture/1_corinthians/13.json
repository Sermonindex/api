When one of the members suffers, the others have compassion on that person as if they are suffering themselves. We must be one in the things of the Lord; one in humility, accepting God's Word and applying it to our lives and obey it. We cannot claim to be of one heart when there is division and each one pulls his or her own way. If we are not united then there is something wrong in our midst. We must even be united in our thoughts, and in what we hate. If there is no hatred in your life towards sin and abhorrence for the world, you are rotten and good for nothing in God's Kingdom. You must hate the world and the things of the world \u2013 the lust of the eyes, the lust of the flesh and the pride and haughtiness of life.",
