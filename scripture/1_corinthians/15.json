It has also been referred to as the \"happiest gospel\", for there is much on joy and thanksgiving. Furthermore, Luke writes simply, with many stories of contrast and finally, he is the author that mentions the Holy Spirit the most and of how Jesus as man lived completely in the power of the Holy Spirit. Both parts of this introduction will certainly wet the appetite to study and drink in this unique gospel.",

This shows that the gospel is not something learned in five minutes, after which we go on to \u2018deeper things\u2019. The gospel of Jesus Christ is the deepest and greatest truth in all scripture \u2013 and we still won\u2019t understand its greatness after an eternity of eternities. People are not excited about the gospel these days, because they don\u2019t know it, and they don\u2019t understand the fullness of it. Mr Washer pulls no punches: \u201cIf Jesus Christ and his gospel do not excite you, you are going to hell\u201d, he pleads, before going on to explain what he means. He argues the great need for preachers of the true gospel, and explains what it means to receive the gospel, and how we may know that we have received it. What is your motivation for coming to Jesus Christ? Security? Healing? A new Mercedes? Or do you come for salvation? But what about coming to Christ simply because he is worthy? That alone ought to be motivation enough to repent and believe. This potent and searching message ends with a sober warning of the perils of ignoring this gospel. (50 minutes)",

IF you will read the context of this passage, you will find that these words occur in one of Paul's digressions, or parentheses. He was a writer who very frequently went off at a tangent; he often left the subject on which he was writing, turned his thoughts in quite another direction, and then came back, and went on with the subject which he had left for a while. In this respect, I have; often, in my own mind, likened the apostle Paul to Samson. When he was on the road to Timnath with his father and mother he turned aside to slay the lion, and afterwards to find the honey in the carcass, and each time he came back to his parents just as if nothing had happened. So the apostle Paul often turns aside from some grand argument upon which he is engaged, and says something very valuable and important upon quite another topic, and then comes back again, and calmly and deliberately goes on with his argument.",
