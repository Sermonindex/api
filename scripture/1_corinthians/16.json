It was the first of at least two messages that Pastor A. W. Tozer preached on this date, the other being \u201cThe New Year As God Sees It,\u201d which he delivered shortly before midnight. In the morning message, he focuses on 1 Corinthians 16:13-14, and upon the critical importance of staying watchful. A sure way to let one\u2019s guard down is to believe that the Devil does not exist. The pastor goes on to contemplate masculine and feminine virtues, and reads from what he considers to be the most disturbing chapter of the Bible, 1 Corinthians 13:1-7. He concludes with three things that will make us strong: 1) the Spirit\u2019s infilling; 2) the Lord\u2019s indwelling; 3) prayer and the Scriptures. The length of the sermon is 42 minutes and 15 seconds.",

Tozer and spoke of him as one of the most influential voices in the Church in America. A.W.

Preaching in Denmark, he opens with a plea for men who have a zeal for the Lord\u2019s house, who will stand up and be counted, and will seize the opportunities for preaching the gospel while they exist. Moving on to Chapter 1 of Mark\u2019s gospel, he shows how demanding life can be for the zealous man of God, as exemplified in the ministry of Jesus Christ himself. If the Son of God could not live on earth without prayer and secret communion with his Father, how much less can we. He was never too busy to pray; nor should we be. Everything we are in public, is formed by what we are in private when we are alone with God, says Mr Washer; and he then goes on to use the Luke 18 passage to expound the topic of persevering prayer, showing both how and why we should endure in prayer, how God delights in it, and what it can achieve.
