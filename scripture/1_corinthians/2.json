In this case we are encouraging a chronological reading of the Scriptures. Most of the confusion is created when certain teachers, groups, or denominations take singular verses out of context and compare them with others. Though it is a good spiritual principle to compare spiritual truths with spiritual truths,1139 yet this must all be done in the larger context of God\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Word. Therefore we are encouraging all of God\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s saints to have a consistent discipline of reading through the whole Scriptures once a year as a supplemental reading plan.",

            "description": "An excellent teaching on the work of the Holy Spirit. Jackie Pullinger speaks about the spiritual realities she has experienced in her ministry in Hong Kong among drug addicts, prostitutes & criminals and backs those up by Scripture. She makes clear that the Holy Spirit lives in every true Christian from his or her new birth on. This inner work of the Holy Spirit grows character and fruit in the believer. Jackie goes on to describe an additional and complementary gift. It is often called the outpouring of the Holy Spirit or the baptism of the Holy Spirit. This experience is accompanied by the evidence of a personal prayer language (speaking in tongues). The outpouring of the Holy Spirit equips the believer with power to share Jesus with the lost. Jackie emphasizes again that we must share spiritual truth with spiritual words (1 Corinthians 2:13). The message starts with several wonderful testimonies of how God revealed Himself to the lost in the Wall City and how drug addicts came off drugs with no medication and no withdrawal symptoms.",

He offers a balanced view on how to determine what soulishness is, and says that we must learn to allow the sword of the spirit to divide that which is of the soul from that which is of the Spirit, in order that we may fly out of this snare.",

He is a God who makes something out of nothing. God needs nothing to work with. Too many in the church today are not willing to admit that we are nothing, and so we are hindering God from working in us and through us. If you know you are nothing and you understand your need for God, this preaching is for Good for Nothing (you)!",

It then progresses through the history of heresy and apostasy in the Church -- ranging from Platonic dualism, Manicheanism, Augustine's doctrines of original sin and infant baptism, etc. A quote from the message says it all: \"We had a Protestant Reformation, and oh, it did everything but reform! It was good, but it didn't go far enough -- it didn't reform.\"",
