Jackie Pullinger speaks about the spiritual realities she has experienced in her ministry in Hong Kong among drug addicts, prostitutes & criminals and backs those up by Scripture. She makes clear that the Holy Spirit lives in every true Christian from his or her new birth on. This inner work of the Holy Spirit grows character and fruit in the believer. Jackie goes on to describe an additional and complementary gift. It is often called the outpouring of the Holy Spirit or the baptism of the Holy Spirit. This experience is accompanied by the evidence of a personal prayer language (speaking in tongues). The outpouring of the Holy Spirit equips the believer with power to share Jesus with the lost. Jackie emphasizes again that we must share spiritual truth with spiritual words (1 Corinthians 2:13). The message starts with several wonderful testimonies of how God revealed Himself to the lost in the Wall City and how drug addicts came off drugs with no medication and no withdrawal symptoms.",

            "description": "Beginning with an explanation that soulishness is a topic many may not understand until later in their Christian walk, this sermon explains the dynamic of allowing biblical truth to hit the bedrock of the Christian\u2019s will as opposed to the sandier extremes of dry intellect or meaningless emotionalism.   He offers a balanced view on how to determine what soulishness is, and says that we must learn to allow the sword of the spirit to divide that which is of the soul from that which is of the Spirit, in order that we may fly out of this snare.",

The natural man sees things as unattainable because they are out of his control and he is not willing to let go of the reigns of his life. The spiritual man knows that in and of himself he has no strength but as he gives the reigns of his life over to the Holy Spirit he will step into the supernatural.
