            "description": "According to Dr. Tozer, Christians have a tendency to hold fast to one truth at the expense of another. Then, after a time, someone comes along and preaches the forgotten Truth -- as Martin Luther did with the doctrine of justification by faith. He was first considered a heretic for peaching an unfamiliar (actually, forgotten) doctrine, but it marked the beginning of the reformation of the church. Has justification by faith now overshadowed other truths, like the inevitability of God's judgment? Dr. Tozer explores this possibility and reaches some disturbing conclusions.",

He was involved in the missionary alliance movement for most of his pulpit life. A.W. Tozer lived in the presence of God he saw clearly and he spoke as a prophet to the church. He sought for God's honor with the zeal of Elijah and mourned with Jeremiah at the apostasy of God's people. \r\n\r\nLeonard Ravenhill was a close friend of pastor and writer A. W. Tozer and spoke of him as one of the most influential voices in the Church in America. A.W. Tozer's materials are a mainstay in Evangelical churches in our day and he is one of the most quoted authors. He was a prophet in his day and his writings are even more influential in our day.
