            "description": "May 17, 2009 - Salvation is not just forgiveness, it\u2019s a way out of sin. Undealt with sin turns life into death and turns our life into something so much other than what God planned for us. Sin knows no boundaries and drives us farther and harder than where we want to go. How do we turn from sin? We turn from sin when we return to Christ and allow a living loving God to envelope us and break the power of sin in our lives. In Christ the deepest longings of our heart are satisfied. God is calling you to come home to Him!",

Bill Mcleod was the pastor of Ebenezer Baptist Church for many years where ultimately God sent revival to that affecting much of Canada. He had a passion to know God and His word. Paul Washer said he was one of the most godly men he met in Canada.\r\n\r\nBill Mcleod had been praying and had his congregation praying for revival for years. On, October 17, 1971, God in His sovereignty came in revival. Without human means or explanation, the revival spread from church to church, community to community, city to city, and not long after from province to province. This has become known as the 1971 Canadian Revival movement.",
