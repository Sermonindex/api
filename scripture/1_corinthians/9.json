He was born in Newtownards, County Down, Ireland in 1911. In his book Tramp after God, he tells of living for more than three years as a tramp abusing alcohol and involved in crime. Willie Mullan had a religious conversion and from that time forward he decided he would strive to serve God.\r\n\r\n In 1953 Willie Mullan was called to Lurgan Baptist church, and in August of that year he commenced the work in Lurgan. One of his great accomplishments during this time was the Tuesday night Bible class. Every Tuesday night hundreds attended to hear the exposition of the Word. In 1957 William Hewitt and a team of helpers commenced the tape recordings of the Bible class. At least 1500 of these recordings remain until this day.",

As a Christian you must live in victory over sin, the world and the devil, by God's power. If you don't, you will become like salt which has lost its saltiness. Young people who fall into sin excuse themselves that the attraction for the opposite sex is just too strong. No, in the Name of the Lord Jesus Christ, if anyone fixes their eyes on the Lord Jesus Christ, such a person will overcome and be successful. Wherever you go, if you fix your eyes on the goal, your life won't be worthless. A Christian is not allowed to sin, whether it be a small or a big sin in your own eyes.",

The same word is sometimes translated 'reprobate'. Those of you in this congregation who will be cast away will be found to be but dross, 'reprobate silver shall men call them' (Jeremiah 6:30).",

Scottish divine, youngest son of Adam McCheyne, writer to the signet, was born in Edinburgh, 21 May 1813. At the age of four he knew the characters of the Greek alphabet, and was able to sing and recite fluently. He entered the high school in his eighth year, and matriculated in November 1827 at Edinburgh University, where he showed very versatile powers, and distinguished himself especially in poetical exercises, being awarded a special prize by Professor Wilson for a poem on 'The Covenanters.' In the winter of 1831 he commenced his studies in the Divinity Hall, under Dr. Chalmers and Dr. Welsh; and he was licensed as a preacher by the Annan presbytery on 1 July 1835.\r\n\r\nMcCheyne devoted all his energies to preaching; and although he was an accomplished Hebrew scholar, he left few permanent proofs of his erudition. He had refined musical taste, and was one of the first of the Scottish ministers to take an active part in the improvement of the congregational service of praise. Long after his death he was constantly referred to as 'the saintly McCheyne.'",

            "description": "In this sermon Pastor Legge shows how Paul was a master soul winnner, and illustrates the methods he used.  Paul was a man wholely devoted to Christ and His gospel even to the point where he would refuse to be supported by the christians around him so that none could say that he preached the gospel for any other reason than to glory Christ his Lord.  He was a man who chose to become 'all things to all men that he might win some' enslaving himself so that he could reach more and more diverse peoples than anyone else at the time. A man who was utterly consumed by the necessity to preach the gospel.\r\n\r\n[i]All material by Pastor Legge is copyrighted.

They settle for less than God intended for them. I have to say that there can even be resentment, or resistance, shown toward anyone who will try to get God's people over the Jordan and into their inheritance.\" - David Legge",

But the danger of causing another to fall in his right to excercise his liberty, he would rather not, if it would make one fall. Even though he had a right to expect to be supported financially by the church as a minister, he chose to work to support himself, by working with his own hands, driven to preach the gospel, but did not expect reward from anyone other than God. Paul said he was compelled to preach the Gospel. Something is wrong with believers by the multitudes who feel compelled to do nothing for Christ. We as believers need to know what the Lord placed us in the Body of Christ to do. A gripping message!",
