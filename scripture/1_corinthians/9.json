He always remembered them in prayer, urging them to continue in the Lord\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s work. He desired that each one would go forward to achieve the goal. Sometimes he disciplined them and sometimes he strengthened and comforted them.",

There is nothing worse than sin in a Christian's life that will cause him to fail. Jesus calls you to live on the mountain top. As a Christian you must live in victory over sin, the world and the devil, by God's power. If you don't, you will become like salt which has lost its saltiness. Young people who fall into sin excuse themselves that the attraction for the opposite sex is just too strong. No, in the Name of the Lord Jesus Christ, if anyone fixes their eyes on the Lord Jesus Christ, such a person will overcome and be successful. Wherever you go, if you fix your eyes on the goal, your life won't be worthless. A Christian is not allowed to sin, whether it be a small or a big sin in your own eyes.",

The word 'castaway' is supposed to be taken from workers of metals; you know there is a part of the metal which comes out of the furnace which is called dross, which is of no manner of use and is cast away. The same word is sometimes translated 'reprobate'. Those of you in this congregation who will be cast away will be found to be but dross, 'reprobate silver shall men call them' (Jeremiah 6:30).",

Paul was a man wholely devoted to Christ and His gospel even to the point where he would refuse to be supported by the christians around him so that none could say that he preached the gospel for any other reason than to glory Christ his Lord.  He was a man who chose to become 'all things to all men that he might win some' enslaving himself so that he could reach more and more diverse peoples than anyone else at the time. A man who was utterly consumed by the necessity to preach the gospel.\r\n\r\n[i]All material by Pastor Legge is copyrighted.

But the danger of causing another to fall in his right to excercise his liberty, he would rather not, if it would make one fall. Even though he had a right to expect to be supported financially by the church as a minister, he chose to work to support himself, by working with his own hands, driven to preach the gospel, but did not expect reward from anyone other than God. Paul said he was compelled to preach the Gospel. Something is wrong with believers by the multitudes who feel compelled to do nothing for Christ. We as believers need to know what the Lord placed us in the Body of Christ to do. A gripping message!",
