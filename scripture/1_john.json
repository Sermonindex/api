In this wonderful sermon, Spurgeon enlarges upon the \"love that God hath to us,\" which we have \"known and believed.\" He discourses here on \"knowing\" God's love for you, and \"believing\" in it, a two-fold experience. On knowing God's love for us, Spurgeon says that through seeing it in our lives, feeling it through the intimacy of Christ, and lastly through the witness of the Spirit do we come to know it. Then, there are seasons when \"all strength and hope are gone,\" and we \"behold nothing but the uttermost depths of despair.\" Now this person may not know God's love for him, but he can still believe in it. \"To believe it when you do not feel it, is the noblest,\" Spurgeon says. Then he expands on how God's love to us is undeserved, for there \"was nothing in us that could have caused it,\" there was never \"anything in us by nature that he could love.\" Oh, What an amazing thought to ponder on! Furthermore he says, \"the love of God towards us is free, sovereign, undeserved, and springs entirely from the overflowing love of his own heart, and is not caused by anything in us.\"",

As a young man he became aware that the Lord was calling him into the work of the ministry. At timely stages the Lord placed folk in his path who were able to direct him into the truth of heart purity and a more expansive understanding of the ministry of the Holy Spirit. He held pastorates in Kent and Bradford. By the late 1960s, following a significant period of ministry in Liverpool, he began a more itinerant ministry. This led him to many parts of the world, and occupied him until well into his eighties. His powerful preaching and the unique sense of the Lord's presence, which seemed to brood over his meetings, were always intensely challenging.\r\nThe true secret of his remarkable ministry stemmed from his personal communion with the Lord Jesus. To him, 'entering the holiest' was not merely a theological concept; it was a distinct spiritual reality - and the central feature of his spiritual life. It was here, in the place of worship, that his revelatory ministry found its source. He preached from understanding and conviction. He was never the echo of another, nor did he take on board the ebb and flow of various contemporary emphases. He was not a man of 'books'; he soaked himself in Scripture and allowed it to saturate his heart and mind. Truly, this is a man who has lifted up a standard for the people. Mr North went to be with the Lord on 29th April 2003, shortly after his ninetieth birthday.",

Faith not only requires that something is held true, but that Someone has entered into your life. Grasp this secret or you've missed the crux of the matter. Faith is not believing a set of historical facts. All the historical facts about Jesus, that He was the perfect spotless Lamb of God, born of a virgin, died for our sins, was buried and rose again the third day - all of this the demons know to be true, but it doesn't help them. You need a special agreement with Jesus Christ, and then confess that commitment before people publicly.

Campbell seriously challenges those who would see revival (not just dream about it) to be unsparingly honest about themselves.",

            "description": "Revival is Christ is the central message of Denny Kenaston's sermon, \"Revival According to John,\" delivered October 23, 2008 at the Atlanta Revival Conference.  After hearing Paul Washer's \"Ten Indictments,\" I wondered what God would have me do, and Denny delivered God's suggestions, taken from the apostle John's first letter.  In a dynamic, interesting, and thought-provoking manner, Denny defines revival, and illustrates how revival should be our normal experience.  \"Ten Indictments\" and \"Revival According to John\" are two very powerful words needed in our church today, and as the apostle Paul and the early church father James stand back to back and look at both sides of faith and works, Paul Washer and Denny Kenaston give us a divinely-balanced approach to understanding the revival and reformation God desires in His people today.",

Was a Christian missionary, teacher, writer, and advocate of economic development in impoverished nations. A spiritual crisis during this period\u2014as he described two decades later in what is probably his best-known recorded teaching, \"Ten Shekels and a Shirt\"--left Reidhead with the conviction that much of evangelicalism had adopted utilitarian and humanistic philosophies contradictory to Biblical teaching. The end of all being, he came to believe, was not the happiness of man, but the glorification of God. This theme would recur throughout his later teaching.\r\n\r\nSince Mr. Reidhead's death in 1992, Bible Teaching Ministries, Inc. continues under the leadership of his wife, Marjorie, and daughter, Virginia Teitt, a dedicated Board, and the many people who have donated time and talent after being changed by God\u2019s Word through this message.

Many other things we might give thee warning of (gentle Reader) if we had not exceeded the measure of a Preface already. It remaineth, that we commend thee to God, and to the Spirit of his grace, which is able to build further than we can ask or think. He removeth the scales from our eyes, the vail from our hearts, opening our wits that we may understand his word, enlarging our hearts, yea correcting our affections, that we may love it to the end. Ye are brought unto fountains of living water which ye digged not; do not cast earth into them with the Philistines, neither prefer broken pits before them with the wicked Jews. [Gen 26:15. Jer 2:13.] Others have laboured, and you may enter into their labours; O receive not so great things in vain, O despise not so great salvation! Be not like swine to tread under foot so precious things, neither yet like dogs to tear and abuse holy things. Say not to our Saviour with the Gergesites, Depart out of our coast [Matt 8:34]; neither yet with Esau sell your birthright for a mess of pottage [Heb 12:16]. If light be come into the world, love not darkness more than light; if food, if clothing be offered, go not naked, starve not yourselves. Remember the advice of Nazianzene, \"It is a grievous thing\" (or dangerous) \"to neglect a great fair, and to seek to make markets afterwards:\" also the encouragement of S. Chrysostom, \"It is altogether impossible, that he that is sober\" (and watchful) \"should at any time be neglected:\" [S. Chrysost. in epist. ad Rom. cap. 14. oral. 26.]\r\nLastly, the admonition and menacing of S. Augustine, \"They that despise God's will inviting them, shall feel God's will taking vengeance of them.\" [S. August. ad artic. sibi falso object. Artic. 16.] It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God; [Heb 10:31] but a blessed thing it is, and will bring us to everlasting blessedness in the end, when God speaketh unto us, to hearken; when he setteth his word before us, to read it; when he stretcheth out his hand and calleth, to answer, Here am I, here we are to do thy will, O God. The Lord work a care and conscience in us to know him and serve him, that we may be acknowledged of him at the appearing of our Lord Jesus Christ, to whom with the holy Ghost, be all praise and thanksgiving.

Christ came to take away sin (Vs. 5) and destroy the work of the devil (Vs. 8). The logical conclusion is that whoever is born of God (Vs. 9) and consequently abides in Him (Vs. 6) does not go on sinning and whoever does go on sinning has not seen God and has not known him (V. 6); he is not of God (Vs. 10).",

There is a trend today in modern charismatic circles to exorcise Satan when sin appears in the life; sin is attributed entirely to Satan as though man was the helpless victim. This trend diminishes the doctrine of Total Depravity and also the responsibility of man for his own actions. John does not regard sin as the devil working through the individual, but as the individual working for the devil and in his sin representing the devil. Sin is not a mere infirmity; it is not merely an imposition of Satan on us. John is emphasising that habitual sin is wilful lawlessness against God (Vs. 4) and the man who continues to sin is not at liberty to say \u2018the devil made me do it' by direct involvement.",

Tozer and spoke of him as one of the most influential voices in the Church in America. A.W. Tozer's materials are a mainstay in Evangelical churches in our day and he is one of the most quoted authors. He was a prophet in his day and his writings are even more influential in our day.

            "preacher_description": "Paris Reidhead (1919 - 1992)\r\nListen to freely downloadable audio sermons by the speaker Paris Reidhead in mp3 format. Was a Christian missionary, teacher, writer, and advocate of economic development in impoverished nations. A spiritual crisis during this period\u2014as he described two decades later in what is probably his best-known recorded teaching, \"Ten Shekels and a Shirt\"--left Reidhead with the conviction that much of evangelicalism had adopted utilitarian and humanistic philosophies contradictory to Biblical teaching. The end of all being, he came to believe, was not the happiness of man, but the glorification of God. This theme would recur throughout his later teaching.\r\n\r\nSince Mr. Reidhead's death in 1992, Bible Teaching Ministries, Inc. continues under the leadership of his wife, Marjorie, and daughter, Virginia Teitt, a dedicated Board, and the many people who have donated time and talent after being changed by God\u2019s Word through this message. The message of the Gospel is reaching an ever-widening audience all over the world.",
