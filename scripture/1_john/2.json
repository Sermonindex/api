            "description": "The Bible says that those who do these evil things will not go to heaven. It doesn't matter that you're given the last rites by a priest or even if all the ministers in the world are gathered to pray for you. A certain man continually got irritated with his wife and children. So he sought a place to be alone where he won't be disturbed. He found such a place but after two or three hours he suddenly realised that the things which really troubled him were within him. You can wash and perfume a pig, but the moment it's left alone, it will go and wallow in the mud. Why? Because it's a pig. So too, if you love the world, you might be in church physically, but the moment the protection is removed, you will wallow in the world, because the world is in your heart.",
