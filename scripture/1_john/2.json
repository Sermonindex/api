Yet, when we carefully study the Book of Acts we find that many practices in modern evangelical churches are not found in this record of the apostolic Church.",

Whilst explaining these in detail, he also shows that he is advocating neither salvation by works nor legality. Rather, these tests concern fruit-bearing. The manner of our life (ie, the fruit) evidences whether God has truly saved us or not. (34 minutes)",

These are: not loving the world; persevering in the faith; embracing the fullness of Christ\u2019s person; the practice of righteousness; and trust in the sole sufficiency of Christ. From various verses in 1st John, Mr Washer clearly explains each issue, and ends with a personal testimony from his own family life. (57 minutes)",

Have you experienced the \"expulsive power of a new affection\"?  Brother Zac shares ways to kindle a true hunger for Christ by meditating on how much He suffered for you on the cross, getting into fellowship with those who have a fervent love for Jesus, giving up whatever takes away your hunger for God, and others.",

It doesn't matter that you're given the last rites by a priest or even if all the ministers in the world are gathered to pray for you. A certain man continually got irritated with his wife and children. So he sought a place to be alone where he won't be disturbed. He found such a place but after two or three hours he suddenly realised that the things which really troubled him were within him. You can wash and perfume a pig, but the moment it's left alone, it will go and wallow in the mud. Why? Because it's a pig. So too, if you love the world, you might be in church physically, but the moment the protection is removed, you will wallow in the world, because the world is in your heart.",
