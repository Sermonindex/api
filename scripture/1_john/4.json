Our modern society is all about the quick fix, but there is no substitute for time when it comes to developing a genuine foundation of love in the godly home.",

            "description": "Delivered on Sabbath Morning, May 22nd, 1859. In this wonderful sermon, Spurgeon enlarges upon the \"love that God hath to us,\" which we have \"known and believed.\" He discourses here on \"knowing\" God's love for you, and \"believing\" in it, a two-fold experience. On knowing God's love for us, Spurgeon says that through seeing it in our lives, feeling it through the intimacy of Christ, and lastly through the witness of the Spirit do we come to know it. Then, there are seasons when \"all strength and hope are gone,\" and we \"behold nothing but the uttermost depths of despair.\" Now this person may not know God's love for him, but he can still believe in it. \"To believe it when you do not feel it, is the noblest,\" Spurgeon says. Then he expands on how God's love to us is undeserved, for there \"was nothing in us that could have caused it,\" there was never \"anything in us by nature that he could love.\" Oh, What an amazing thought to ponder on! Furthermore he says, \"the love of God towards us is free, sovereign, undeserved, and springs entirely from the overflowing love of his own heart, and is not caused by anything in us.\"",

When we behold the ebullient wonder of what God has made, \u201cwe ought to stop thinking like a scientist and start thinking like a psalmist. \u2026 Let us not think anymore of God as being heavy browed and gloomy! I repeat that when God made the heaven and earth, they sang together and all the sons of God shouted for joy! There wasn\u2019t a funeral at the creation of the world; there was an anthem, and all the creature creations sang! And at the incarnation they sang!\u201d There was singing at the resurrection and we\u2019ll sing at the rapture and the consummation, and the song will be \u201cWorthy is the Lamb!\u201d The message is firmly grounded in 1 John 4:12-16, John 17:20-23, and Revelation 5:9-11.

His love for the genuine believer will give us an incredible security about the future. God's love covers and empowers us to join Him in His redemptive purposes. By faith, receive the incredible love of God and allow His love to flow through you to those around you.",
