Brother Denny uncovers the fallacy that spanking solves all the woes in the family when a close, loving, flowing relationship between parent and child is missing.  Our modern society is all about the quick fix, but there is no substitute for time when it comes to developing a genuine foundation of love in the godly home.",

In this wonderful sermon, Spurgeon enlarges upon the \"love that God hath to us,\" which we have \"known and believed.\" He discourses here on \"knowing\" God's love for you, and \"believing\" in it, a two-fold experience. On knowing God's love for us, Spurgeon says that through seeing it in our lives, feeling it through the intimacy of Christ, and lastly through the witness of the Spirit do we come to know it. Then, there are seasons when \"all strength and hope are gone,\" and we \"behold nothing but the uttermost depths of despair.\" Now this person may not know God's love for him, but he can still believe in it. \"To believe it when you do not feel it, is the noblest,\" Spurgeon says. Then he expands on how God's love to us is undeserved, for there \"was nothing in us that could have caused it,\" there was never \"anything in us by nature that he could love.\" Oh, What an amazing thought to ponder on! Furthermore he says, \"the love of God towards us is free, sovereign, undeserved, and springs entirely from the overflowing love of his own heart, and is not caused by anything in us.\"",

He wrote the book: 'Why Revival Tarries' which has become a classic on revival. His prophetic edge and burden made him to be respected by some and disliked by others. Yet he stayed true to God's call on his life prayed and pleading for true heaven sent revival. \r\n\r\n\"Those who know of Leonard Ravenhill recognize in him the religious specialist, the man sent from God to battle the priests of Baal on their own mountain top, to shame the careless priest at the altar, to face the false prophet, and to warn the people who are being led astray by him. \" - Tozer | \"Leonard Ravenhill was one of the few men I have ever known who was a true prophet.\" - David Wilkerson",
