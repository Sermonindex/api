James continue to say that unless you continue to show by your life that you have the true faith, your faith is worthless. Faith is directional in a Person. Faith not only requires that something is held true, but that Someone has entered into your life. Grasp this secret or you've missed the crux of the matter. Faith is not believing a set of historical facts. All the historical facts about Jesus, that He was the perfect spotless Lamb of God, born of a virgin, died for our sins, was buried and rose again the third day - all of this the demons know to be true, but it doesn't help them. You need a special agreement with Jesus Christ, and then confess that commitment before people publicly. You must believe with the heart unto righteousness and confess with your mouth unto salvation (Rom 10:10).",

            "description": "You do not have to go around telling people to do this and not that for if they're truly saved they will know the Lord and do the right for He writes His law in the heart of His children. We read in Acts how the early Christians were all of one heart and mind (Acts 4:32). If you have this sixth sense you cannot fight among yourselves but are one with God's children. You feel the same about different matters. You will even see things in the same way. But it's a pity that very often among Christians there is disunity because some are still holding on to their sin and own way. Sin darkens your understanding. God gives this sixth sense to His children that they aim at the same thing, they see things in the same way.",

He empowers us by the Holy Ghost to be able to keep his word when we are willing to surrender our heart to his Lordship. A stirring word that will cause every sincere believer to examine his or her own heart. John 14:15 says if you love me you will keep my commandments.\u00a0 This is just the first of many other scriptures Brother Wilkerson uses to demonstrate the reality of what it means to love the Lord our God. It goes beyond feelings and sentiment. It involves more than your words. The Lord is looking for hearts that honestly reach out for him and has a desire to be obedient to his word.",
