Willie Mullan had a religious conversion and from that time forward he decided he would strive to serve God.\r\n\r\n In 1953 Willie Mullan was called to Lurgan Baptist church, and in August of that year he commenced the work in Lurgan. One of his great accomplishments during this time was the Tuesday night Bible class. Every Tuesday night hundreds attended to hear the exposition of the Word. In 1957 William Hewitt and a team of helpers commenced the tape recordings of the Bible class. At least 1500 of these recordings remain until this day.",

A \"20th-century prophet\" many called him during his lifetime. For 31 years A.W.Tozer was pastor of Southside Alliance Church in Chicago. He was involved in the missionary alliance movement for most of his pulpit life. A.W. Tozer lived in the presence of God he saw clearly and he spoke as a prophet to the church. He sought for God's honor with the zeal of Elijah and mourned with Jeremiah at the apostasy of God's people. \r\n\r\nLeonard Ravenhill was a close friend of pastor and writer A. W. Tozer and spoke of him as one of the most influential voices in the Church in America. A.W. Tozer's materials are a mainstay in Evangelical churches in our day and he is one of the most quoted authors. He was a prophet in his day and his writings are even more influential in our day. One of his books: The Pursuit of God, has had over 1 million copies sold world-wide.",

It is sad to see a person stricken in years when they age they become an invalid but God is still active in people of these days. God delivers us from circumstances but being a child of God does not give us super protection against trials and problems. If we know as a child of God that we will face problems like the rest of the world then in my problems God will be with us and we will have the assurance that God will see us through. What a hope that we have.. same as David saying: As the Lord liveth that shall deliver me out of all the distresses of my soul. God promises to us then what we ask, now to him that is able to give exceedingly abundantly above all that we can ask. God desires to give to us so much beyond what we need just as parents desire to do to children.",

It has been thought that the phrase tisbite means that he was really not an Israelite but that is not a firm believable interpretation. He comes to the backslidden northern tribe of Israel with a message and warning of God for the people. It is prophesied in Malachi that Elijah will come back. When Gabriel came to the Elizabeth and foretold of the child to be born and said that John the Baptist would be in the spirit and power of Elijah. Elijah also did appear in the mount of transfiguration with Jesus. In the revelation there is a speaking of 2 prophets and one will be Elijah showing up before Jesus comes back again. This is why the Jews always set an empty chair for Elijah knowing that Elijah will come first before the messiah comes.",

When stone is brought to the temple was not done at the temple but away from the city so there was no noise of the hammer at the construction of the temple. All the stones of the temple were marked off from the temple so when it came to the temple they knew it was there and were it should go. If they could not figure out where the stone fit then they would throw the stone away and this stone was covered with shrubs. They were looking for the chief cornerstone which was that stone they threw away. The stone that was rejected by the builders it the chief cornerstone. What a sobering visual of what the people of Israel did to the messiah. Peter proclaimed this the Sanhedrin and religious leaders. People did not build temples to dwell in but rather they were making the temple to have God to dwell in. An house for God and the common ordinary people were not allowed in the building, they were allowed in the porches but no in the building itself. But in the Christian life we have God dwelling with us in our hearts. What an amazing barrier and view God has opened up through the death and blood of Jesus Christ.",

God says he is going to hallow the temple that he built for God. If you serve other Gods then God will cut off the house of Israel if they forsook the Lord their God. If you will obey me and follow me then your family will be on the throne and because they did forsake the Lord they were cut out of the land. A lot of times there are warnings that come from the Lord through many ways, but whenever God speaks to you it is important if God took the time to speak to you. God always warns people in areas they are going to be tempted and tested later on in your life. Even if its something that I am confident in but God knows that down the road you will need to be relying on Him in that area. We need to glory in our weaknesses because we are depending on the Lord but rather Satan tries to trip us up in the areas that we feel confident in because we are not fully relying on the Lord in those areas.",

In I Kings 19, Elijah felt that way, even after God had defeated the priests of Baal by answering Isaiah's prayer and accepting his sacrifice. Isaiah even wished to die. In this sermon, Pastor Conlon discusses spiritual depression and how it may strike any one of us at any time -- and what to do about it if it does.",

We can learn to take heed to the many warnings from the lives of great men like David, Solomon, Elijah and others.    Imagine a book that begins with David and ends with Ahab!  The book of Kings shows how important God's leaders affect the spiritual state of God's people.  What could have been the result in Solomon's life had David last words been about marriage and godly leadership rather than revenge?  Solomon teaches us about spiritual discernment and misdirected energies that end in destruction.  Elijah gives various insights into the boldness that comes from God's presence and looking away from crows to God alone in spite of human weaknesses and frailties.",

There is a moment in everyone's life when God will come and whisper His truth in our hearts, that ALL THINGS ARE POSSIBLE when Christ is at the center of our lives. God has the power to break us into pieces and consume us, and He would be be completely justified in doing so, but it is not in His heart to do so. Christmas is a season that reminds us that no matter how many times we fail Him, He sent His son Jesus to carry us through our journey. God walks with those who walk with Him. He restores, He gives strength, He gives hope and provision. This season we are lovingly reminded that the supernatural life of Christ is entwined with the natural life of man and we become a new creation. This Christmas listen to the still small voice of Jesus and let Him fill your heart with JOY.",

The Bible clearly says if we forgive each other He will forgive us, but if we will not forgive others neither will He forgive us. Many of us will never grow in Grace because we are not willing to forgive those who have wounded us. Forgiveness is not an option it is a commandment from God.
