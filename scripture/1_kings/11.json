The difficulty lies in our allowing high places in our lives and homes. A high place is any provision for the flesh. Careful, prayerful self-examination will reveal your high places. The world is littered with the debris of what flesh has promised but unable to provide.",

He has raised up many pastors who are a part of the Calvary Chapel movement now and where he pastors the large Costa Mesa church in California.\r\n\r\nThe Calvary Chapel movement is based of simple principles that Chuck Smith taught over the years such as: The priority of agape love, Simple fellowship amongst the saints, the breaking of bread, the teaching of God's word chapter by chapter and verse by verse. And lastly and most importantly the principle not by might nor by power but by my spirit saith the Lord.",
