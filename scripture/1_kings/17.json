It has been thought that the phrase tisbite means that he was really not an Israelite but that is not a firm believable interpretation. He comes to the backslidden northern tribe of Israel with a message and warning of God for the people. It is prophesied in Malachi that Elijah will come back. When Gabriel came to the Elizabeth and foretold of the child to be born and said that John the Baptist would be in the spirit and power of Elijah. Elijah also did appear in the mount of transfiguration with Jesus. In the revelation there is a speaking of 2 prophets and one will be Elijah showing up before Jesus comes back again. This is why the Jews always set an empty chair for Elijah knowing that Elijah will come first before the messiah comes.",
