He was born in Newtownards, County Down, Ireland in 1911. In his book Tramp after God, he tells of living for more than three years as a tramp abusing alcohol and involved in crime. Willie Mullan had a religious conversion and from that time forward he decided he would strive to serve God.\r\n\r\n In 1953 Willie Mullan was called to Lurgan Baptist church, and in August of that year he commenced the work in Lurgan. One of his great accomplishments during this time was the Tuesday night Bible class. Every Tuesday night hundreds attended to hear the exposition of the Word. In 1957 William Hewitt and a team of helpers commenced the tape recordings of the Bible class. At least 1500 of these recordings remain until this day.",

In I Kings 19, Elijah felt that way, even after God had defeated the priests of Baal by answering Isaiah's prayer and accepting his sacrifice. Isaiah even wished to die. In this sermon, Pastor Conlon discusses spiritual depression and how it may strike any one of us at any time -- and what to do about it if it does.",

When the Lord has used His servant and His touch has come upon us there is a season of weeping and spiritual fatigue that will follow. It is in these seasons that satan himself will come with roaring accusations and attempt to lead us into a wilderness and a sense of powerlessness. It is complete fiction to believe the devil has any power to take you as a sincere believer from the security of your position through Christ in God. The devil can only come against us with roaring lies but in REALITY he has no power to do this. God Himself will come and whisper His mercy and love to show us we are not alone and evil will not triumph over us. He will vanquish our enemies with a still small voice and comfort and nourish us.",

God has the power to break us into pieces and consume us, and He would be be completely justified in doing so, but it is not in His heart to do so. Christmas is a season that reminds us that no matter how many times we fail Him, He sent His son Jesus to carry us through our journey. God walks with those who walk with Him. He restores, He gives strength, He gives hope and provision. This season we are lovingly reminded that the supernatural life of Christ is entwined with the natural life of man and we become a new creation.
