Based on the story of Jehoshaphat and Ahab in 1 Kings chapter 22, where the many prophets were prophesying \"go up and prosper\" while one, a true prophet of the Lord prophesied in truth.",

            "description": "There is great attack against those on the \"front lines\" in ministry. The devil is aiming all of his amunition toward those who \"love God and are the called according to His purpose.\" This is a message about the war with the principalities, a war that true Christian\u2019s fight each and every day.  This spiritual war was declared in the Garden of Eden but in these last days Satan is changing his plans.  Time is near and Satan knows that his time is short.  Since the cross, Satan has approached this spiritual warfare in a different way for those that are covered by the blood of Jesus Christ.",
