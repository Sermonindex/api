Men die and then they rot; thank God for the birth that is incorruptible and never dies!

Tozer preached \u201cThe Chief Cornerstone and Us Cornerstones,\u201d in Chicago, Illinois. It is the 19th message in a 34-part study of Peter\u2019s first epistle. We already know that the Bible is true; the big question is whether it is true in us. From 1 Peter 2:3-5, Pastor Tozer examines the terms, \u201ctasted,\u201d and \u201clively stones,\u201d and observes that Christians come out of the world, come away from the old life, come unto Christ, and come together. Drawing nearer to Jesus Christ is what draws Christians nearer to each other. The pastor also warns that we can get the gifts of God and then forget the God that gives. God gives himself in every gift, and it is God himself who matters more than all other gifts. The recording length is 38 minutes and 41 seconds.",

Tozer\u2019s superb study on First Peter, we examine with Dr. Tozer what the Holy Spirit means by the unanimity, compassion, pity, and courtesy of which Peter writes in verses 8 and 9 of the 3rd chapter. The pastor approaches these in his characteristically lively style, by telling us what they are not, in order that we may discover what they are. One should never mistake external uniformity for true inward unity, nor confuse empty etiquette with authentic courtesy, nor exalt rigid principles above concern for people and a supreme commitment to Christ the Lord. \u201cBe Ye All of One Mind\u201d was recorded in Chicago, Illinois, on Sunday, April 11, 1954.

With searing eloquence and sober erudition, Dr. Tozer sets forth an extremely encouraging message for all of Christ\u2019s servants and missionaries. He starts by taking us through Romans 8:33-39 to underscore the bold exhortation of 1 Peter 3:13. Nothing can harm a good man! \u201cNothing can debase his quality, nothing can reduce his dimensions, nothing can prevent the fulfillment of his destiny, nothing can block the accomplishment of his appointed task, and nothing can lower his value before God and the universe!\u201d With this May 16, 1954 sermon, Pastor Tozer marked one year from the beginning of his 34-part series on Peter\u2019s first epistle. \u201cWho is He That Will Harm You?\u201d is the 27th message, preached at Southside Alliance Church in Chicago, Illinois.

Because if it isn\u2019t found in more than one verse of the Bible, the chances are it isn\u2019t found there, either.\u201d Pastor Tozer preached the 29th part of his 34-part series on First Peter in Chicago, Illinois, on June 13, 1954.

If a believer is not overcoming 100% in a specific area, or is partaking in some worldly activity, one may judge and claim that believer is not saved. Such merely outward judging is not spiritual but an immature and dangerous thing to do. Of course, if a believer is blatantly continuing in outward sin he must be dealt with in gentleness and love. As God taught us through the Book of Acts and Epistles of Paul, corrective measures as determined by the Holy Spirit might be necessary.

            "description": "After the Lord\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s clear leading to use the name Gospel Fellowships there was a word search preformed on the internet and this statement of faith from one of the larger Chinese house Church networks called: China Gospel Fellowship was found. This was a surprise and great blessing for before we were never aware of this underground house Church name. After reading their statement of faith, there was an immediate burden to make this statement of faith available to Gospel Fellowships and to any other house Churches or groups that would like to identify with the statement. We believe it is a tremendous way for believers to be in unity worldwide with precious brothers and sisters in China who are experiencing a great expansion of the Church and revival.",

Many hymns and choruses that could be sung by memory and without instruments have been laid aside for more contemporary songs that have much musical accompaniment. The argument is not over styles of music or what is permissible in a worship setting but rather that a very powerful weapon of the Church has been lost. This occurs when we do not have many hymns and choruses that we can sing without instruments with a whole heart towards the Lord. Thus the burden here is to simply supply a resource of many old hymns, choruses and spiritual songs for reading, meditation and singing privately and corporately.",

Willie Mullan had a religious conversion and from that time forward he decided he would strive to serve God.\r\n\r\n In 1953 Willie Mullan was called to Lurgan Baptist church, and in August of that year he commenced the work in Lurgan. One of his great accomplishments during this time was the Tuesday night Bible class. Every Tuesday night hundreds attended to hear the exposition of the Word.

The hardest part of faith is the last half hour and just before the victory we give up turning away from God with a evil heart of unbelief. God will lead us into places where we are shut up and nothing short of a miracle will get us out of the situation. It is in these places of hopeless crisis that God will come through to glorify His name. We must stand on the promises of God with a heart full of faith declaring that God is faithful. Pastor Wilkerson examines the lives of Saul, Solomon and Samson as men of God who went into a crises of faith and failed the test. Our faith will be tried, as by fire.

He was born in Newtownards, County Down, Ireland in 1911. In his book Tramp after God, he tells of living for more than three years as a tramp abusing alcohol and involved in crime. Willie Mullan had a religious conversion and from that time forward he decided he would strive to serve God.\r\n\r\n In 1953 Willie Mullan was called to Lurgan Baptist church, and in August of that year he commenced the work in Lurgan. One of his great accomplishments during this time was the Tuesday night Bible class. Every Tuesday night hundreds attended to hear the exposition of the Word. In 1957 William Hewitt and a team of helpers commenced the tape recordings of the Bible class. At least 1500 of these recordings remain until this day.",

It is through these fiery trials that we come out with an inner strength that declares mo matter what happens the life of God in us cannot be triumphed over! The key to this kind of life is to be free of offence and to have a good conscience towards God and man and to refuse to speak evil in a difficult situation. It doesn't matter how we feel or what happens, we must always allow the Holy Spirit to lead us back in line with the truth of God's Word. Do you want to stand in the fire? Your strength comes from allowing God's Word to have the last say in every circumstance!",

This sermon examines the \"dark side of prayer\" -- that is, God's response to prayer from impure hearts and unclean hands. Prayer from an unrepentant and selfish heart will produce judgment rather than stopping it. The starting point for the message is God's judgment upon Nadab and Abihu in Leviticus 10 for offering \"strange fire\" on the altar of incense. This is a must-listen in this day of frequent calls to prayer -- prayer without repentance will do nothing but hasten judgment.",

We have to allow grace to have its perfect work in our lives, we have to believe that God loves our souls and sent his son to die for them.  Ron Reed discusses how too many people view Christianity as a passive experience, and points out how the Devil will devour and pick off stragglers very easily when they fail to engage in the Spiritual warfare against their own inner voice or soul.  A strong exhortation is given to actively engage in a devotional life with God that encompasses meditation on the word and prayer.  He also discussed how one of the principle weapons the enemy uses against us is speculation.",

Many other things we might give thee warning of (gentle Reader) if we had not exceeded the measure of a Preface already. It remaineth, that we commend thee to God, and to the Spirit of his grace, which is able to build further than we can ask or think. He removeth the scales from our eyes, the vail from our hearts, opening our wits that we may understand his word, enlarging our hearts, yea correcting our affections, that we may love it to the end. Ye are brought unto fountains of living water which ye digged not; do not cast earth into them with the Philistines, neither prefer broken pits before them with the wicked Jews. [Gen 26:15. Jer 2:13.] Others have laboured, and you may enter into their labours; O receive not so great things in vain, O despise not so great salvation! Be not like swine to tread under foot so precious things, neither yet like dogs to tear and abuse holy things. Say not to our Saviour with the Gergesites, Depart out of our coast [Matt 8:34]; neither yet with Esau sell your birthright for a mess of pottage [Heb 12:16]. If light be come into the world, love not darkness more than light; if food, if clothing be offered, go not naked, starve not yourselves. Remember the advice of Nazianzene, \"It is a grievous thing\" (or dangerous) \"to neglect a great fair, and to seek to make markets afterwards:\" also the encouragement of S. Chrysostom, \"It is altogether impossible, that he that is sober\" (and watchful) \"should at any time be neglected:\" [S. Chrysost. in epist. ad Rom. cap. 14. oral. 26.]\r\nLastly, the admonition and menacing of S. Augustine, \"They that despise God's will inviting them, shall feel God's will taking vengeance of them.\" [S. August. ad artic. sibi falso object. Artic. 16.] It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God; [Heb 10:31] but a blessed thing it is, and will bring us to everlasting blessedness in the end, when God speaketh unto us, to hearken; when he setteth his word before us, to read it; when he stretcheth out his hand and calleth, to answer, Here am I, here we are to do thy will, O God. The Lord work a care and conscience in us to know him and serve him, that we may be acknowledged of him at the appearing of our Lord Jesus Christ, to whom with the holy Ghost, be all praise and thanksgiving.

It is stated herein that one of the greatest libels against the cross in our day is the idea that the believer in the cross is absented from any form of suffering.  It is the cruciform life which will generate a necessary friction against the kingdoms of this world.  We must apprehend that this conflict is an intention of God through his people, and in every sense, a diet of the things of this world will by nature slicken any apprehension of this cross-centered friction.   The hearing of this sermon in its deepest of intentions will bring you face to face with Jesus calling you Satan, that is to say...you are Satanic if you cherish not the things of God over the things of man. We are admonished to take up the cross and follow Christ for, \"Natural man is always the instrument by which Satanic things are brought into being in the collision between kingdoms.\"",

In 1994, he founded Desiring God Ministries, which provides all of Piper's sermons and articles from the past three decades, and most of his books online free of charge, as well as offering for sale books, CDs, and DVDs and regularly hosting conferences.",
