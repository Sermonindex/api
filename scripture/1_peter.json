Pastor Tozer treats us to several very astute word studies: \u201cwherefore,\u201d \u201claying aside,\u201d \u201cguile,\u201d \u201chypocrisies,\u201d \u201cenvies,\u201d and \u201csincere milk.\u201d Without rebirth, the most promising child, the actress in Hollywood, the president in the White House, and the eugenicists\u2019 theoretical \u201csuper man,\u201d all exist beneath the same two, dark clouds: mortality and corruption. Men die and then they rot; thank God for the birth that is incorruptible and never dies!

We already know that the Bible is true; the big question is whether it is true in us. From 1 Peter 2:3-5, Pastor Tozer examines the terms, \u201ctasted,\u201d and \u201clively stones,\u201d and observes that Christians come out of the world, come away from the old life, come unto Christ, and come together. Drawing nearer to Jesus Christ is what draws Christians nearer to each other. The pastor also warns that we can get the gifts of God and then forget the God that gives. God gives himself in every gift, and it is God himself who matters more than all other gifts. The recording length is 38 minutes and 41 seconds.",

Tozer\u2019s 34-part study on Peter\u2019s first epistle explores \u201cThe Christian\u2019s Relation to Government.\u201d The words of 1 Peter 2:13-16 testify that human government is of divine order. However, Dr. Tozer debunks a myth that the Bible endorses the primitive concept of \u201cdivine right\u201d rule. He explains, \u201cThe father, as the paternal source of the family, and thus as head of the family, and naturally as protector, defender, and bread winner of the family, was the first ruler.\u201d Human government thus developed from the idea of the family. Furthermore, God\u2019s Truth transcends all politics and human government. The pastor concludes with the beautiful words of Hebrews 12:22-24. The message was recorded on March 7, 1954, in Chicago, Illinois, and is 29 minutes and 42 seconds in length.",

Through 1 Peter 2:17 and a loving exegesis of Psalm 104, Pastor Tozer illuminates two of \u201cthe five things the Christian should do if he is to grow in grace and in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ:\u201d 1) Venerate all things; 2) Honor all men; 3) Love all Christians; 4) Fear God; 5) Honor the authorities. \u201cVenerate All God\u2019s Creation\u201d is the 24th message in a 34-part study of Peter\u2019s first epistle.

Pastor Tozer bravely tackles the subject of how a woman should dress, by describing four general traits: clean, neat, modest, and appropriate. \u201cOn Wives and Their Place in Family Life\u201d is the 25th message in this 34-part study of Peter\u2019s first epistle.

The pastor approaches these in his characteristically lively style, by telling us what they are not, in order that we may discover what they are. One should never mistake external uniformity for true inward unity, nor confuse empty etiquette with authentic courtesy, nor exalt rigid principles above concern for people and a supreme commitment to Christ the Lord. \u201cBe Ye All of One Mind\u201d was recorded in Chicago, Illinois, on Sunday, April 11, 1954.

If a believer is not overcoming 100% in a specific area, or is partaking in some worldly activity, one may judge and claim that believer is not saved. Such merely outward judging is not spiritual but an immature and dangerous thing to do. Of course, if a believer is blatantly continuing in outward sin he must be dealt with in gentleness and love. As God taught us through the Book of Acts and Epistles of Paul, corrective measures as determined by the Holy Spirit might be necessary. This may include asking a believer to leave the Assembly for a period of time.",

It is accepted as the will of God at times to suffer601 and to even expect severe persecution. This type of suffering produces a joy602 and sense of privilege that they are willing to identify with their precious Lord who has saved them.",

One of the reasons for the continued existence and growth of the underground Church in North Korea is that they have not been dependent on a few highly esteemed leaders in the Church but have rather emphasized the raising up of all to be servant leaders who are able to edify and build the Church. At the same time the Church in North Korea recognizes whom God has specifically gifted as shepherds. Such servant leaders are esteemed but not idolized.",

After reading their statement of faith, there was an immediate burden to make this statement of faith available to Gospel Fellowships and to any other house Churches or groups that would like to identify with the statement. We believe it is a tremendous way for believers to be in unity worldwide with precious brothers and sisters in China who are experiencing a great expansion of the Church and revival.",

Many hymns and choruses that could be sung by memory and without instruments have been laid aside for more contemporary songs that have much musical accompaniment. The argument is not over styles of music or what is permissible in a worship setting but rather that a very powerful weapon of the Church has been lost. This occurs when we do not have many hymns and choruses that we can sing without instruments with a whole heart towards the Lord. Thus the burden here is to simply supply a resource of many old hymns, choruses and spiritual songs for reading, meditation and singing privately and corporately.",

The hardest part of faith is the last half hour and just before the victory we give up turning away from God with a evil heart of unbelief. God will lead us into places where we are shut up and nothing short of a miracle will get us out of the situation. It is in these places of hopeless crisis that God will come through to glorify His name. We must stand on the promises of God with a heart full of faith declaring that God is faithful. Pastor Wilkerson examines the lives of Saul, Solomon and Samson as men of God who went into a crises of faith and failed the test. Our faith will be tried, as by fire. If your faith is being tested, you should listen carefully to this message.",

It is through these fiery trials that we come out with an inner strength that declares mo matter what happens the life of God in us cannot be triumphed over! The key to this kind of life is to be free of offence and to have a good conscience towards God and man and to refuse to speak evil in a difficult situation. It doesn't matter how we feel or what happens, we must always allow the Holy Spirit to lead us back in line with the truth of God's Word. Do you want to stand in the fire? Your strength comes from allowing God's Word to have the last say in every circumstance!",

It is a message on the prayer, praise and worship that goes before the Lord.  If you have a fear of conviction or a desire to remain lukewarm or cold, this is not the message for you. This sermon examines the \"dark side of prayer\" -- that is, God's response to prayer from impure hearts and unclean hands. Prayer from an unrepentant and selfish heart will produce judgment rather than stopping it. The starting point for the message is God's judgment upon Nadab and Abihu in Leviticus 10 for offering \"strange fire\" on the altar of incense. This is a must-listen in this day of frequent calls to prayer -- prayer without repentance will do nothing but hasten judgment.",

There is a spiritual war waging around us at all times and many of us need to engage in this battle.  The problem is that we first have to win the battle within.  We have to allow grace to have its perfect work in our lives, we have to believe that God loves our souls and sent his son to die for them.  Ron Reed discusses how too many people view Christianity as a passive experience, and points out how the Devil will devour and pick off stragglers very easily when they fail to engage in the Spiritual warfare against their own inner voice or soul.  A strong exhortation is given to actively engage in a devotional life with God that encompasses meditation on the word and prayer.  He also discussed how one of the principle weapons the enemy uses against us is speculation.",

The contents breathe the spirit of Peter. His speeches recorded in Acts indicate a similar attitude toward persecution and suffering. The letter here reflects a time of suffering and trial. No doubt the widespread persecution of the Christians by the Roman authorities was the occasion of the \"fiery trial\" (4:12). The writer admonishes his readers to a life of purity, of godly living, and exhorts them to steadfastness and faithfulness",

            "description": "Starting with a quote from C.H. Spurgeon, \"Jesus bears not the cross so that you may escape it, but that you may endure it,\" this sermon delivers a message which adopts and adheres the previous two messages into our own bearing of the cross.  It is stated herein that one of the greatest libels against the cross in our day is the idea that the believer in the cross is absented from any form of suffering.  It is the cruciform life which will generate a necessary friction against the kingdoms of this world.  We must apprehend that this conflict is an intention of God through his people, and in every sense, a diet of the things of this world will by nature slicken any apprehension of this cross-centered friction.   The hearing of this sermon in its deepest of intentions will bring you face to face with Jesus calling you Satan, that is to say...you are Satanic if you cherish not the things of God over the things of man. We are admonished to take up the cross and follow Christ for, \"Natural man is always the instrument by which Satanic things are brought into being in the collision between kingdoms.\"",

This would be to partake of a supernatural life for the betterment of others. There are so many Christians today that follow Jesus for what they can get from Him.

He speaks on the sequence of election on how God has foreknowledge of the choices men make. There is much to be learnt from this sermon by any believer from any theological background. Note: comments about brother paul washer are made in their local church setting and is not way meant anyway to slander to demean this brothers name. SermonIndex.net fully supports and promotes Paul Washer's messages, there is much to be learnt from brother Paul no matter what theological backing you may be.",
