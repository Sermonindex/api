The message was preached in Chicago, Illinois on January 17, 1954. Pastor Tozer notes that 1 Peter 1:22 is perfect for a sermon, as it may be conveniently divided into 7 parts: 1) You have purified your souls; 2) By obeying the truth; 3) Through the Spirit; 4) Unto unfeigned love of the brethren; 5) See therefore that ye love one another; 6) Out of a pure heart; 7) Fervently. He also teaches quick but important refresher courses in homiletics, comparative religion, and apologetics (from Hebrews 11.) The length of the recording is 31 minutes and 36 seconds.",

If a believer is not overcoming 100% in a specific area, or is partaking in some worldly activity, one may judge and claim that believer is not saved. Such merely outward judging is not spiritual but an immature and dangerous thing to do. Of course, if a believer is blatantly continuing in outward sin he must be dealt with in gentleness and love. As God taught us through the Book of Acts and Epistles of Paul, corrective measures as determined by the Holy Spirit might be necessary. This may include asking a believer to leave the Assembly for a period of time.",

This was a surprise and great blessing for before we were never aware of this underground house Church name. After reading their statement of faith, there was an immediate burden to make this statement of faith available to Gospel Fellowships and to any other house Churches or groups that would like to identify with the statement. We believe it is a tremendous way for believers to be in unity worldwide with precious brothers and sisters in China who are experiencing a great expansion of the Church and revival.",

Many hymns and choruses that could be sung by memory and without instruments have been laid aside for more contemporary songs that have much musical accompaniment. The argument is not over styles of music or what is permissible in a worship setting but rather that a very powerful weapon of the Church has been lost. This occurs when we do not have many hymns and choruses that we can sing without instruments with a whole heart towards the Lord. Thus the burden here is to simply supply a resource of many old hymns, choruses and spiritual songs for reading, meditation and singing privately and corporately.",

The hardest part of faith is the last half hour and just before the victory we give up turning away from God with a evil heart of unbelief. God will lead us into places where we are shut up and nothing short of a miracle will get us out of the situation. It is in these places of hopeless crisis that God will come through to glorify His name. We must stand on the promises of God with a heart full of faith declaring that God is faithful. Pastor Wilkerson examines the lives of Saul, Solomon and Samson as men of God who went into a crises of faith and failed the test. Our faith will be tried, as by fire. If your faith is being tested, you should listen carefully to this message.",

He speaks on the sequence of election on how God has foreknowledge of the choices men make. There is much to be learnt from this sermon by any believer from any theological background. Note: comments about brother paul washer are made in their local church setting and is not way meant anyway to slander to demean this brothers name. SermonIndex.net fully supports and promotes Paul Washer's messages, there is much to be learnt from brother Paul no matter what theological backing you may be.",
