            "description": "\u201cOn Laying Aside Certain Things\u201d is part 18 of Pastor A. W. Tozer\u2019s delightful, 34-part series based upon Peter\u2019s first epistle. The message was preached in Chicago, Illinois, on January 24, 1954, and it addresses 1 Peter 2:1-3, as well as 1 Peter 1:23-25 (from Isaiah 40:6-7.) Pastor Tozer treats us to several very astute word studies: \u201cwherefore,\u201d \u201claying aside,\u201d \u201cguile,\u201d \u201chypocrisies,\u201d \u201cenvies,\u201d and \u201csincere milk.\u201d Without rebirth, the most promising child, the actress in Hollywood, the president in the White House, and the eugenicists\u2019 theoretical \u201csuper man,\u201d all exist beneath the same two, dark clouds: mortality and corruption. Men die and then they rot; thank God for the birth that is incorruptible and never dies! Drawing wisely from Socrates, Pastor Tozer also challenges those liberals who ask, instead of turning from wickedness, \u201cWhat is wickedness?\u201d The length of the recording is 39 minutes and 5 seconds.",

We already know that the Bible is true; the big question is whether it is true in us. From 1 Peter 2:3-5, Pastor Tozer examines the terms, \u201ctasted,\u201d and \u201clively stones,\u201d and observes that Christians come out of the world, come away from the old life, come unto Christ, and come together. Drawing nearer to Jesus Christ is what draws Christians nearer to each other. The pastor also warns that we can get the gifts of God and then forget the God that gives. God gives himself in every gift, and it is God himself who matters more than all other gifts. The recording length is 38 minutes and 41 seconds.",

He explains, \u201cThe father, as the paternal source of the family, and thus as head of the family, and naturally as protector, defender, and bread winner of the family, was the first ruler.\u201d Human government thus developed from the idea of the family. Furthermore, God\u2019s Truth transcends all politics and human government. The pastor concludes with the beautiful words of Hebrews 12:22-24.

            "description": "Christians in North Korea are expected to be servant leaders and Spirit filled, to share the Word, pray, and preach the Gospel. One of the reasons for the continued existence and growth of the underground Church in North Korea is that they have not been dependent on a few highly esteemed leaders in the Church but have rather emphasized the raising up of all to be servant leaders who are able to edify and build the Church. At the same time the Church in North Korea recognizes whom God has specifically gifted as shepherds. Such servant leaders are esteemed but not idolized.",

Many hymns and choruses that could be sung by memory and without instruments have been laid aside for more contemporary songs that have much musical accompaniment. The argument is not over styles of music or what is permissible in a worship setting but rather that a very powerful weapon of the Church has been lost. This occurs when we do not have many hymns and choruses that we can sing without instruments with a whole heart towards the Lord. Thus the burden here is to simply supply a resource of many old hymns, choruses and spiritual songs for reading, meditation and singing privately and corporately.",

Spurgeon, \"Jesus bears not the cross so that you may escape it, but that you may endure it,\" this sermon delivers a message which adopts and adheres the previous two messages into our own bearing of the cross.  It is stated herein that one of the greatest libels against the cross in our day is the idea that the believer in the cross is absented from any form of suffering.  It is the cruciform life which will generate a necessary friction against the kingdoms of this world.  We must apprehend that this conflict is an intention of God through his people, and in every sense, a diet of the things of this world will by nature slicken any apprehension of this cross-centered friction.   The hearing of this sermon in its deepest of intentions will bring you face to face with Jesus calling you Satan, that is to say...you are Satanic if you cherish not the things of God over the things of man. We are admonished to take up the cross and follow Christ for, \"Natural man is always the instrument by which Satanic things are brought into being in the collision between kingdoms.\"",
