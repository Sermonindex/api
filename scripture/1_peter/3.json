In the home, says Dr. Tozer, \u201cthere\u2019s place for recognition of the proper relationships and positions, but there is no place for domination.\u201d \u201cThe dominating wife is a product of sin and of unbelief,\u201d the pastor declares, \u201cand has no place whatsoever in the will of God.\u201d As for the husband, there is no biblical example, anywhere, for the brutal lord who rules his home with an iron hand. Pastor Tozer bravely tackles the subject of how a woman should dress, by describing four general traits: clean, neat, modest, and appropriate. \u201cOn Wives and Their Place in Family Life\u201d is the 25th message in this 34-part study of Peter\u2019s first epistle. It was preached in Chicago, Illinois on April 4, 1954, and its length is 29 minutes and 58 seconds.",

            "description": "In the 26th sermon of A. W. Tozer\u2019s superb study on First Peter, we examine with Dr. Tozer what the Holy Spirit means by the unanimity, compassion, pity, and courtesy of which Peter writes in verses 8 and 9 of the 3rd chapter. The pastor approaches these in his characteristically lively style, by telling us what they are not, in order that we may discover what they are. One should never mistake external uniformity for true inward unity, nor confuse empty etiquette with authentic courtesy, nor exalt rigid principles above concern for people and a supreme commitment to Christ the Lord. \u201cBe Ye All of One Mind\u201d was recorded in Chicago, Illinois, on Sunday, April 11, 1954. Its length is 36 minutes and 30 seconds.",

With searing eloquence and sober erudition, Dr. Tozer sets forth an extremely encouraging message for all of Christ\u2019s servants and missionaries. He starts by taking us through Romans 8:33-39 to underscore the bold exhortation of 1 Peter 3:13. Nothing can harm a good man! \u201cNothing can debase his quality, nothing can reduce his dimensions, nothing can prevent the fulfillment of his destiny, nothing can block the accomplishment of his appointed task, and nothing can lower his value before God and the universe!\u201d With this May 16, 1954 sermon, Pastor Tozer marked one year from the beginning of his 34-part series on Peter\u2019s first epistle. \u201cWho is He That Will Harm You?\u201d is the 27th message, preached at Southside Alliance Church in Chicago, Illinois.

            "description": "A critically important theology lesson designed to armor the people of God against heretics who use certain hard, obscure texts from the Bible to teach things that the Bible never says at all. In \u201cFalse Teaching on Obscure Teaching,\u201d A. W. Tozer demolishes several dark misrepresentations of First Peter 3:18-24 and 4:6, by shining upon them the brilliant light of the rest of God\u2019s Word. \u201cLet me give you a good working rule for the understanding of Scripture: if you haven\u2019t more than one verse to support it, don\u2019t teach it. Because if it isn\u2019t found in more than one verse of the Bible, the chances are it isn\u2019t found there, either.\u201d Pastor Tozer preached the 29th part of his 34-part series on First Peter in Chicago, Illinois, on June 13, 1954.

Submit, forgive yourself for your mistakes. Go to the cross for cleansing. Seek the Lord and he will do the work in you. Excellent message on spiritual warfare. Too many in the church don't have the spiritual authority the Lord said he gave his own over all power of the enemy. Paul warned in the last days people would have an appearance of godliness with no power. You can stand up to the devil and say enough! Enough of the powerlessness in your life. Enough of letting him by with laughing at you. Submit to God, and take back your family for God. Take back what the enemy has stolen.",

It is a message on the prayer, praise and worship that goes before the Lord.  If you have a fear of conviction or a desire to remain lukewarm or cold, this is not the message for you. This sermon examines the \"dark side of prayer\" -- that is, God's response to prayer from impure hearts and unclean hands. Prayer from an unrepentant and selfish heart will produce judgment rather than stopping it. The starting point for the message is God's judgment upon Nadab and Abihu in Leviticus 10 for offering \"strange fire\" on the altar of incense. This is a must-listen in this day of frequent calls to prayer -- prayer without repentance will do nothing but hasten judgment.",
