In the home, says Dr. Tozer, \u201cthere\u2019s place for recognition of the proper relationships and positions, but there is no place for domination.\u201d \u201cThe dominating wife is a product of sin and of unbelief,\u201d the pastor declares, \u201cand has no place whatsoever in the will of God.\u201d As for the husband, there is no biblical example, anywhere, for the brutal lord who rules his home with an iron hand. Pastor Tozer bravely tackles the subject of how a woman should dress, by describing four general traits: clean, neat, modest, and appropriate. \u201cOn Wives and Their Place in Family Life\u201d is the 25th message in this 34-part study of Peter\u2019s first epistle. It was preached in Chicago, Illinois on April 4, 1954, and its length is 29 minutes and 58 seconds.",

Tozer\u2019s superb study on First Peter, we examine with Dr. Tozer what the Holy Spirit means by the unanimity, compassion, pity, and courtesy of which Peter writes in verses 8 and 9 of the 3rd chapter. The pastor approaches these in his characteristically lively style, by telling us what they are not, in order that we may discover what they are. One should never mistake external uniformity for true inward unity, nor confuse empty etiquette with authentic courtesy, nor exalt rigid principles above concern for people and a supreme commitment to Christ the Lord. \u201cBe Ye All of One Mind\u201d was recorded in Chicago, Illinois, on Sunday, April 11, 1954.

Because if it isn\u2019t found in more than one verse of the Bible, the chances are it isn\u2019t found there, either.\u201d Pastor Tozer preached the 29th part of his 34-part series on First Peter in Chicago, Illinois, on June 13, 1954.

This sermon examines the \"dark side of prayer\" -- that is, God's response to prayer from impure hearts and unclean hands. Prayer from an unrepentant and selfish heart will produce judgment rather than stopping it. The starting point for the message is God's judgment upon Nadab and Abihu in Leviticus 10 for offering \"strange fire\" on the altar of incense. This is a must-listen in this day of frequent calls to prayer -- prayer without repentance will do nothing but hasten judgment.",

For over 70 years, the church was blessed and challenged by the prophetic ministry of Vance Havner. His style and burden was prophetic similar to the ministry of A.W. Tozer calling the Church to revival. His influence extended to a national level, but Dr. Havner's approach was always to minister where God directed, regardless of the size of the church.  His appeal and influence transcended denominational lines, and he spoke to many different groups of people.\r\n\r\nThroughout his ministry, Vance Havner lived and preached that a Christian should should exhibit faithfulness to Jesus in all areas of life.  He taught that the Christian should attend to, \"the outliving of the inliving Christ.\"  Havner wrote, \"To some, Christianity is an argument.  To many, it is a performance.  To a few, it is an experience.\"",
