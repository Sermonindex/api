W. Tozer explores 1 Peter 4:1-5 with ironclad logic, tempered by his distinctive spark of congenial wit. He contemplates the meaning of \u201cstrange,\u201d defines a Christian and the Christian perspective of time, and extols the virtues of a silent reply. Pastor Tozer\u2019s remarkable mind is at its best in this 28th message of his 34-part series on the first epistle of Peter. \u201cAfter Conversion, the Remainder of Your Life Should Be Different\u201d was recorded on June 6, 1954, in Chicago, Illinois. Its length is 23 minutes and 55 seconds.",

W. Tozer observes three ways to bear adversity, from verses 12 to 19 of chapter 4. He then warns with Peter that \u201cthe Christian faith is not to provide immunity for wrongdoers\u2026 The deacon who doesn\u2019t pay his bills, the pastor who leaves the city owing debts, he can not, he dare not, hide these evils behind clerical immunity, or Christian immunity.\u201d Dr. Tozer concludes on a note of powerfully compelling evangelism, with masterful analogies to support Peter\u2019s exhortation that we \u201ccommit the keeping\u201d of our souls to a faithful creator. The sermon was delivered on June 27, 1954, at Southside Alliance Church in Chicago, Illinois. Its length is 28 minutes and 50 seconds.",

It is accepted as the will of God at times to suffer601 and to even expect severe persecution. This type of suffering produces a joy602 and sense of privilege that they are willing to identify with their precious Lord who has saved them.",

It is through these fiery trials that we come out with an inner strength that declares mo matter what happens the life of God in us cannot be triumphed over! The key to this kind of life is to be free of offence and to have a good conscience towards God and man and to refuse to speak evil in a difficult situation. It doesn't matter how we feel or what happens, we must always allow the Holy Spirit to lead us back in line with the truth of God's Word. Do you want to stand in the fire? Your strength comes from allowing God's Word to have the last say in every circumstance!",

            "description": "This message was delivered on 06\/01\/1966. The glory of God is expressed in the trinity. God the Father is the source of glory. The Father takes personal responsibility for His children to bring them unto glory. Jesus Christ is the Lord of glory. He is the One that is in control to bring forth the glory of God. Jesus Christ is faithful to bring forth all of our adverse circumstances to work for His glory. The Holy Spirit is the Spirit of glory. The Spirit of glory can take hold of the things that would be to our own undoing and turn them for the glory of God.",
