One of the reasons for the continued existence and growth of the underground Church in North Korea is that they have not been dependent on a few highly esteemed leaders in the Church but have rather emphasized the raising up of all to be servant leaders who are able to edify and build the Church. At the same time the Church in North Korea recognizes whom God has specifically gifted as shepherds. Such servant leaders are esteemed but not idolized.",

Hence, in the end, leaders raise up other leaders, for that is the goal; true servanthood\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s aim is for others.

There is a spiritual war waging around us at all times and many of us need to engage in this battle.  The problem is that we first have to win the battle within.  We have to allow grace to have its perfect work in our lives, we have to believe that God loves our souls and sent his son to die for them.  Ron Reed discusses how too many people view Christianity as a passive experience, and points out how the Devil will devour and pick off stragglers very easily when they fail to engage in the Spiritual warfare against their own inner voice or soul.  A strong exhortation is given to actively engage in a devotional life with God that encompasses meditation on the word and prayer.  He also discussed how one of the principle weapons the enemy uses against us is speculation.",

This would be to partake of a supernatural life for the betterment of others. There are so many Christians today that follow Jesus for what they can get from Him. What about you will you refuse the fellowship of Christ for your own gain or will you take the low road and be spent for the cause of Christ?",
