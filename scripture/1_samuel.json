            "description": "It was critical that Israel pursued thye retreating Philistines after what the Lord had done but king Saul placed the people under a forced forced fast in order that he would appear spiritual before them, thus he did it for his own glory and not the glory of God.  This day the Israelite army needed their physical strength to totally wipe out the oppresive Philistines but they had none due to Sauls fast.  Jonathan however had not taken the oath to fast because he had been off fighting the Philistines with his armour bearer, so he came back and ate some honey, which was when he was challenged by one of the people, and when he heard this he said how wrong his father had been and told of how if it wasn't for his fathers fast they would have defeated the Philistines in a mighty way.  Saul had sinned greatly against the Lord in this and thus when he went to enquire of the Lord what he should do the Lord would not answer him.",

Samuel the prophet takes Saul, the future king, and anoints him king privately and in a way that shows how the Lord wants to anoint every believer with the Holy Ghost, how He should fill our lives.  The Lord then confirms that Saul is to be made king by giving Saul 3 very specific signs.  The last sign was that thje Holy Ghost would come upon Saul and change him into a new man as spiritual confirmation of the physical anointing that Saul had received.  So Saul was turned into another man, Samuel gathered all the people of Israel together and revealed Saul as their future king and the people rejoiced because he 'looked the part' but Samuel knew that Saul had very little spiritual subsatnce.",

He stands before the people and asks them to declare if he has ever wronged them or defrauded them or let them down in any way, which is a challenging thing for a leader to do before their people.  The people respond and say that Samuel has not wronged them at any time.  By this public challenge Samuel confirmed that he was passing on a good legacy to Saul and that if the nation went downhill from their it was not Samuels fault.  He declares to them all the righteous acts that the Lord has done to them how He brought them out of Egypt, raised up judges to rule over them and taught them discipline through affliction.  He recalls the events that effected the nation of Israel right up to the battle with Nahash in the previous chapter and shows the people the big picture of how the Lord has been faithful to them.",

David however does not approach Saul to discuss a dowery and so Saul offers his daughter to another man in order that he might make David jelous.  But David keeps a pure heart before the Lord and actually wins a victory by being submissive and humble before the Lord.  David also did not suspect that Saul had ulterior motives in offering his daughter to David. Then Sauls youngest daughter Michal fell in love with David and this pleased Saul as he could again manipulate this situation for David's hurt, so Saul proposes a price for his daughter, 100 Philistine foreskins, knowing that it was highly likely that David would be killed in meeting the price, however the Lord was with David and delivered him 200 Philistine foreskins.  This extra effort is straight out of the teaching of the Lord Jesus who commanded to 'go the second mile' and thus show a humility and a servants heart, which David surely had.",

She exalts the King, the Anointed One, the Messiah and was the first person to proclaim the God would be the Messiah a theme that was later shwon through all the prophets but Hannah saw it first.  There isw a shift in this passage though in the form of the corrupt sons of the high priest Eli, who didn't know the Lord and by their actions were causing the people of God to hate offering to God as the people knew that the priesthood was so corrupt.  Samuel however served the Lord as a small child and was dressed in priests clothes that his mother would make for him and bring to Shiloh every year, and the Lord further blessed her with 3 more sons and 2 daughters.",

Hannah is greived because she is barren, a situation which was possibly the worst place a woman could be in the Old Testament.  Every year Elkanah and his two wives would go up to Shiloh to the feast and Peninnah would mock Hannah becasue she had not children and Peninnah did.  This caused incredible sorrow in the heart of Hannah, but she did the right thing and poured out her grief before the Lord.  She made a vow to the Lord that if He would give her a son she would dedicate him to the Lord in a deeper and stronger way be seperating him as a Nazerite to the Lord, the remarkable moment came when after she had grieved before the Lord her sorrow left her and her faith in God was restored, did she concieve that moment? no, but God's word was just as sure and she praised Him for it. The Lord opened her womb and she gave birth to one of the most remarkable men in the Bible, Samuel.",

David discouraged by this went, with his men, back to their home in Ziklag, but when thy get in sight of the city they see smoke coming up out of it and not smoke from cooking, so they rush home to find the city totally empty, all their families had been taken by the Amalekites, then men began to dispair and turned on David desiring that they might stone him to death.

David goes to the tabernacle of God at Nob, to Ahimelech the priest, this was th right thing to for David to do to go to the house of the Lord.  But when he is asked what is going on by Ahimelech David lies to him several times in order to protect himself and maybe also Ahimelech from Saul.  David asks the priest for food, and all that is available is the shew bread which was used in the tabernacle to symbolize how the Lord desires to have fellowship with us.  So Ahimelech gives David the shewbread even though it was usually eaten by the priests, this shows that serving a human need is of greater importance than observing priestly traditions.  Does the Edomite, a servant of Saul was there and witnessed what was happening.  Finally David asks for a weapon from Ahimelech and he gioves him Goliaths sword, which David takes, the Lord was probably reminding David that the last time he held that sword he won a great victory as he was in the will of God and didn't need to resort to the flesh to deliver him.",

He was a man with all the right looks and yet had very little susbstance.  Saul here is helping out his father who has lost his donkeys, so Saul and his servant head out to find the donkeys, with no knowledge of what is about to befall them.  They wander from town to town asking and looking after the donkeys until they get to a certain town and decide to ask the prophet who is their if he knows where the donkeys are.  This shows Saul had little spiritual substance as he doesn't even recongise Samuel the prophet, and has no intention of asking him about his own spiritual condition, but is only interested inthe location of the lost donkeys.  The first thing Samuel tells Saul is that he will reveal to Saul what God has planned for his life, and then straight after tells him where the lost donkeys are,without Saul even asking.  So Samuel invites Saul to a feast and puts him in the place of most prominence and tells him that he is the future king of Israel!!",

This was a very strange thing for David to do as he has also killed thousands of Philistines, as well as Goliath.  So David is captured by them and imprisoned.  David knowing he has done wrong does the right thing and cries out to God, this is when he wrote Psalm 56 and it can be seen in this Psalm how David's heart is turned back to the Lord as he cries out for mercy.  He is then brought before Achish the king, David pretends to be mad which must have taken great humility to act that way before his enemies so Achish releases David and on his way from Gath David praises the Lord mightily, Psalm 34.  The Lord showed His love to David even though David did not deserve it, which shows the great love and mercy of God.  David then heads for the cave of Adullam from which you can see the valley where David slew Goliath and David lamented and wrote Palm 142.",

So Samuel arrives in Bethlehem to meet the new king, Jesse brings all of his sons before Samuel but Samuel says that the Lord has chosen none of them, then finally Jesse brings David, the youngest, from looking after the sheep, and Samuel is surprised for David is just a boy probably between 10 and 15, but the Lord knows Davids heart.  Dabid had spent his life thus far being obedient out in the fields looking after the sheep and drawing close to God, he had also been in a few fights with wild animals from which the Lord had delivered him, thus David trusted in the Lord.

This was due to Saul's resistence to the the Holy Spirit, he had spent so long rebelling against the Spirit of the Lord that he no longer wanted to have the Spirit so He left him, and the vacuum was filled by an evil spirit which Saul wanted as was shown by his actions.  The servants of Saul knew what had happened to him and asked if they should bring someone to worship the Lord before the king and lift his mood.  So they went out and found David who was a skillful player of the harp and was already described as a man of war both in the sphere of physical and spiritual warfare.  Pastor Guzik tells of how worship is indeed a battleground, and espescially music as it is so powerful in speaking to our inner man either for good or for evil.",

The people of Israel in the surrounding area hear of what has happened and abandon their homes and flee.  The Philistines take Sauls body and cut off his head and use it as a grisly trophy to show their victory.  But the men of Jabesh Gilead go to the city where the philistines have chained up the bodies of Saul and his sons and take them back and give them proper burial and mourne for the loss.  David mourns when he hears that his king has been killed he shows no bitterness or rejoicing but calls Saul the beauty of Israel.",

If these animals would have been sacrificed to the Lord as Saul desired it would have been a sacrifice of disobedience and the Lord would not have accepted it anyway, as to obey is better than sacrifice.  The Lord could see Saul's heart in all this and saw how rebellious and stubborn he was for this the Lord had to reject Saul from being king over Israel, but even through all this Saul did not repent but begged for Samuel to honor him before the people, Samuel turned and worshipped the Lord as he knew that the Lord would deal with Saul and he no longer had anything to say to Saul.  Agag king of the Amalekites was then brought before Samuel, but Samuel hacked him to pieces before the Lord and was unmerciful towards him as the Lord had commanded.",

So David enquires of the Lord what he souls do and the Lord tells him to go, David's men however dont want to go as they are afraid, so David enquires of the Lord a second time, and the Lord tells him to go to Keilah and he will deliver the Philistines into his hand.  Saul hears that David is on his way to Keilah and seizes the chance to capture David, so he assembles the armies of Israel to attack David and his band of men.  David then enquires of the Lord again as to whether the people of Keilah will deliver him into the hand of Saul and the Lord tells David that they will, this is probably due to the fact that previously Saul had had a whole town wiped out for not delivering David to him.  David therefore humbles himself and retreats, even though he coudl have probably fought Saul and maybe killed him, again David left him to the Lord, and diverted needless slaughter from another place.",

So David told Saul how the Lord had delivered a lion and a bear into his hand and that he had killed them when they came to attack the sheep he looked after, this was the Lord training David to fight Goliath.  Saul tried to put his fleshly armour on David but it didn't and David renounced it for his trust was in the armour of God.  So David took 5 stones from the brook and drew near to Goliath to challenge him, Goliath mocked him but David filled with the Spirit charged at Goliath hurled a stone at him and killed him in one hit, then David took Goliaths sword and cut off his head.

Somehow either by Saul's bad aim or by David's quickness the spear misses him, and David esacpes, this amazingly he does twice, how many of us would have gone back into that environment knowing that the second time it could mean our very lives.  David though even though he was a mighty warrior who could have retaliated and killed Saul, did not fight back but instead escaped knowing that the Lord would avenge him of Saul.  So Saul then made David leader of an elite group of men thinking that David would be killed on the battle field by the Philistines, but David remained wise before the Lord and He kept him, and David, to Sauls great dismay, grew even more popular with the people as the Lord blessed him.",

But David still shows great mercy to Saul, in that he wont allow Abishai to do it, so they take the spar and the jug that is near Saul and leave the camp.  David then when he is a long way away cries to Abner, and accuses him of not being vigilent for his king and shows the spear and the jug.

            "description": "Saul was obsessed with capturing David and sought him daily but the Lord delievered David out of the hand of Saul every time.  David was oppressed in the heart of his trial so the Lord sent Jonathan to him to strenthen him. Jonathan remind David of the Lord's promises to him how David will be king of Israel and that even Saul knows this, but Jonathan goes to far in what he is saying to David and says that he will be next to David when he is king, this sadly wouldn't come to pass as Jonathan would be killed in battle beofre David even came to the throne.  When Jonathan leaves David the Ziphites go and betray David into the hand of Saul, it was then that David wrote Psalm 54 and as seen in the psalm David puts his whole trust in the Lord and his heart is filled with praise to God.  Sauls army is just about to encircle David when a messanger comes to Saul and informs him that the philistines are invading and the Israel is under attack so Saul has to leave off from David and defend Israel.",

It was here that the soul of Jonathan the heir to the throne was knit to the soul of David, youngest son of a sheep farmer, why? becuase of their love of the Lord.  Jonathan takes off all his princely apparel and gives it to David as he knows that David, not himself, is going to be the next king of Israel.  This is a picture of our relationship with the Lord Jesus who, laid aside His glory and dwelt amongst us so that He could array in His robe of righteousness.  This was the high point of David and Sauls relationship, Saul sent David out to fight the Philistines, and David won a resounding victory, becaue the Lord was with him, but the people began to love David more than Saul and this caused Saul to become Jealous and he became suspicious of David from that day on, David on the other hand did not get proud but acted wisely before the Lord.",

However it wasn't long before the men of Bethshemesh became curious to know what was actually in the Ark, so they opened it and the Lord kiled them for it.  This shows that there are some things that God has chosen not to reveal to us and it is sin to press God to try an find out things that He does not want to reveal to us.  This judgement lead to a great fear spreading over the people as they realized the holiness of God, that God is not man and is far beyond us and thus is seperate from us.  This is what attracts people to God because He is beyond us, but when people come to know Him and see his holiness and 'otherness' we become fearful as we are not holy before a holy God.  But praise God there is someone who can stand between us and God, the Lord Jesus.",

After suffering a crushing defeat of 4000 men the leaders of Israel tried to persuade god to fight for them by bringing the Ark of the Covenant, this was a great mistake as they put their faith in the Ark of God and not in the God of the Ark.  This displayed the vain superstitions the people of Israel were embracing at the time.  The priests that brough the Ark tio the camp were the two sons of Eli who the Lord had already declared were under judgement.  When the Ark arrived their was a great shout in the camp and the Philistines became afraid as they knew that the Ark represented the God of Israel and that He was mightier than their gods, but despite this they did not submit to Him but fought the more viciously against the Israelites.  Becasue God was not with Israelites they not only lost awefully but the Ark was taken and the sons of Eli were killed in the smae day, just as the Lord had said would happen.",

As a child Samuel served in the house of the Lord at Shiloh under Eli the High priest, Eli had chosen not to rebuke his sons for their wickedness and for this the Lord held him responsible, one night the Lord told Samuel, still a child, to tell Eli that he would take the priesthood from Eli.  Eli asked Samuel what the Lord had said and Samuel told him everything.  He chose to obey the Lord over popularity.  Saul was anointed king over Israel but in a moment of panic offered a sacrifice to the Lord which was forbidden to do, when Samuel, now the prophet of God, challenged him Saul chose to make excuses for his actions instead of repenting.  David was a man after God's own heart and chose to love the Lord when he was alone with the sheep in the fields where there were none to see him, David still a boy became and man of God and most likely in this time wrote Psalm 23.",

This was over 400 years ago but shows us that time does not erase sin beofre the Lord and He had given the Amalekites all this time to repent but they didn't so the Lord pronounced judgement on them.  So Saul went and attacked the Amalekites and killed some of them but kept Agag, their king alive, and also some of their best livestock.  This grieved the Lord and Samuel and when Saul told Samuel what he had done Samuel rebuked him fopr his pride as it had led to self deception.

They had learned lesson from their Biblical history in that would no longer harden their hearts towards the Lord as the Egyptians had done inb the time of Moses.  But before sending the Ark back they decided to perform on last test to see if what had happened was at the hand of the Lord or all the events had just happened by chance.  They placed the Ark on a cart pulled by 2 milk cows, which had never pulled anything before in their lives, they took the cows from their calves, set them on a road they had never been on and sent them away with no driver.  The philistines had 'stacked the deck' against God to see if it was actually Him who had punished them for these 7 months.  So they stood back and watched in amazement as the cows took the exact route to Bethshemesh guided by the invisible hand of Almighty God, God will get His glory even if He has to glorify Himself.",

After a few days of Samuel not coming to offer the sacrifice Saul decides to off the sacrifice himself, which was a major sin as he was a king not a priest, and just after the sacrifice is offered Samuel comes over the hill to find to his horror Saul has not waited for him, and thus not waited for the Lord's timing.  Samuel offers Saul an opportunity to repent but instead he makes excuses, so Samuel tells him that the Lord has rejected him as king and has found a man after His own heart to rule the people.",

So Saul not knowing what to do goes to enquire of the Lord, but the Lord wouldn't answer him either by dreams, Urim or prophets, this is because Saul had been in open rebellion to the Lord for years now andhad departed from Him.  So Saul panics and seeks a medium who would give him advice.  So the servants of Saul tell him of a woman in Endor, so Saul disguises himself and goes to her and asks her to bring up Samuel the prophet from the dead, and when Samuel comes the medium is terrified and realises who Saul is.  Samuel asks Saul why he has brought him up and Saul says that the Lord has departed from him, when really Saul had departed from the Lord, and he doesn't know what to do, but Samuel reminds Saul that the Lord had promised to tear the kingdom out of his hands and that is just what is going to happen because the time that had elapsed had not atoned for Saul's sin.  So Samuel tells Saul that the day after he would die and gave Saul one last chance to repent, but he didn't.",

So the Israelites came to him and told him that they rejected his sons from ruling over them because of their ungodly lives, however instead of his sons they wanted a king to rule over them instead, the reason for this lay in their desire to be just like the surrounding nations, it is very dangerous for the people of God to want to be like the those in the world around them.  Samuel was saddened by this decision from the people and poured out his complaint before the Lord, as we should do.  But the Lord reassured Samuel and told him that that it wasn't him they were rejecting but the Lord Himself.  This was prophetic of the rejection of the Lord Jesus by the the people of Israel before Pilate.  So the Lord told Samuel to tell the people of Israel what kind of king they would have, and he did, but the people still demanded a king and so the Lord gave them the king they deserved.",

Goliath was mountain of a man some say he was aroung 9ft tall, and this is reflected in the size and weight of his armour, he was a man of war from his youth and was in the philistine army army for one reason, to instill fear into their enemies.  On the first day of battle Goliath headed out and stood before the army of Israel and challenged them to send out one man to fight with him, one on one, and this terrified the Israelites and their king Saul, who was the tallest in their army.  Satan today uses the exact same tactics as Goliath did in that he roars at us and makes us afraid when God is on our side and there is no reason to fear what he or man might do to us.  David arrives at the battle to bring supplies to his brothers who were in the army at the time and hears Goliath's challenge, but David instead of seeing Goliaths size and armour saw an uncircumsized idolater who was defying the living God, David knew this was a cause worth fighting for so he accepted Goliaths challenge.",

God needed a man that would speak to the people for Him and hear from God. There was really no mans ears that were open to God. Hannah prayed and gave her child to God if she would have a child. God delays his answers so that it is for His glory and that we would learn to pray aright. Most of our prayers are personal requests to God we are usually thinking of ourselves. If we pray according to Gods will then it will be granted. But we are usually thinking of what we want in regards to asking God. Eli the priest was watching Hannah praying and saw her mouth moving but no words so he thought she was drunk. This shows the low spirituality of the high priest that he could not discern that she was in the spirit and prevailing in prayer with God for his child and the petitions she asked. Once she heard from God she was very joyfully she has faith and believed in God what he said to her. An mark of faith is to act that I have it before I even have it, if God has promised it to us. We need to have a joyful attitude.",

Samuel is stepping down and is basically be dealing with Saul and other figures but not with the people. Samuel told the people that the Lord treated them right and that God was faithful to Israel through Egypt and coming into the promised land. They were delivered from the hands of their enemies. God was fair and just and so God gives this plea of His faithfulness to the people but they still wanting in their hearts to have a king. And by choosing this they are rejecting God as king and are wanting a human king like all the nations. But still God gives them mercy saying if you have a king you still will have to keep the commandments of God and He will show mercy. So therefore God gave Israel another chance through their weakness and the calling is to serve the Lord will all their heart.",

The bible gives a detailed description of his armor and was said to be an awesome sight in the sight of the children of Israel. He comes out every day for 40 days to challenge the children of Israel and nobody goes out to the challenge. David was sent to give some food and get word from his brothers about the army and the battle, then he hears Goliaths challenge and has a godly stirring in his heart against this uncircumcised heathen. Goliath is defying the armies of the living God and David went into Saul to ask permission being only a child. David carries around the head of Goliath for 2 whole days even into the presence of King Saul after the slaughter of the giant. Jonathan and David had a deep bond which they had right away. Saul kept David with the army and would not allow him to leave for awhile. Wherever Saul would go he stayed with him and he was accepted in the sight of the people even though he was so young.",

            "description": "In the wilderness area where David was hiding there are lots of places to hide and spot out people moving about. David is a very daring and courageous person, he sneaks out into the camp of Saul and creeps right into the cave where Saul was sleeping. David said who can stretch out his hand against the anointed of God. Even though the anointing has left Saul; David still had a deep respect for Gods calling and use of King Saul. Some people murmur and complain against pastors and think they can do a better job then the pastor. There needs to be a sense of Gods calling on a pastor and letting him hear from God of what he should be doing. Once a person gets his mind on critism then it grows and grows and becomes a cancer and they become critical in all things. There needs to be a respect for Gods calling on a man in authority. God was still using King Saul and had plans for his life and its awesome to see David recognize that even in the position he was in fleeing from Saul\u2019s unjust attacks on him.",

They wanted to have a man to fight their battles, someone they could see, like the world around them had, to go before them, rather than the undefeatable, Almighty God fighting for them. They didn't want to forsake their own ideals and let God be Lord of their life. Saul was representative of this rebellion and illustrates the danger of this kind of stronghold.",

A stubborn person has an inner flaw and this inner flaw doesn't show until they are called to put all they are in the hands of God and walk in obedience. A stubborn person can appear humble, zealous and even excercise spiritual gifts, but there comes a certain point they can't get passed. They can't lay down their inner thoughts of the way things should be done and surrender to God's ways. God will allow a sense of emptiness come into our souls to get our attention. He is looking for a sincere heart to submit to the authority of His Word. When we choose to obey Him the power of sin and decay is cancelled in our lives. The only way out of stubbornness is to HUMBLE ourselves before God.",

It is humiliating to observe that certain ministers have pampered and petted men in unbelief and distrust of God, being in this matter false to their Master, and to the souls of his people. Far be it from me to smite the feeble of the flock; but their sins I must and will smite, since it is my firm conviction, that to doubt the kindness, the faithfulness, and the love of God, is a very heinous offense. Unbelief is akin to Atheism. Atheism denies God's existence- unbelief denies his goodness, and since goodness is essential to God, these doubts do, in reality, stab at his very being. That can be no light sin which makes God a liar; and yet unbelief does in effect, cast foul and slanderous suspicion upon the veracity of the Holy One of Israel. That can be no small offense which charges the Creator of heaven and earth with perjury; and yet, if I mistrust his oath, and will not believe his promise, sealed with the blood of his own Son, I count the oath of God to be unworthy of my trust...",

His Sunday morning sermons were also broadcast around the world on radio.[1] He was the Founder and Chairman of the Board of Olford Ministries International in Memphis, Tennessee which became The Stephen Olford Center at Union University. His authorized biography, Only One Life, was written by John Philipps.\r\nIn 1953, Dr. Stephen F. Olford's years of pastoral ministry began by serving the Duke Street Baptist Church in Richmond, Surrey England (1953\u20131959) and then the Calvary Baptist Church in New York City (1959\u20131973).[1] Olford systematized his method of expository preaching and formed a curriculum used to train preachers at the Olford Institute for Biblical Preaching in Memphis, Tennessee.

We see that those of Zadok are righteous and concerned with holiness while those of Abiathar are concerned with gain and \"minister to the people's idols.\" The text ranges through the ministries of Zadok and Abiathar in 1 and 2 Samuel and finishes with Ezekiel's vision of faithful Zadokite priests in God's new Temple (the Body of Christ).",

There comes a time when God doesn't have to speak anymore because you already know what He wants you to do. God says put away the old man and put away the old nature. He is seeking for a man after His own heart who would simply walk in obedience with Him. Are you embracing something that God has clearly told you to put away?

There won't be a noise and striving to be recognized. That is the person in whose life the Holy Spirit can be released. Some people nullify a good word from heaven because they get in strife, whether it's other's behaviors, or our own. When God gives us a word, he intends to stand by it. But when our lifestyle is out of order, it's hard for us to know God. It restricts what God wants to do in our homes. This is why Christianity doesn't work at home.",
