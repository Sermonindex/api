            "description": "The Bible is a real book with stories about real people and this is seen here in 1 Samuel in the life of Hannah, her husband Elkanah and Peninnah his second wife.  Hannah is greived because she is barren, a situation which was possibly the worst place a woman could be in the Old Testament.  Every year Elkanah and his two wives would go up to Shiloh to the feast and Peninnah would mock Hannah becasue she had not children and Peninnah did.  This caused incredible sorrow in the heart of Hannah, but she did the right thing and poured out her grief before the Lord.  She made a vow to the Lord that if He would give her a son she would dedicate him to the Lord in a deeper and stronger way be seperating him as a Nazerite to the Lord, the remarkable moment came when after she had grieved before the Lord her sorrow left her and her faith in God was restored, did she concieve that moment? no, but God's word was just as sure and she praised Him for it. The Lord opened her womb and she gave birth to one of the most remarkable men in the Bible, Samuel.",

            "description": "The bible says that the eyes of the Lord go out to and fro the earth till he finds someone that is seeking Him. God needed a man that would speak to the people for Him and hear from God. There was really no mans ears that were open to God. Hannah prayed and gave her child to God if she would have a child. God delays his answers so that it is for His glory and that we would learn to pray aright. Most of our prayers are personal requests to God we are usually thinking of ourselves. If we pray according to Gods will then it will be granted. But we are usually thinking of what we want in regards to asking God. Eli the priest was watching Hannah praying and saw her mouth moving but no words so he thought she was drunk. This shows the low spirituality of the high priest that he could not discern that she was in the spirit and prevailing in prayer with God for his child and the petitions she asked. Once she heard from God she was very joyfully she has faith and believed in God what he said to her. An mark of faith is to act that I have it before I even have it, if God has promised it to us. We need to have a joyful attitude.",

Yet that is exactly what Hannah did, in spite of the fact she was provoked sore by her adversary, and mocked for her barrenness. The enemy will come and lie to you accusing you, telling you God sees your flaws and has withdrawn from you. Hannah began to fast and pray, so desperate for God to birth something in her that she was willing to give it back to him if he would. And he did. We can appropriate this lesson for our own lives.
