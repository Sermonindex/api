So the people of jabesh Gilead ask for one week to ask for help of the rest of Israel, Nahash agrees.  So the men of Jabesh Gilead send out messengers to ask for help, one of which come to Saul and tells him all that is going on, Saul is infuriated and the Spirit of the Lord comes upon him and he calls upon all Israel to come and fight the Ammonites with him, so Saul amasses and army of 330,000 people and the make their way to Jabesh Gilead.  Where Nahash is utterly defeated by the armies of Israel and the people hail Saul as their new king, but thankfully Saul gives all the glory to the Lord who fought for them, so both outward and inward battles were won.",

            "description": "Saul was hiding inadmist the people. God told Samuel the prophet where to find him so that he could be anointed King of Israel. Samuel is stepping down and is basically be dealing with Saul and other figures but not with the people. Samuel told the people that the Lord treated them right and that God was faithful to Israel through Egypt and coming into the promised land. They were delivered from the hands of their enemies. God was fair and just and so God gives this plea of His faithfulness to the people but they still wanting in their hearts to have a king. And by choosing this they are rejecting God as king and are wanting a human king like all the nations. But still God gives them mercy saying if you have a king you still will have to keep the commandments of God and He will show mercy. So therefore God gave Israel another chance through their weakness and the calling is to serve the Lord will all their heart.",
