            "description": "Samuel, the man of God, comes before the people to publically pass the torch on to Saul as the new ruler of the people of Israel.  He stands before the people and asks them to declare if he has ever wronged them or defrauded them or let them down in any way, which is a challenging thing for a leader to do before their people.  The people respond and say that Samuel has not wronged them at any time.  By this public challenge Samuel confirmed that he was passing on a good legacy to Saul and that if the nation went downhill from their it was not Samuels fault.  He declares to them all the righteous acts that the Lord has done to them how He brought them out of Egypt, raised up judges to rule over them and taught them discipline through affliction.  He recalls the events that effected the nation of Israel right up to the battle with Nahash in the previous chapter and shows the people the big picture of how the Lord has been faithful to them.",

            "description": "Samuel addresses the people and shows them how that wanting a king beofre the Lord's time was a sin and a wrond thing to do, but he reassures them that the Lord is rich in mercy and that if they will turn to the Lord and worship and serve Him from that day on that the Lord will bless them.  This is like us in our christian walk how it does not matter what wrong we have done or sin we have committed that if we will turn to the Lord and worship Him now He will send blessing.  The people of Israel had a head knwoledge of God but no heart knwoledge they knew all about the Lord but did not know Him.  Despite the behavior of the people in the past Samuel promises to continue to interceed for the people and instruct them in the way of the Lord and encourages them to serve Him because of all the good He has done to them.",

They wanted to have a man to fight their battles, someone they could see, like the world around them had, to go before them, rather than the undefeatable, Almighty God fighting for them. They didn't want to forsake their own ideals and let God be Lord of their life. Saul was representative of this rebellion and illustrates the danger of this kind of stronghold.",
