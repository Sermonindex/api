            "description": "Samuel, Saul and David, three of the most memorable people to appear in the scriptures made choices early on in their lives that would influence their entire lives from then on. As a child Samuel served in the house of the Lord at Shiloh under Eli the High priest, Eli had chosen not to rebuke his sons for their wickedness and for this the Lord held him responsible, one night the Lord told Samuel, still a child, to tell Eli that he would take the priesthood from Eli.  Eli asked Samuel what the Lord had said and Samuel told him everything.  He chose to obey the Lord over popularity.  Saul was anointed king over Israel but in a moment of panic offered a sacrifice to the Lord which was forbidden to do, when Samuel, now the prophet of God, challenged him Saul chose to make excuses for his actions instead of repenting.  David was a man after God's own heart and chose to love the Lord when he was alone with the sheep in the fields where there were none to see him, David still a boy became and man of God and most likely in this time wrote Psalm 23.",

            "description": "Here we are introduced to one of the great men in this book of 1 Samuel, Jonathan who was a remarkable military leader and also son of Saul the king.  Jonathan leads an army against the local philistine garrison and wins a resounding victory, even though Saul his father took the credit for it, but the philistines didn't like this at all and decided to amass an army to put down this 'rebellion' in the people of Israel who they oppessed.  the people of Israel were fearful before going into battle and realised they need the Lord to fight for them, so Saul calls for Samuel to offer a sacrifice and bless them before the battle.  After a few days of Samuel not coming to offer the sacrifice Saul decides to off the sacrifice himself, which was a major sin as he was a king not a priest, and just after the sacrifice is offered Samuel comes over the hill to find to his horror Saul has not waited for him, and thus not waited for the Lord's timing.  Samuel offers Saul an opportunity to repent but instead he makes excuses, so Samuel tells him that the Lord has rejected him as king and has found a man after His own heart to rule the people.",
