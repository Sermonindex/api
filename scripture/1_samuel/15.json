            "description": "Samuel rebukes Saul for his and his pride, but Saul argues that he has indeed followed the Word of God, but this is because he was self deceived and goes even furhter as to blame the people for bringing back the animals for sacrifice.  If these animals would have been sacrificed to the Lord as Saul desired it would have been a sacrifice of disobedience and the Lord would not have accepted it anyway, as to obey is better than sacrifice.  The Lord could see Saul's heart in all this and saw how rebellious and stubborn he was for this the Lord had to reject Saul from being king over Israel, but even through all this Saul did not repent but begged for Samuel to honor him before the people, Samuel turned and worshipped the Lord as he knew that the Lord would deal with Saul and he no longer had anything to say to Saul.  Agag king of the Amalekites was then brought before Samuel, but Samuel hacked him to pieces before the Lord and was unmerciful towards him as the Lord had commanded.",

This was over 400 years ago but shows us that time does not erase sin beofre the Lord and He had given the Amalekites all this time to repent but they didn't so the Lord pronounced judgement on them.  So Saul went and attacked the Amalekites and killed some of them but kept Agag, their king alive, and also some of their best livestock.  This grieved the Lord and Samuel and when Saul told Samuel what he had done Samuel rebuked him fopr his pride as it had led to self deception.  Saul tried to blame everyone else and that he was being actually being spiritual but Samuel gave him a word from the Lord...",

A stubborn person has an inner flaw and this inner flaw doesn't show until they are called to put all they are in the hands of God and walk in obedience. A stubborn person can appear humble, zealous and even excercise spiritual gifts, but there comes a certain point they can't get passed. They can't lay down their inner thoughts of the way things should be done and surrender to God's ways. God will allow a sense of emptiness come into our souls to get our attention. He is looking for a sincere heart to submit to the authority of His Word. When we choose to obey Him the power of sin and decay is cancelled in our lives. The only way out of stubbornness is to HUMBLE ourselves before God.",

Saul killed off the worthless lifestock and that which was despised, but the good and precious he held back. He also let Agag, the most evil of all the Amalekites live.

At some point we have to realize that the same God who created the universe lives inside of us and will enable us to accomplish all that He's called us to do. There comes a time when God doesn't have to speak anymore because you already know what He wants you to do. God says put away the old man and put away the old nature. He is seeking for a man after His own heart who would simply walk in obedience with Him. Are you embracing something that God has clearly told you to put away?
