So Samuel arrives in Bethlehem to meet the new king, Jesse brings all of his sons before Samuel but Samuel says that the Lord has chosen none of them, then finally Jesse brings David, the youngest, from looking after the sheep, and Samuel is surprised for David is just a boy probably between 10 and 15, but the Lord knows Davids heart.  Dabid had spent his life thus far being obedient out in the fields looking after the sheep and drawing close to God, he had also been in a few fights with wild animals from which the Lord had delivered him, thus David trusted in the Lord.  Samuel anoints David but oil but the Lord anointed him then with the Holy Spirit.",

            "description": "The Spirit of the Lord comes upon David and leaves Saul, and an evil spirit comes and distresses him.  This was due to Saul's resistence to the the Holy Spirit, he had spent so long rebelling against the Spirit of the Lord that he no longer wanted to have the Spirit so He left him, and the vacuum was filled by an evil spirit which Saul wanted as was shown by his actions.  The servants of Saul knew what had happened to him and asked if they should bring someone to worship the Lord before the king and lift his mood.  So they went out and found David who was a skillful player of the harp and was already described as a man of war both in the sphere of physical and spiritual warfare.  Pastor Guzik tells of how worship is indeed a battleground, and espescially music as it is so powerful in speaking to our inner man either for good or for evil.",

            "description": "Samuel, Saul and David, three of the most memorable people to appear in the scriptures made choices early on in their lives that would influence their entire lives from then on. As a child Samuel served in the house of the Lord at Shiloh under Eli the High priest, Eli had chosen not to rebuke his sons for their wickedness and for this the Lord held him responsible, one night the Lord told Samuel, still a child, to tell Eli that he would take the priesthood from Eli.  Eli asked Samuel what the Lord had said and Samuel told him everything.  He chose to obey the Lord over popularity.  Saul was anointed king over Israel but in a moment of panic offered a sacrifice to the Lord which was forbidden to do, when Samuel, now the prophet of God, challenged him Saul chose to make excuses for his actions instead of repenting.  David was a man after God's own heart and chose to love the Lord when he was alone with the sheep in the fields where there were none to see him, David still a boy became and man of God and most likely in this time wrote Psalm 23.",
