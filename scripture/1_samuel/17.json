            "description": "David is brought before Saul because of his willingness to challenge Goliath, but Saul see the battle from an earthly perspective, and purely in the flesh, he thought there was no way that David could win, but David knew that the Lord was with him and that there was no way he could lose!  So David told Saul how the Lord had delivered a lion and a bear into his hand and that he had killed them when they came to attack the sheep he looked after, this was the Lord training David to fight Goliath.  Saul tried to put his fleshly armour on David but it didn't and David renounced it for his trust was in the armour of God.  So David took 5 stones from the brook and drew near to Goliath to challenge him, Goliath mocked him but David filled with the Spirit charged at Goliath hurled a stone at him and killed him in one hit, then David took Goliaths sword and cut off his head.  The Philistines were shocked and fled but the army of Israel chased after them led by David.",

            "description": "This is the account of Davids fight with Goliath.  Goliath was mountain of a man some say he was aroung 9ft tall, and this is reflected in the size and weight of his armour, he was a man of war from his youth and was in the philistine army army for one reason, to instill fear into their enemies.  On the first day of battle Goliath headed out and stood before the army of Israel and challenged them to send out one man to fight with him, one on one, and this terrified the Israelites and their king Saul, who was the tallest in their army.  Satan today uses the exact same tactics as Goliath did in that he roars at us and makes us afraid when God is on our side and there is no reason to fear what he or man might do to us.  David arrives at the battle to bring supplies to his brothers who were in the army at the time and hears Goliath's challenge, but David instead of seeing Goliaths size and armour saw an uncircumsized idolater who was defying the living God, David knew this was a cause worth fighting for so he accepted Goliaths challenge.",

            "description": "Goliath came out in the battlefield of the philistines being over 9 feet tall. The bible gives a detailed description of his armor and was said to be an awesome sight in the sight of the children of Israel. He comes out every day for 40 days to challenge the children of Israel and nobody goes out to the challenge. David was sent to give some food and get word from his brothers about the army and the battle, then he hears Goliaths challenge and has a godly stirring in his heart against this uncircumcised heathen. Goliath is defying the armies of the living God and David went into Saul to ask permission being only a child. David carries around the head of Goliath for 2 whole days even into the presence of King Saul after the slaughter of the giant. Jonathan and David had a deep bond which they had right away. Saul kept David with the army and would not allow him to leave for awhile. Wherever Saul would go he stayed with him and he was accepted in the sight of the people even though he was so young.",

Satan will seek to draw us away from loving and obeying God, from prayer, and from our position of faith.  To do so will result in failure.  But we must stand strong in the Lord and believe Christ for the victory.",
