            "description": "Hannah gave Samuel back to the Lord with a song of joy in her heart, she was full of joy even though she had to give up her 3 year old son, she praised God but also explains how we should humble ourselves before God, or He will humble us, the Lord resists the proud but gives grace to the humble and lifts them up and out of their dire situations just as he did with Hannah.  She exalts the King, the Anointed One, the Messiah and was the first person to proclaim the God would be the Messiah a theme that was later shwon through all the prophets but Hannah saw it first.  There isw a shift in this passage though in the form of the corrupt sons of the high priest Eli, who didn't know the Lord and by their actions were causing the people of God to hate offering to God as the people knew that the priesthood was so corrupt.  Samuel however served the Lord as a small child and was dressed in priests clothes that his mother would make for him and bring to Shiloh every year, and the Lord further blessed her with 3 more sons and 2 daughters.",

            "description": "The capturing of the Ark of God by the Philistines is both a sad event but also good news, for it is the first step towards finding a resting place at Solomon's temple.  The Philistines are that natural part of me (the flesh, the old man) that must be dealt with first.  Having Samuel (the child heart, the resting heart, the listening ear) in our lives does not secure victory over the lordship of the Philistines; it is only the starting point.

He is training a holy remnant that will be solely dedicated to God and His work during these last days. God is raising up a people who are committed to him and his cause who are a holy remnant, and who are steadfast and sure of their God. Eli was judged soft on sin and allowed wickedness in the tabernacle at Shiloh; even his own sons. Today, the church world is a laughing stock because of wickedness in the house of God, there is no power or spiritual authority, no presence of the Lord in many churches. But there is an unseen remnant of people, who would surprise you, because they are not prominent, or well known, but they are shut in with and hearing a word from God. And the word is prepare, for judgment is coming.",

There comes a point when God's people transgress and God withdraws His presence. This is a warning to us in the New Covenant that we are not to test the Lord and not presume His presence with us without following Him in obedience.",

            "description": "From the \"Call to Repentance\" conference in Tifton, Ga. in 1986, this message looks at the ministries in the Church today and shows how they compare to two priesthoods in the Old Testament: the Zadok priesthood and the Abiathar (Eli) priesthood. We see that those of Zadok are righteous and concerned with holiness while those of Abiathar are concerned with gain and \"minister to the people's idols.\" The text ranges through the ministries of Zadok and Abiathar in 1 and 2 Samuel and finishes with Ezekiel's vision of faithful Zadokite priests in God's new Temple (the Body of Christ).",
