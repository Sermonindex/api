Jonathan desiring to help David offers him a deal that if Jonathan goes and asks Saul why he wants to kill David and discovers what his intentions are for David then David, when he becomes king of Israel, will not wipe out all the remaining memebers of Jonathans family.  David agrees, so Jonathan heads of to Sauls monthly metting for his leaders and David stays in hiding, as David is abscent the first day Saul presumes he is unclean and thus cannot attend the feast, but Jonathan informs Saul that David has gone to a feast at his families house.  Then when David doesn't turn up the second day Saul is enraged and demands to know where David is that he might kill him.
