Th ifrst thing the Lord did was to give David Himkself, and David was filled with a great sense of the Lord's power and glory.  The second thing the Lord gave to David was the support of his family, who in times past had been harsh towards David.  Then the Lord brough the needy and discouraged to David, and he became their leader, he took care of his parents by taking them to the Moabites, who were David's ancestors.  King saul in the meentime is plotting against David and accusing all his military commanders of being against him, one steps forward, Doeg the Edomite and informs Saul that he saw David being helped by Ahimelech the priest, Sauls is furiuos and goes to Ahuimelech and accueses him of aiding the enemies of the king, Ahimelech had no idea that David was on the run from Saul due to Davids lies, but Saul didn't care and commanded all the priests and their families to be slaughtered, Sauls servants wouldn't do it but Doeg would and massacred a great number of people, when David heard of this he mourned and wrote Psalm 52.",
