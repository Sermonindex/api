            "description": "David is told to go to the city of Keilah, because the Philistines are attacking it.  So David enquires of the Lord what he souls do and the Lord tells him to go, David's men however dont want to go as they are afraid, so David enquires of the Lord a second time, and the Lord tells him to go to Keilah and he will deliver the Philistines into his hand.  Saul hears that David is on his way to Keilah and seizes the chance to capture David, so he assembles the armies of Israel to attack David and his band of men.  David then enquires of the Lord again as to whether the people of Keilah will deliver him into the hand of Saul and the Lord tells David that they will, this is probably due to the fact that previously Saul had had a whole town wiped out for not delivering David to him.  David therefore humbles himself and retreats, even though he coudl have probably fought Saul and maybe killed him, again David left him to the Lord, and diverted needless slaughter from another place.",

            "description": "Saul was obsessed with capturing David and sought him daily but the Lord delievered David out of the hand of Saul every time.  David was oppressed in the heart of his trial so the Lord sent Jonathan to him to strenthen him. Jonathan remind David of the Lord's promises to him how David will be king of Israel and that even Saul knows this, but Jonathan goes to far in what he is saying to David and says that he will be next to David when he is king, this sadly wouldn't come to pass as Jonathan would be killed in battle beofre David even came to the throne.  When Jonathan leaves David the Ziphites go and betray David into the hand of Saul, it was then that David wrote Psalm 54 and as seen in the psalm David puts his whole trust in the Lord and his heart is filled with praise to God.  Sauls army is just about to encircle David when a messanger comes to Saul and informs him that the philistines are invading and the Israel is under attack so Saul has to leave off from David and defend Israel.",
