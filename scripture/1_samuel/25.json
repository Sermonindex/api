            "description": "Samuel the prophet and last judge of Israel dies at the beginning of this chapter and all Israel laments his passing, it is notable that he probably recveived more appreciation when he died than when he was alive.\r\nThere was a man of Carmel whose name was Nabal (which in the hebrew means fool) and he was a rich and very successful sheep farmer, and he had a wifie, Abigail, who was very beautiful and wise and completely different to Nabal.  David and his men had been protecting Nabal and his possessions for some time from bands of marauders and theives, and so when the sheep shearing season started, which was the best and most prosperous time of the year, David requests a gift from Nabal for services rendered, Nabal not only says no but 'no' in the most insulting way possible, and when David hears of this he is enraged and vows to kill Nabal and al his household.  Now when Abigail hears what Nabal has done she collects as much food as she can and heads out to meet David knowing he is intent on massacre.",

            "description": "David is on his way to Nabals house to massacre everone there when, suddenyl a woman leading a large company meets him on his way, she gets off her mount and bows herself down to the ground before him, this is quite a surprise for David as Abigail was a woman of great status and so to see her humbling herself in this way is very odd.  She asks David for mercy and to lay the blame on herself, she reminds David that he is the one who goes out and fights the Lord's battles, this must have pricked Davids heart as he surely knew that what he was intending to do was not in the heart of the Lord, David by the grace of God realises what he is doing and departs praising the Lord for sending Abigail.  Nabal on the other hand is totally unaware of what could have happened and is throwing a party when Abigail returns, the morning after she tells him of the previous days events and he is so shocked that he dies 10 days later.  David sends fo Abigail and takes her and Ahinoam for his wives as Sauls daughter had been given to someone else.",

Bro. Wilkerson illustrates through the life of David in the scriptures how not to react to the wickedness of men when you are angry, in the flesh. We need to learn to stand in the gap in intercession and not fear what is coming on the earth in these last days, because the Lord will keep his own secure.",
