            "description": "Saul again is in pursuit of David even though the last time they met he swore to cease from his quest for Davids life.  The army  come to halt to rest for the night and David sends out scouts to find where they are, when he knows David personally goes into the very midst of the sleeping camp right to where Saul is asleep next to Abner his personal bodyguard and captain of Israels armies.  Abishai who is with David in the midst of the camp requests that David give him permission to plunge Saul's own spear, which is stuck in the ground near his head, through his heart, Abishai says he only needs one chance and he will kill Saul there and then.  But David still shows great mercy to Saul, in that he wont allow Abishai to do it, so they take the spar and the jug that is near Saul and leave the camp.  David then when he is a long way away cries to Abner, and accuses him of not being vigilent for his king and shows the spear and the jug.  Saul again realising that David could have easily killed him realises his wrong again and asks for David to forgive him, which David does, showing the principle that the Lord Jesus laid down that if someone sins against us we are to forgive everytime.  Saul again leaves off his pursuit of David and this was the last time that they ever met.",

            "description": "In the wilderness area where David was hiding there are lots of places to hide and spot out people moving about. David is a very daring and courageous person, he sneaks out into the camp of Saul and creeps right into the cave where Saul was sleeping. David said who can stretch out his hand against the anointed of God. Even though the anointing has left Saul; David still had a deep respect for Gods calling and use of King Saul. Some people murmur and complain against pastors and think they can do a better job then the pastor. There needs to be a sense of Gods calling on a pastor and letting him hear from God of what he should be doing. Once a person gets his mind on critism then it grows and grows and becomes a cancer and they become critical in all things. There needs to be a respect for Gods calling on a man in authority. God was still using King Saul and had plans for his life and its awesome to see David recognize that even in the position he was in fleeing from Saul\u2019s unjust attacks on him.",
