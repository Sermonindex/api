            "description": "The Philistines again attack Israel in a very aggresive way, reaching right into the heart of the land.  So Saul not knowing what to do goes to enquire of the Lord, but the Lord wouldn't answer him either by dreams, Urim or prophets, this is because Saul had been in open rebellion to the Lord for years now andhad departed from Him.  So Saul panics and seeks a medium who would give him advice.  So the servants of Saul tell him of a woman in Endor, so Saul disguises himself and goes to her and asks her to bring up Samuel the prophet from the dead, and when Samuel comes the medium is terrified and realises who Saul is.  Samuel asks Saul why he has brought him up and Saul says that the Lord has departed from him, when really Saul had departed from the Lord, and he doesn't know what to do, but Samuel reminds Saul that the Lord had promised to tear the kingdom out of his hands and that is just what is going to happen because the time that had elapsed had not atoned for Saul's sin.  So Samuel tells Saul that the day after he would die and gave Saul one last chance to repent, but he didn't.",

He discusses why it is so important that we are raised from the dead, and how focusing on \u2018gaining entrance heaven\u2019 is actually counterproductive, since it bypasses the very heart of God and His grand plan.
