David discouraged by this went, with his men, back to their home in Ziklag, but when thy get in sight of the city they see smoke coming up out of it and not smoke from cooking, so they rush home to find the city totally empty, all their families had been taken by the Amalekites, then men began to dispair and turned on David desiring that they might stone him to death.  David also deeply concerned did the only thing he could do in the situation, strengthened himself in the Lord his God.",
