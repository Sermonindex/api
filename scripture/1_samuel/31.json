            "description": "The final day of king Sauls life finally arrives, the day the Lord warned him about probably 15-20 years before,  Saul goes into battle with the armies of Israel against the Philistines.  The battle goes very badly for Saul and he finds himself in the heat of the fight due to his army retreating, Saul sons including Jonathan Davids close beloved friend are killed and Saul is pierced with arrows.  Knowing that he is going to die he asks his armour bearer to kill him so that he will not be captured and ridiculed by the philistines, but his amrour bearer doesn't and so Saul falls upon his own sword and takes his own life, even here on the last day of his life knowing how soon he will stand before almighty God Saul doesn't repent.  The people of Israel in the surrounding area hear of what has happened and abandon their homes and flee.  The Philistines take Sauls body and cut off his head and use it as a grisly trophy to show their victory.  But the men of Jabesh Gilead go to the city where the philistines have chained up the bodies of Saul and his sons and take them back and give them proper burial and mourne for the loss.  David mourns when he hears that his king has been killed he shows no bitterness or rejoicing but calls Saul the beauty of Israel.",
