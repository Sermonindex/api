            "description": "Here the Israelites are at war with their neighbours the Philistines, who had superior military technology for that time due to their widespread trade routes.  After suffering a crushing defeat of 4000 men the leaders of Israel tried to persuade god to fight for them by bringing the Ark of the Covenant, this was a great mistake as they put their faith in the Ark of God and not in the God of the Ark.  This displayed the vain superstitions the people of Israel were embracing at the time.  The priests that brough the Ark tio the camp were the two sons of Eli who the Lord had already declared were under judgement.  When the Ark arrived their was a great shout in the camp and the Philistines became afraid as they knew that the Ark represented the God of Israel and that He was mightier than their gods, but despite this they did not submit to Him but fought the more viciously against the Israelites.  Becasue God was not with Israelites they not only lost awefully but the Ark was taken and the sons of Eli were killed in the smae day, just as the Lord had said would happen.",

The Philistines' capture of the Ark revolves around our natural man trying to make the Ark (Jesus) happy.  God humbles us with plagues and does a mighty miracle to show us that there is no resting place for Him in our flesh.",

            "description": "Brother Maxwell speaks on the main hindrance to revival in the Scripture, and the main hindrance today: our own sin. The reason we don't see God move is that we think that someone else besides us is blocking the moving of the Spirit. Included is a very interesting narrative about Dr. Ernest M. Wadsworth that documents his efforts for ministers to look inward to unblock the hindrance to revival, as well as many angry church members that called him during the week after being told to 'make your crooked places straight.' \"I went to the office of the mayor and was ushered into a private room. After I was seated, he said, 'I heard your sermon yesterday morning, now; man to man, I want to know who's been telling you about me?'\"",
