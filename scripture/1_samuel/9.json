            "description": "Here we are introduced to one of the main characters in the book, a tall dark and hansome man from a wealthy family, by the name of Saul.  He was a man with all the right looks and yet had very little susbstance.  Saul here is helping out his father who has lost his donkeys, so Saul and his servant head out to find the donkeys, with no knowledge of what is about to befall them.  They wander from town to town asking and looking after the donkeys until they get to a certain town and decide to ask the prophet who is their if he knows where the donkeys are.  This shows Saul had little spiritual substance as he doesn't even recongise Samuel the prophet, and has no intention of asking him about his own spiritual condition, but is only interested inthe location of the lost donkeys.  The first thing Samuel tells Saul is that he will reveal to Saul what God has planned for his life, and then straight after tells him where the lost donkeys are,without Saul even asking.  So Samuel invites Saul to a feast and puts him in the place of most prominence and tells him that he is the future king of Israel!!",
