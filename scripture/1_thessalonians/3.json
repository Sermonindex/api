He was born in Newtownards, County Down, Ireland in 1911. In his book Tramp after God, he tells of living for more than three years as a tramp abusing alcohol and involved in crime. Willie Mullan had a religious conversion and from that time forward he decided he would strive to serve God.\r\n\r\n In 1953 Willie Mullan was called to Lurgan Baptist church, and in August of that year he commenced the work in Lurgan. One of his great accomplishments during this time was the Tuesday night Bible class. Every Tuesday night hundreds attended to hear the exposition of the Word. In 1957 William Hewitt and a team of helpers commenced the tape recordings of the Bible class. At least 1500 of these recordings remain until this day.",

Recently, we heard of a pastor of a church in America who felt led of the Lord to appoint 12 pastors in his Church who would oversee 12 separate home Churches on Wednesday nights. They all still meet together on Sunday mornings to hear the main pastor teach, but these small groups also act as functioning Churches. These pastors of the small groups are perhaps not as well-trained or capable from a human perspective but this servant leader saw the heart of God to raise up brothers and sisters, to encourage and lead the body of Christ.",
