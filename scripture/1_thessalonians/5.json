This message speaks of 3 reasons why people stop praying. First, our journey and will are not in line with God. Second, unconfessed sin. And lastly, a wrong perception of what prayer is. Prayer is simply knowing the mind of God and moving forward in faith with Him. We can come boldly with an honest heart and agree with what He has spoken to us until He brings it to pass.",
