He offers a balanced view on how to determine what soulishness is, and says that we must learn to allow the sword of the spirit to divide that which is of the soul from that which is of the Spirit, in order that we may fly out of this snare.",

            "description": "March 8, 2009 - Those who have a lustful pursuit of God and affections for the world will not see the coming of Christ. The future of the true church of Jesus Christ will have a heavenly vision. Who then is the faithful and wise servant? The servant who is one in heart and one with the purposes of God. The wise servant will have their hands stretched out to heal and touch those around them with the supernatural power that can come only by God's Spirit. Those that will have spiritual sight in the last days will have a willingness to be sent by God as a vessel to be poured out and broken for lost humanity.",
