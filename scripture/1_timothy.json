            "description": "Paul Washer is explaining what an assembly should look for in a Godly pastor. Will the man point things out that need dealing with? Is he a servant of Jesus Christ, as well as of the sheep? What is his relationship with the word of God for himself ? Is his teaching balanced, not just majoring on his favourite topics? Does he work hard? How does he discipline himself for the purpose of Godliness? Don\u2019t be persuaded just by a pleasant personality, Mr Washer warns. (29 minutes)",

The hardest part of faith is the last half hour and just before the victory we give up turning away from God with a evil heart of unbelief. God will lead us into places where we are shut up and nothing short of a miracle will get us out of the situation. It is in these places of hopeless crisis that God will come through to glorify His name. We must stand on the promises of God with a heart full of faith declaring that God is faithful. Pastor Wilkerson examines the lives of Saul, Solomon and Samson as men of God who went into a crises of faith and failed the test. Our faith will be tried, as by fire. If your faith is being tested, you should listen carefully to this message.",

There is a great need for glorifying God in all things including the scriptures of God. There needs to be a re-capturing of this urgency to understand spiritual doctrine no matter what theological persuasion we come from, we must meet at the general powerful truths of the Scripture.",

Today there is error on every side; it's not only pervasive but it's subtle and it's damning.

Persist in this, for by so doing you will save both yourself and your hearers\". If only more pastors today would heed the Apostle's advice.",

He speaks of the work of the Holy Spirit in the believer and not simply a holding to doctrinal viewpoints but the life of God through us, His power. God manifests His purpose through believers to see His salvation reach others. He shares that our experience of power with God is not a selfish personal experience but for God's greater purpose. Lastly he ties in the Gospel and shares that this is God's ultimate larger picture beyond our own personal experiences for ourselves.",

He gives a strong exhortation about the abuse of seeking lustfully money for personal gain amongst the Churches. He clearly shows how many leaders are seeking comfort and gain in the ministry. There needs to be a change in North America the way we use money for the glory of God.",
