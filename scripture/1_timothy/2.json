While Luther was abscent from his church in Wittenberg he was replaced by his co-pastor who was zealous for reform and implimented the ordinances he read about in the Bible, such as communion.  When Luther returned he rebuked his co-pastor who was only following in Luthers own steps but a bit to energetically for Luther.  The Anabaptists were radical reformers who wanted to reform the quickly they read in the scriptures that the church was a called out peple and thus opposed the movemnts of the time that called for church and state to be united.",

It's tempting for women to want to give in to the world's pressure and wear what is fashionable and available. But modesty deals more with the heart than the body. In a Sunday message primarily directed toward women, C.J. Mahaney speaks from Scripture on the attitude, appearance, and allegiance of the modest woman.",
