While Luther was abscent from his church in Wittenberg he was replaced by his co-pastor who was zealous for reform and implimented the ordinances he read about in the Bible, such as communion.  When Luther returned he rebuked his co-pastor who was only following in Luthers own steps but a bit to energetically for Luther.  The Anabaptists were radical reformers who wanted to reform the quickly they read in the scriptures that the church was a called out peple and thus opposed the movemnts of the time that called for church and state to be united.",
