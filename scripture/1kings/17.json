Evangelical writer, theological teacher and founder of the Torchbearers bible schools. These schools are now world-wide in many countries and provide a teaching base on the person of Christ in the believer and basic Biblical exposition of Bible books.\r\n\r\nAmong the many books that he wrote, the most influential have been: \"The Saving Life Of Christ\" , \"The mystery of godliness\" and \"If I perish, I Perish.\" His burden in ministry was to express and show the indwelling life of Christ in believers and the rest and power that life will have in us as we trust and have faith.",
