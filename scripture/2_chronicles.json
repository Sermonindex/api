We will all die if the Lord does not return in our lifetime. But here, too, God protects. He protects us from unbelief, and preserves us for his heavenly kingdom.",

Among other things, he discusses how revival is primarily aimed at the Church, as opposed to the lost. This is the only time I have heard Dr. Orr talk about his multiple PhD's; surely because he is asked in the interview. This interview displays the typical humility of this extremely knowledgeable and well-traveled individual who, though he is surely one of the foremost scholars on the subject of historic revival, offers correction to the modern church, but does so in a way that it is evident he is not trying to glorify himself. The late Dr. Orr expresses his desire in this interview to see revival again, and puts forth his opinion that he does not believe that future revival is reserved for the nation of Israel only.",

            "description": "Brother Edgar shares a strong word on the wicked ways in Christians life's. He specifically shares about ways we deny God's power for revival in our daily walks. In this part he speaks of the lack of witnessing for Christ that we as believers in the West are not sharing our faith freely and boldly as we should. May God show us the evil in this and it to be repented of and to walk in the freedom of the Holy Spirit to be a living witness, a salt of the earth and light to this lost generation.",

He was arrested because he was a Christian. When I went there I also had to meet in a forest like the believers had to at that time. Many Christians didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want to be in the government endorsed church. They were put on a train to northern Siberia where it is dark for six months. Many Christians died in northern Siberia from the cold. They threw him off the train so that he would die. It was very cold there and you can freeze to death. He fell into a very deep sleep. The cold caused him to want to sleep which is dangerous. Your brain can be frozen. When he woke up he said, \"What\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s happening? I feel warm.\" It was a bear from the forest. A bear is very dangerous. He found himself embraced by the bear. He said, \"Lord, you have sent a ferocious animal to help me.\" When he woke up, the bear also woke up. It ran off and returned with a packet. It had food and bread inside. He ate the bread that had butter and jam on it. He also gave some to the bear. What an amazing work of God!",

Campbell shared several practical \"principles that govern spiritual quickening.\"  The differences between a God-sent revival and the man-centered evangelistic means of his day are truly heart-searching for anyone engaged in work to save men's souls.  Since God's sovereignty does not nullify man's responsibility, Campbell admonished his hearers to be \"agents of revival\" that take God up on \"His covenant engagement\" in prayer and staying close to the heart of the Shepherd.",

He reluctantly took his glory from Israel as illustrated in Ezekiel, and nobody even noticed, for the priests were busy with their secret things. Whatever you give your time and attention to the most is what is influencing your character and is becoming your idol. Too many go to church, going through the motions on Sunday and the rest of the week devote themselves to their own pursuits and pleasures and wonder why they can't feel God's presence. God desires to dwell among his people. But when they don't like to retain the knowledge of God, when they prefer an appearance of godliness with no power it will lead to destruction.",

            "description": "The message by John Franklin  was about expectations if we repent .  He starts out with II Chronicles 6:36 . He says that we need to know how judgment functions and works and how to respond correctly.  He then goes to II Samuel 12:7  where Nathan confronts David.  David confesses - repents but it did not cancel the judgment.  John Franklin's expectations of the coming days is if we come to the place of revival, he believes we can be forgiven and restored to God, but it is too late to cancel our judgment.",

            "description": "This verse contains a challenge and a wonderful promise. God speaks directly to his people, not the gentiles but to the believers. \"If my people return to me and humble themselves, they will receive forgiveness of sin.\" God sees the sin and if people repent of their sin, God will heal their land. This text is an inspiration to every believer. The challenge is that the world is in our hands. If we repent and get right with God, our land will be healed and restored. We are not to point to the sin of other people but to ourselves and if we repent the Lord will heal our land. God requires that we humble ourselves. This word was said to Solomon where God said, \"If my people will humble themselves and turn from their wicked ways, I will heal the land.\" Things can be turned around if people have an ear to hear what God says.",
