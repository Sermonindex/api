This is the only time I have heard Dr. Orr talk about his multiple PhD's; surely because he is asked in the interview. This interview displays the typical humility of this extremely knowledgeable and well-traveled individual who, though he is surely one of the foremost scholars on the subject of historic revival, offers correction to the modern church, but does so in a way that it is evident he is not trying to glorify himself. The late Dr. Orr expresses his desire in this interview to see revival again, and puts forth his opinion that he does not believe that future revival is reserved for the nation of Israel only.",

His sacrificial commitment, farsightedness and aptitude to perceive helped him to lead a life of unhindered devotion to serve Christ and His church. K.P. Yohannan is also the voice of Athmeeya Yathra, touching millions through his daily radio and TV broadcasts. His 250 books offer practical and spiritual guidance on hundreds of subjects.",

For over 70 years, the church was blessed and challenged by the prophetic ministry of Vance Havner. His style and burden was prophetic similar to the ministry of A.W. Tozer calling the Church to revival. His influence extended to a national level, but Dr. Havner's approach was always to minister where God directed, regardless of the size of the church.  His appeal and influence transcended denominational lines, and he spoke to many different groups of people.\r\n\r\nThroughout his ministry, Vance Havner lived and preached that a Christian should should exhibit faithfulness to Jesus in all areas of life.  He taught that the Christian should attend to, \"the outliving of the inliving Christ.\"  Havner wrote, \"To some, Christianity is an argument.  To many, it is a performance.  To a few, it is an experience.\"",

Whatever you give your time and attention to the most is what is influencing your character and is becoming your idol. Too many go to church, going through the motions on Sunday and the rest of the week devote themselves to their own pursuits and pleasures and wonder why they can't feel God's presence.

It was spoken before a Campus Crusade for Christ fellowship or gathering. The many years of J. Edwin Orr's ministry and burden for revival really show through in this small sermon on the role of revival and prayer in God's awakening of the redeemed and saving of the lost.",

David confesses - repents but it did not cancel the judgment.  John Franklin's expectations of the coming days is if we come to the place of revival, he believes we can be forgiven and restored to God, but it is too late to cancel our judgment.",

God speaks directly to his people, not the gentiles but to the believers. \"If my people return to me and humble themselves, they will receive forgiveness of sin.\" God sees the sin and if people repent of their sin, God will heal their land. This text is an inspiration to every believer. The challenge is that the world is in our hands. If we repent and get right with God, our land will be healed and restored. We are not to point to the sin of other people but to ourselves and if we repent the Lord will heal our land. God requires that we humble ourselves. This word was said to Solomon where God said, \"If my people will humble themselves and turn from their wicked ways, I will heal the land.\" Things can be turned around if people have an ear to hear what God says.",
