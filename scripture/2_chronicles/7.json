Among other things, he discusses how revival is primarily aimed at the Church, as opposed to the lost. This is the only time I have heard Dr. Orr talk about his multiple PhD's; surely because he is asked in the interview. This interview displays the typical humility of this extremely knowledgeable and well-traveled individual who, though he is surely one of the foremost scholars on the subject of historic revival, offers correction to the modern church, but does so in a way that it is evident he is not trying to glorify himself. The late Dr. Orr expresses his desire in this interview to see revival again, and puts forth his opinion that he does not believe that future revival is reserved for the nation of Israel only.",

The cold caused him to want to sleep which is dangerous. Your brain can be frozen. When he woke up he said, \"What\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s happening? I feel warm.\" It was a bear from the forest. A bear is very dangerous. He found himself embraced by the bear. He said, \"Lord, you have sent a ferocious animal to help me.\" When he woke up, the bear also woke up.

            "description": "This verse contains a challenge and a wonderful promise. God speaks directly to his people, not the gentiles but to the believers. \"If my people return to me and humble themselves, they will receive forgiveness of sin.\" God sees the sin and if people repent of their sin, God will heal their land. This text is an inspiration to every believer. The challenge is that the world is in our hands. If we repent and get right with God, our land will be healed and restored. We are not to point to the sin of other people but to ourselves and if we repent the Lord will heal our land. God requires that we humble ourselves. This word was said to Solomon where God said, \"If my people will humble themselves and turn from their wicked ways, I will heal the land.\" Things can be turned around if people have an ear to hear what God says.",
