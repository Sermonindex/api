Rather, gathering in this way is a preferred Biblical approach, especially when the Church is under persecution. If it was important to have specific church buildings to represent God and spread the Gospel, would God not have commanded them in Scripture? Although we find detailed instructions for the tabernacle in the Old Testament122 we find quite a different emphasis in the New Testament.123 We see this truth prophetically spoken by Stephen just before he was martyred: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153However, the Most High does not live in houses made by human hands. As the prophet says: \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcHeaven is My throne, and the earth is My footstool. What kind of house will you build for Me? Says the Lord. Or where will My resting place be? Has not My hand made all these things?\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 You stiff-necked people! Your hearts and ears are still uncircumcised. You are just like your ancestors: You always resist the Holy Spirit!\u00e2\u20ac\u009d",

Over the past 50 years particularly originating in Western countries there have been such excesses and abuses of what is considered Spirit-filled Christianity that many true believers have been repulsed completely from even seeking the Lord for the true filling of the Spirit. This is not only a tragedy but one of Satan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tactics323 to hinder the growth of the true Church of Jesus Christ. The genuine believer should never feel scared to call out to God for fresh infusions of the Spirit of God for service324 and to foster a dependence on the Holy Spirit of God daily in his life.",

If we are weak, so was Paul; and if, like him, we are strong in our weakness, we shall be in the best of company. If the same things be seen in us which were wrought in the apostle of the Gentiles, we may join with him in glorying in infirmities, because the power of Christ doth rest upon us, and we may count ourselves happy that with such a saint we can cry, \u201cWhen I am weak, then am I strong.\u201d I. Perhaps I can expound the text best if I first TURN IT THE OTHER WAY UP, and use it as a warning. When I am strong, then am I weak.

Manley chose daily healing because for him it was an act of faith that each day the Lord had to heal him to the point that he could get out of bed.

Paul Washer begins his exhortations by dealing with the speculations (AV = \u2018imaginations\u2019) which must be cast down if we are to fulfil our calling to be a biblical people. He focuses on the roles of men in particular, both in their families and their local churches, which he shows to be the two hardest places to live out a Biblical manhood. Most problems in those two areas, he says, can be traced back to men not standing on truth and not acting Biblically. Working through specific examples, he shows how the speculations of men actually fight against God, and also shows how such things should be put right. He then focuses in some detail on marriage, using Romans 8:28. Once a man discovers the true purpose of marriage, and learns what it means to love his wife as Christ loves the church, he will find both joy and rest in putting an end to his former speculations about the nature of marriage.

We have this great kingdom which cannot be moved, such great victory, and power living in us. Pastor Conlon goes through many other scriptures revealing how the Lord Jesus Christ is our Treasure. The person drawing closer to Him, cannot help being awed by Him, and at the same time painfully aware of their own sinful flesh in comparison. If your heart is toward Christ he knows, and he will not let the enemy overwhelm you as you trust in him. Pursuit of an ever increasing knowledge and intimacy with Christ should be the Christian's number one priority. When we get careless with the word of God and prayer, tragedy can come.

We pray that he will be honored and the Lord glorified by this attempt to share this legacy with all who would live a life of faith that is truly pleasing to God.\r\nThere came a time when Manley believed the Lord gave him a choice of complete healing or daily healing. Manley chose daily healing because for him it was an act of faith that each day the Lord had to heal him to the point that he could get out of bed. During those years there were more confinements in the hospital, as well as trips to Europe and revivals all over the United States. He led Bible Conferences, revivals, and shared his personal testimony with others dealing with illness.",

It is within our psycho-space that we must fill our \u201cminds\u201d with this mind of Christ, which is full of love, joy, peace, patience, and the fruit of the Spirit, as we follow the Spirit, the logos of God step-wise begins to conform us into the likeness of the logos of Christ.

The evangelical organization Desiring God is named for his book Desiring God: Meditations of a Christian Hedonist (1986).\r\n\r\nIn 1980, after what he described as an \"irresistible call of the Lord to preach\", Piper became Pastor of Bethlehem Baptist Church in Minneapolis, Minnesota, where he has been ministering ever since. Piper hit the evangelical scene after the publication of his book Desiring God: Meditations of a Christian Hedonist (1986) and has continued to publish dozens of other books further articulating this theological perspective. In 1994, he founded Desiring God Ministries, which provides all of Piper's sermons and articles from the past three decades, and most of his books online free of charge, as well as offering for sale books, CDs, and DVDs and regularly hosting conferences.",

Many other things we might give thee warning of (gentle Reader) if we had not exceeded the measure of a Preface already. It remaineth, that we commend thee to God, and to the Spirit of his grace, which is able to build further than we can ask or think. He removeth the scales from our eyes, the vail from our hearts, opening our wits that we may understand his word, enlarging our hearts, yea correcting our affections, that we may love it to the end. Ye are brought unto fountains of living water which ye digged not; do not cast earth into them with the Philistines, neither prefer broken pits before them with the wicked Jews. [Gen 26:15. Jer 2:13.] Others have laboured, and you may enter into their labours; O receive not so great things in vain, O despise not so great salvation! Be not like swine to tread under foot so precious things, neither yet like dogs to tear and abuse holy things. Say not to our Saviour with the Gergesites, Depart out of our coast [Matt 8:34]; neither yet with Esau sell your birthright for a mess of pottage [Heb 12:16]. If light be come into the world, love not darkness more than light; if food, if clothing be offered, go not naked, starve not yourselves. Remember the advice of Nazianzene, \"It is a grievous thing\" (or dangerous) \"to neglect a great fair, and to seek to make markets afterwards:\" also the encouragement of S. Chrysostom, \"It is altogether impossible, that he that is sober\" (and watchful) \"should at any time be neglected:\" [S. Chrysost. in epist. ad Rom. cap. 14. oral. 26.]\r\nLastly, the admonition and menacing of S. Augustine, \"They that despise God's will inviting them, shall feel God's will taking vengeance of them.\" [S. August. ad artic. sibi falso object. Artic. 16.] It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God; [Heb 10:31] but a blessed thing it is, and will bring us to everlasting blessedness in the end, when God speaketh unto us, to hearken; when he setteth his word before us, to read it; when he stretcheth out his hand and calleth, to answer, Here am I, here we are to do thy will, O God. The Lord work a care and conscience in us to know him and serve him, that we may be acknowledged of him at the appearing of our Lord Jesus Christ, to whom with the holy Ghost, be all praise and thanksgiving. Amen.",

For over 70 years, the church was blessed and challenged by the prophetic ministry of Vance Havner. His style and burden was prophetic similar to the ministry of A.W. Tozer calling the Church to revival. His influence extended to a national level, but Dr. Havner's approach was always to minister where God directed, regardless of the size of the church.  His appeal and influence transcended denominational lines, and he spoke to many different groups of people.\r\n\r\nThroughout his ministry, Vance Havner lived and preached that a Christian should should exhibit faithfulness to Jesus in all areas of life.  He taught that the Christian should attend to, \"the outliving of the inliving Christ.\"  Havner wrote, \"To some, Christianity is an argument.  To many, it is a performance.  To a few, it is an experience.\"",
