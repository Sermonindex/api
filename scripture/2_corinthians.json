In the new covenant we have a better life of faith like Jesus, who overcame all sin and pleased the Father from morning until night.  The root causes of failure to walk by faith are in seeing faith as something in ourselves or working hard to obtain what only God can do.  Zac shares how he tried every doctrine of holiness and failed miserably until he came to see the simplicity of biblical faith--leaning of the human personality in total confidence in God's perfect love for me.",

Jesus would not have asked the Father to send us a Comforter he knew we wouldn't need. We need to know why he was sent, why he dwells in us, and allow him to do what the Father sent him to do.",

Have you allowed Him to transform and change your life? This is going to be the Real Jesus and it is unfortunate that we have to speak about that because God never intended that there should ever be any other Jesus presented to this world than the real one. Everything valuable has been counterfeited, people don't counterfeit things that are not valuable. Even in the times of the apostles we read of Jesus being counterfeited. So I want to turn first of all to 2 Corinthians chapter 11 so you'll see that it is not a problem of the 21st century. It was there right from the beginning.",

Over the past 50 years particularly originating in Western countries there have been such excesses and abuses of what is considered Spirit-filled Christianity that many true believers have been repulsed completely from even seeking the Lord for the true filling of the Spirit. This is not only a tragedy but one of Satan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tactics323 to hinder the growth of the true Church of Jesus Christ. The genuine believer should never feel scared to call out to God for fresh infusions of the Spirit of God for service324 and to foster a dependence on the Holy Spirit of God daily in his life.",

If we are weak, so was Paul; and if, like him, we are strong in our weakness, we shall be in the best of company. If the same things be seen in us which were wrought in the apostle of the Gentiles, we may join with him in glorying in infirmities, because the power of Christ doth rest upon us, and we may count ourselves happy that with such a saint we can cry, \u201cWhen I am weak, then am I strong.\u201d I. Perhaps I can expound the text best if I first TURN IT THE OTHER WAY UP, and use it as a warning. When I am strong, then am I weak.

If you have decided to cross the line of luke warmness and you are fully surrendered to the Lord's purposes you will become a target for satan. Nothing shakes the kingdom of hell more than a prayng Christian who is sold out for Jesus. When satan recognizes this fire in us he will attempt to torment our minds with evil thoughts of past failures and sin. His plan is to neutralize our spiritual fight. God is calling us to get our focus off our afflictions and sin and go back to the New Covenant and declare Jesus to be the Highest Authority than anything the devil can throw at us.",

Paul Washer begins his exhortations by dealing with the speculations (AV = \u2018imaginations\u2019) which must be cast down if we are to fulfil our calling to be a biblical people. He focuses on the roles of men in particular, both in their families and their local churches, which he shows to be the two hardest places to live out a Biblical manhood. Most problems in those two areas, he says, can be traced back to men not standing on truth and not acting Biblically. Working through specific examples, he shows how the speculations of men actually fight against God, and also shows how such things should be put right. He then focuses in some detail on marriage, using Romans 8:28. Once a man discovers the true purpose of marriage, and learns what it means to love his wife as Christ loves the church, he will find both joy and rest in putting an end to his former speculations about the nature of marriage.

And that presence will produce in a hungry soul an ever increasing revelation of who Christ is. This is often revealed in us and to us through suffering and trials. We have this great kingdom which cannot be moved, such great victory, and power living in us. Pastor Conlon goes through many other scriptures revealing how the Lord Jesus Christ is our Treasure. The person drawing closer to Him, cannot help being awed by Him, and at the same time painfully aware of their own sinful flesh in comparison. If your heart is toward Christ he knows, and he will not let the enemy overwhelm you as you trust in him. Pursuit of an ever increasing knowledge and intimacy with Christ should be the Christian's number one priority. When we get careless with the word of God and prayer, tragedy can come. The devil is always after the treasure of the presence of Christ in your life. Pastor Conlon warns: There is no greater danger than to become careless with this Book!",

            "description": "Glyn Owen beautifully and forcefully brings the text upon us 'For the Love of Christ Constraineth Us.' There is something not just in the words of this sermon but the spirit behind it that makes it effectual to the mind that hears it. Do we understand something of the experience of Paul the Apostle in this text? Are you constrained, compelled by God? Are you serving yourself or are you dead to yourself and serving the Living God?",

We can only faithfully represent him when we truly know him. If you are not actively, honestly seeking God, then you need to get down to business and ask him for the desire and hunger in your heart for him. He will give it to those who are sincere. And they will reap wonderful rewards of joy and peace in their God. We need to actively seek God, wanting his ways and thoughts over our own to become so intimate with him that we know his heart and share it. Then we will love what he loves and hate what he hates. Thinking as he things, walking together in agreement. This is what God wants with each of his children. For those who want a closer walk with the Lord, this is a must hear.",

This sermon shows how, if you use worldly methods to attract people to your fellowships, worldly people are all you will attract.  Brother Zac uses a flurry of scriptures to blow away any notion that it is acceptable to God to still be of this present evil world.",

Surely whatsoever the Christian can desire is to be found in those words \u201cAll things.\u201d But lest even that should not be comprehensive enough, our summary contains a still greater word, one which is supreme over all inasmuch as all things spring from his loins, and yet he remaineth still the same, as full as ever. \u201cAll things are of God.\u201d If we be thirsty, here are streams that never can be exhausted.

Animals, plants, humans, every living thing has what he acutely titles, \u201cpsycho-space.\u201d  The psycho space being the realm in which each living thing has the capacity for some degree of thought or communication.  He proceeds to explain that the logos of God is communicated fundamentally to man through his character.  We see the logos of God in how Jesus healed Malcus\u2019s ear, and how he endured such contradiction from rebel\u2019s and sinners.  It is within our psycho-space that we must fill our \u201cminds\u201d with this mind of Christ, which is full of love, joy, peace, patience, and the fruit of the Spirit, as we follow the Spirit, the logos of God step-wise begins to conform us into the likeness of the logos of Christ.  Smith also shares a great testimony how an SS Nazi officer was converted to the faith when he shared with him about the strength of Christ character.",

Yes, there certainly are many ways to hell but only one way to heaven. The ring the young man gives to his future bride is a token and promise that he will keep himself pure for her until the day of marriage; in receiving the ring, the girl makes the same promise. Young people should live like Mary the mother of Jesus. When the angel told her that she would bare a son, she replied, \u201cHow can this be, since I do not know a man?\u201d (Luke 1:34) She lived a holy and pure life as we read in 1Cor 7:34, \u201cThe unmarried woman cares about the things of the Lord, that she may be holy both in body and in spirit.\u201d",
