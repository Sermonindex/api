One revelation from God protected Abraham from the temptations from the king of Sodom.  Faith is hearing God's promise to you and \"amening\" that as Abraham did.",

This message encourages us that if Christ is in us we will never be overpowered by the voice or strategy of the devil. God will take you through before He takes you out. He will give you supernatural strength and your testimony will be Jesus took me through. Never give up because God is on your side!",
