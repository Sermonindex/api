Have you allowed Him to transform and change your life? This is going to be the Real Jesus and it is unfortunate that we have to speak about that because God never intended that there should ever be any other Jesus presented to this world than the real one. Everything valuable has been counterfeited, people don't counterfeit things that are not valuable. Even in the times of the apostles we read of Jesus being counterfeited. So I want to turn first of all to 2 Corinthians chapter 11 so you'll see that it is not a problem of the 21st century. It was there right from the beginning.",
