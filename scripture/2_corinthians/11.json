Have you allowed Him to transform and change your life? This is going to be the Real Jesus and it is unfortunate that we have to speak about that because God never intended that there should ever be any other Jesus presented to this world than the real one. Everything valuable has been counterfeited, people don't counterfeit things that are not valuable. Even in the times of the apostles we read of Jesus being counterfeited. So I want to turn first of all to 2 Corinthians chapter 11 so you'll see that it is not a problem of the 21st century. It was there right from the beginning.",

He shares on the sabbath rest and how God prescribed a rest so that God could be put first. In the same way in the New Covenant we are to give our first to the Lord amidst the distractions and allures of this world. One chief underlying factor of not seeking the Lord is greed for money and covetousness of which the children of Israel fell into time and time again instead of seeking the Lord first.",

It's an American cultural invention to appease the lifestyle of luxury and pleasure. Primarily a Caucasian, suburban gospel, it's also in our major cities and is sweeping the nation, influencing ministers of every denomination, and giving birth to megachurches with thousands who come to hear a nonconfronting message.",

The world gets engaged with a party, drinking and boozing, but we as Christians do it in God's house with prayer and in holiness. Some say that there are many ways to celebrate an engagement. Yes, there certainly are many ways to hell but only one way to heaven. The ring the young man gives to his future bride is a token and promise that he will keep himself pure for her until the day of marriage; in receiving the ring, the girl makes the same promise. Young people should live like Mary the mother of Jesus. When the angel told her that she would bare a son, she replied, \u201cHow can this be, since I do not know a man?\u201d (Luke 1:34) She lived a holy and pure life as we read in 1Cor 7:34, \u201cThe unmarried woman cares about the things of the Lord, that she may be holy both in body and in spirit.\u201d",
