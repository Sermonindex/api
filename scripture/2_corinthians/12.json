            "description": "The expression is paradoxical, and seems somewhat singular; yet it was the experience of the apostle Paul, a man of calm spirit, by no means fanciful, a wise man, and far removed from a fanatic. It was the experience of one who was led of the Spirit of God, and therefore it was a gracious experience: the experience of one who was a father in Israel, who could safely bid us to be imitators of him, even as he imitated the Lord Jesus Christ; and therefore it was a safe experience. If we are weak, so was Paul; and if, like him, we are strong in our weakness, we shall be in the best of company. If the same things be seen in us which were wrought in the apostle of the Gentiles, we may join with him in glorying in infirmities, because the power of Christ doth rest upon us, and we may count ourselves happy that with such a saint we can cry, \u201cWhen I am weak, then am I strong.\u201d I. Perhaps I can expound the text best if I first TURN IT THE OTHER WAY UP, and use it as a warning. When I am strong, then am I weak. Perhaps, while thinking of the text thus turned inside out, we shall be getting light upon it to be used when we view it with the right side outwards, and see that when we are weak, then we are strong. I am quite sure that some people think themselves very strong, and are not so...",

If you have decided to cross the line of luke warmness and you are fully surrendered to the Lord's purposes you will become a target for satan. Nothing shakes the kingdom of hell more than a prayng Christian who is sold out for Jesus. When satan recognizes this fire in us he will attempt to torment our minds with evil thoughts of past failures and sin. His plan is to neutralize our spiritual fight. God is calling us to get our focus off our afflictions and sin and go back to the New Covenant and declare Jesus to be the Highest Authority than anything the devil can throw at us.",
