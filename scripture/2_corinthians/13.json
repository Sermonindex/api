It is much more simple than most think, yet much more vital to allow this communion, even hungrily seek it, than we realize. Jesus would not have asked the Father to send us a Comforter he knew we wouldn't need. We need to know why he was sent, why he dwells in us, and allow him to do what the Father sent him to do.",
