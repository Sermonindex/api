All God has called you to do is to live before Him, and He will see to it that His fragrance permeates our family members and the lost world around us.",

Sadly modern Christendom has been overwhelmed with the salesman who sells Christ as ware and treats the holy things as a way to profit financially.150 It does not take much discernment for the worldly person to see the counterfeit preacher on TV who makes money look like their god.151 Yet, sadly, believers who are asleep spiritually, and have not been seeking the Lord, are given over to this delusion which is coming upon them in masses.152 False teachers abound and the saints are sleeping. There needs to be a clarion cry across all nations that God is not for sale and is against those who love money and equate righteousness with financial gain and profit.",

Over the past 50 years particularly originating in Western countries there have been such excesses and abuses of what is considered Spirit-filled Christianity that many true believers have been repulsed completely from even seeking the Lord for the true filling of the Spirit. This is not only a tragedy but one of Satan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tactics323 to hinder the growth of the true Church of Jesus Christ. The genuine believer should never feel scared to call out to God for fresh infusions of the Spirit of God for service324 and to foster a dependence on the Holy Spirit of God daily in his life.",
