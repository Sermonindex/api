Rather, gathering in this way is a preferred Biblical approach, especially when the Church is under persecution. If it was important to have specific church buildings to represent God and spread the Gospel, would God not have commanded them in Scripture? Although we find detailed instructions for the tabernacle in the Old Testament122 we find quite a different emphasis in the New Testament.123 We see this truth prophetically spoken by Stephen just before he was martyred: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153However, the Most High does not live in houses made by human hands. As the prophet says: \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcHeaven is My throne, and the earth is My footstool. What kind of house will you build for Me? Says the Lord. Or where will My resting place be? Has not My hand made all these things?\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 You stiff-necked people! Your hearts and ears are still uncircumcised. You are just like your ancestors: You always resist the Holy Spirit!\u00e2\u20ac\u009d",

If you are not actively, honestly seeking God, then you need to get down to business and ask him for the desire and hunger in your heart for him. He will give it to those who are sincere. And they will reap wonderful rewards of joy and peace in their God. We need to actively seek God, wanting his ways and thoughts over our own to become so intimate with him that we know his heart and share it. Then we will love what he loves and hate what he hates. Thinking as he things, walking together in agreement. This is what God wants with each of his children. For those who want a closer walk with the Lord, this is a must hear.",

He proceeds to explain that the logos of God is communicated fundamentally to man through his character.  We see the logos of God in how Jesus healed Malcus\u2019s ear, and how he endured such contradiction from rebel\u2019s and sinners.  It is within our psycho-space that we must fill our \u201cminds\u201d with this mind of Christ, which is full of love, joy, peace, patience, and the fruit of the Spirit, as we follow the Spirit, the logos of God step-wise begins to conform us into the likeness of the logos of Christ.
