And that presence will produce in a hungry soul an ever increasing revelation of who Christ is. This is often revealed in us and to us through suffering and trials. We have this great kingdom which cannot be moved, such great victory, and power living in us. Pastor Conlon goes through many other scriptures revealing how the Lord Jesus Christ is our Treasure. The person drawing closer to Him, cannot help being awed by Him, and at the same time painfully aware of their own sinful flesh in comparison. If your heart is toward Christ he knows, and he will not let the enemy overwhelm you as you trust in him. Pursuit of an ever increasing knowledge and intimacy with Christ should be the Christian's number one priority. When we get careless with the word of God and prayer, tragedy can come. The devil is always after the treasure of the presence of Christ in your life. Pastor Conlon warns: There is no greater danger than to become careless with this Book!",

Bill Mcleod was the pastor of Ebenezer Baptist Church for many years where ultimately God sent revival to that affecting much of Canada. He had a passion to know God and His word. Paul Washer said he was one of the most godly men he met in Canada.\r\n\r\nBill Mcleod had been praying and had his congregation praying for revival for years. On, October 17, 1971, God in His sovereignty came in revival. Without human means or explanation, the revival spread from church to church, community to community, city to city, and not long after from province to province. This has become known as the 1971 Canadian Revival movement.",
