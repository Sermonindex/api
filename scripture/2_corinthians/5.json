In the new covenant we have a better life of faith like Jesus, who overcame all sin and pleased the Father from morning until night.  The root causes of failure to walk by faith are in seeing faith as something in ourselves or working hard to obtain what only God can do.  Zac shares how he tried every doctrine of holiness and failed miserably until he came to see the simplicity of biblical faith--leaning of the human personality in total confidence in God's perfect love for me.",

Surely whatsoever the Christian can desire is to be found in those words \u201cAll things.\u201d But lest even that should not be comprehensive enough, our summary contains a still greater word, one which is supreme over all inasmuch as all things spring from his loins, and yet he remaineth still the same, as full as ever. \u201cAll things are of God.\u201d If we be thirsty, here are streams that never can be exhausted.

Jesus will come and burn in us with a fiery jealousy; He will consume everything that is not like Him. This fire is an inner passion born of the life of Christ within us. It\u2019s a fire that is always gathering and burning that which does not conform to the image of Christ within us. Jesus will try our works everyday by fire constantly changing and challenging and taking those things that are unlike Him and burning them in the fire of His passionate love for us.",
