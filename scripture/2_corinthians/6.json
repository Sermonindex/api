Brother Denny shares how parents who diligently apply themselves in training the body and soul of their children do them such a favor and give them a headstart when the Spirit of God does come to indwell them.",

He shared how God dealt with his heart that he had received the grace of God as a gift through the Father, Son and Holy Spirit as well as the saints who have gone before.  He pleads with the church to wake up and stop playing church games, for souls are in the balance for their day of salvation.",
