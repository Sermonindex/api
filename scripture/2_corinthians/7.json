Grace is being presented, he says, as an excuse to live however we want, yet still receive eternal life and blessing from God. He asserts that, as Psalm 18 says, God will reward us according to our righteousness. Rather than grace being an excuse for unrighteous behavior, it is the very power and ability to live righteously.",
