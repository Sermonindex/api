God is able to create and do visible and obvious miracles; God did not just attribute miracles to the apostolic period of time. The stories and miracles of Elijah are an inspiration and truly should test our faith. If we do not have the gift of miracles we have been led in an more excellent way in the teaching of the Word of God and in the spirit of Jesus Christ. Where is the God of Elijah? He is still the same and has not changed. But our way of living has definitely changed and we need to come to the place because the question that needs to be asked where are the Elijah\u2019s of God? Modern society and all of its convineces hinder the ability to know and meditate on God how Elijah did.",

God called brother Zac Poonen to a new work early on in his Christian experience. The movement is now called Christian Fellowship Churches where the New Covenant of New Testament Christianity is clearly preached. \r\n\r\nBrother Zac Poonen has written 25 books most of them being on the deeper Christian life. Many of these have been translated into a number of languages and have been circulated widely around the world. He clearly and passionately shares the  narrow way of Christian discipleship that is neglected by so many modern preachers.",

We pray that he will be honored and the Lord glorified by this attempt to share this legacy with all who would live a life of faith that is truly pleasing to God.\r\nThere came a time when Manley believed the Lord gave him a choice of complete healing or daily healing. Manley chose daily healing because for him it was an act of faith that each day the Lord had to heal him to the point that he could get out of bed. During those years there were more confinements in the hospital, as well as trips to Europe and revivals all over the United States. He led Bible Conferences, revivals, and shared his personal testimony with others dealing with illness.",

Was a preacher born in Bangor, County Down, Ireland. Nicknamed \"the Tornado of the Pulpit\", Nicholson spent his early years on his father's cargo ship. He began to preach Christianity in 1899 at the age of 23 and was known for his \"men-only\" meetings. Nicholson used straightforward language which communicated to the common man.\r\n\"Nicholson used to say that when a mission was begun it was not long before they had either a riot or revival. Sometimes we had more riot than revival, but never a revival without a riot.\" Nicholson wielded the Sword of the Spirit with a fury. His hearers were always affected one way or another. Some through his preaching were brought to humble repentance, while others resisted God's Word with indignation. Two favorite themes of Nicholson were \"God's love\" and \"God's hell.\" W. P. Nicholson always preached the love of God with all the warmth and tenderness he could muster; but for those who rejected this Good News, he offered the only alternative, GOD'S HELL. He preached on every aspect of hell with such zeal and passion that his hearers claimed to be able to almost smell the burning sulphur. Still others, under deep conviction and anxiety, dripped with sweat and unconsciously shredded the hymn books they held in their laps. Through this kind of fervent preaching, God brought entire communities face to face with the question, \"What shall I do with Jesus?\" One elderly man who had recollections of the Ulster Revival of 1859 said that some of the effects of Nicholson's meetings even exceeded what happened in '59. Another commentator on Nicholson's work said that he had seen nothing like it since the days of D. L. Moody.",

            "description": "Elisha's weeping in the face of Hazael is an action sermon for us to observe that the man of God feels what he preaches. The gospel message is more than theory or a package to deliver and be gone. Elisha shows us that tears are needed to minister to the souls of men. He is one of many examples of faithful servants of God whose hearts were broken with the urgency to reach perishing souls. In this sermon, a number of Biblical examples are given starting with Elisha. The need for this brokenness is vindicated in the fulfillment of Elisha's prophecy regarding Hazael's reign of terror against Israel. Reasons are also given why God demands brokenness from His servants to deliver His message of grace to deliver souls. The missing element in the modern day evangelical church shows how the church can move from a ministry of power to mere trite conformity to creeds and formalism. This needs to be repented of.",

A spiritual crisis during this period\u2014as he described two decades later in what is probably his best-known recorded teaching, \"Ten Shekels and a Shirt\"--left Reidhead with the conviction that much of evangelicalism had adopted utilitarian and humanistic philosophies contradictory to Biblical teaching.

This theme would recur throughout his later teaching.\r\n\r\nSince Mr. Reidhead's death in 1992, Bible Teaching Ministries, Inc. continues under the leadership of his wife, Marjorie, and daughter, Virginia Teitt, a dedicated Board, and the many people who have donated time and talent after being changed by God\u2019s Word through this message.
