God is able to create and do visible and obvious miracles; God did not just attribute miracles to the apostolic period of time. The stories and miracles of Elijah are an inspiration and truly should test our faith. If we do not have the gift of miracles we have been led in an more excellent way in the teaching of the Word of God and in the spirit of Jesus Christ. Where is the God of Elijah? He is still the same and has not changed. But our way of living has definitely changed and we need to come to the place because the question that needs to be asked where are the Elijah\u2019s of God? Modern society and all of its convineces hinder the ability to know and meditate on God how Elijah did.",

Your motive for coming up to this assembly should be to hear the gospel, and to discover the remedy by which your spiritual disease may be removed. But what, let me ask, are really the thoughts that occupy your minds? I can suppose that you are looking for different things from me. One, perhaps, imagines that something will be said odd and strange that shall provoke a smile: another imagines that I shall labor to make some display of elocution and speak tender words softly, like flakes of featherd snow melting as they fall, and so draw forth the silent, graceful tear. When both of these are alike disappointed, you will probably say to yourselves, \u201cWell, it is only the old story we used to hear when we went to the Sunday-school; it is just what we have listened to Sunday after Sunday, till we turn away surfeited with it.

Brother Duncan powerfully illustrates a spirit of inquiry and an acknowledgement of need in the Arnol revival \"when the farmhouse shook\".  \"The digging may involve a cost,\" he challenged, a self-denial of forgetting oneself \"in a desire to prepare the way for God.\"",

Here in 2 Kings 6 we find the people of God busy working. Suddenly an important part of the work, the axehead, is lost, and trees cannot be cut down without an axehead, the work grinds to a halt.  This is a figure of how the work of God cannot go on without all the parts being in place, and how to recover when sopmething is lost.  The young man cries to his master and so should we in time of struggle when we have lost something that hinders the work of the Lord only the Lord can replace it.",

Before God can use us and pour His provision through us He must see a core value in our character. We must have the same compassion that Christ has for us. True compassion is born of the Spirit.

            "description": "Elisha's weeping in the face of Hazael is an action sermon for us to observe that the man of God feels what he preaches. The gospel message is more than theory or a package to deliver and be gone. Elisha shows us that tears are needed to minister to the souls of men. He is one of many examples of faithful servants of God whose hearts were broken with the urgency to reach perishing souls. In this sermon, a number of Biblical examples are given starting with Elisha. The need for this brokenness is vindicated in the fulfillment of Elisha's prophecy regarding Hazael's reign of terror against Israel. Reasons are also given why God demands brokenness from His servants to deliver His message of grace to deliver souls. The missing element in the modern day evangelical church shows how the church can move from a ministry of power to mere trite conformity to creeds and formalism. This needs to be repented of.",
