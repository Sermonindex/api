            "description": "Jezebel introduced the children of Israel into Baal worship, so Israel was in the state of an spiritual apostasy.  God is able to create and do visible and obvious miracles; God did not just attribute miracles to the apostolic period of time. The stories and miracles of Elijah are an inspiration and truly should test our faith. If we do not have the gift of miracles we have been led in an more excellent way in the teaching of the Word of God and in the spirit of Jesus Christ. Where is the God of Elijah? He is still the same and has not changed. But our way of living has definitely changed and we need to come to the place because the question that needs to be asked where are the Elijah\u2019s of God? Modern society and all of its convineces hinder the ability to know and meditate on God how Elijah did.",
