But are we prepared to live the spiritual life afterward, or will we die a second time (the spiritual death of the unredeemed and the wicked). When Isaiah told King Hezikaiah that he must die soon and to get his \"house\" in order, the prophet was speaking to all of us. Death can come suddenly and unexpectedly. Are we prepared to meet God at any moment?",
