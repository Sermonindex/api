The sermon is alive with vivid revival accounts, as with its sister sermon, \"Lacking One Thing\".",

We are still commanded to stop up the wells of the enemy and old nature, and by asking the Holy Spirit to show us each one and lead us through the enemy territory in our own minds, to stop up each one. God will give you strength to not make peace with these things he will lead you to each area where the enemy has gained a foothold and sends out streams of lies to hinder you or lead you differently than the Lord wants you to go and take authority over them and stop them up. Wonderful message of deliverance from torment of the mind.",

            "description": "Campbell extracts principles for revival from 2 Kings 3 where the lack of water refers to the one thing that would ensure victory: the power of the Holy Ghost.  The three main points were 1) the futility of mere human effort, 2) faith that wins through, and 3) the fulness that met the need.  Brother Duncan powerfully illustrates a spirit of inquiry and an acknowledgement of need in the Arnol revival \"when the farmhouse shook\".  \"The digging may involve a cost,\" he challenged, a self-denial of forgetting oneself \"in a desire to prepare the way for God.\"",
