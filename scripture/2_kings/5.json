There are before me in this house, I fear, many who are spiritually diseased. Your motive for coming up to this assembly should be to hear the gospel, and to discover the remedy by which your spiritual disease may be removed. But what, let me ask, are really the thoughts that occupy your minds? I can suppose that you are looking for different things from me. One, perhaps, imagines that something will be said odd and strange that shall provoke a smile: another imagines that I shall labor to make some display of elocution and speak tender words softly, like flakes of featherd snow melting as they fall, and so draw forth the silent, graceful tear. When both of these are alike disappointed, you will probably say to yourselves, \u201cWell, it is only the old story we used to hear when we went to the Sunday-school; it is just what we have listened to Sunday after Sunday, till we turn away surfeited with it. It is, believe in Jesus Christ and live; there is nothing fresh or new to stimulate our intellect; nothing original to whet our curiosity...",

Smithers forcefully presents some of the roots and routes to a hard heart as well as the steps needed to return to a broken heart.",

Brother Ed squeezes out a number of precious truths from the accounts of the cleansing of Naaman the leper, the floating axe head, the opening the eyes of the servant, and the restoration of the widow's inheritance with a particular view of Elisha and what that means for us.",
