            "description": "This message was delivered at Bob Jones Univeristy and begins with hymns sung by some of the girls who were saved while in Lester Rolofs homes for young people. Here in 2 Kings 6 we find the people of God busy working. Suddenly an important part of the work, the axehead, is lost, and trees cannot be cut down without an axehead, the work grinds to a halt.  This is a figure of how the work of God cannot go on without all the parts being in place, and how to recover when sopmething is lost.  The young man cries to his master and so should we in time of struggle when we have lost something that hinders the work of the Lord only the Lord can replace it.",

            "description": "December 13, 2009 - God chooses an incredible strategy to release His provision. God will feed His people and then use the people He feeds to feed others. Before God can use us and pour His provision through us He must see a core value in our character. We must have the same compassion that Christ has for us. True compassion is born of the Spirit. The storehouse of God is unlocked when the Holy Spirit stirs us to reach out to the sea of human need all around us.",
