We must take a position of faith in Jesus Christ , fully determined to lay all our burdens at His feet and leave them there. The message of the Church of Jesus Christ in times of calamities such as these is a people That will choose to take a position in faith and offer hope to the hopeless.",

Grace is being presented, he says, as an excuse to live however we want, yet still receive eternal life and blessing from God. He asserts that, as Psalm 18 says, God will reward us according to our righteousness. Rather than grace being an excuse for unrighteous behavior, it is the very power and ability to live righteously.",

            "description": "THERE are very narrow limits to our knowledge. There is a great breadth to our conceit; but the things that we really know are very few, after all. He who is wisest will be the first to confess his own ignorance. Our faith in the superior knowledge of God is a great source of comfort to us. That he knows everything, is a sort of omnipresent covering to our naked ignorance. Though we know not as yet, we rejoice that he knows, and it is better that he should know than that we should know. Knowledge is safer in the hands of God than it would be in our hands. The infinite God alone is to be trusted with infinite knowledge. The first words of our text, \u201cThe Lord knoweth,\u201d often come as a comfort to my own mind. The text says, \u201cThe Lord knoweth how to deliver the godly out of temptations.\u201d This is only one of the many things, which the Lord knoweth. For instance, sometimes we meet with perplexing doctrines; perhaps we endeavor to effect reconciliation between the predestination of God and the freedom of human action. It is better not to wade too far into those deep waters, lest we lose ourselves in an abyss. \u201cThe Lord knoweth.\u201d",
