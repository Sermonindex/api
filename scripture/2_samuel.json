            "description": "This is one of the saddest chapters in the whole of the Old Testament.  David again sent his army out to do battle without going with them himself, and while they were away David took a strole one afternoon on the balcony of his palace.  He probably had no idea thet Bathsheba would be washing herself at that time and yet when he saw her he was transfixed, he had for years indulged in this forbidden passion in marrying more than one wife and that had laid the groundwork for what was about to take place.  He asked his servants who this woman was only to be told that not only was she the daughter and granddaughter of some of Davids closest advisers, but was also married to one of the mighty men in Davids army.  So he knew that her husband was away and thought he could get away with adultery, so they had a 'one night stand' but Bathsheba became pregnant.",

David loved the Lord so much that he wanted to give more to the Lord than the Lord asked of him, the Lord told David that he would be the father of the men who would build His house, the first would Solomon who built the temple in Jerusalem, but the second Son of David would build a house for God that would last forever, and this is of course the Lord Jesus, Who is at this time building His church.

Amnon was used to getting everything he wanted, and he wanted Tamar his sister, so much that he became lovesick over her.  So Amnon was advised of a plan to get alone with Tamar, he pretended to be sick and asked the king to send his sister Tamar to serve him whilst he was ill, David of course sent her.  But when she arrived Amnon took her into the bedroom demanded everyone leave and then raped her, giving in totally to his lust.  Tamar was devestated by this as after he had done this wicked act he wanted nothing more to do with her.  Tamar left and went to the house of Absalom her brother who found out what had happened.  David too found out but didn't chastise his son Amnon.  From that day on Absalom hated Amnon, and waited 2 whole years before inviting him to a feast and having hiom killed for what he had done.",

When Abner comes to him David asks for Michal, his first wife, to be returned to him, so Abner went and took Michal from where she was and brought her back to David.  Abner then went aroung Israel declaring that everyone should recognise David as being the rightful king and there was peace, but only for a short time.  Joab, Davids military commander, returns from a campaign to hear that Abner, who had killed Joabs brother Asahel on the field of battle, has made peace with David.  So he requests to see Abner and when he came Joab killed him, because of his brother, but when David heard about this he was greatly saddened and condemned Joab and all his house for this.",

But Joab, David's chief general was suspicious of Absalom and wanted him back in Jerusalem so he could keepa close eye on him.  Joab got a woman to come before David and pretend to be a poor widow and tell him a story that was almost exactly the sameas the situation the king was in with Absalom.  So after hearing the story David deicdes  to pardon the womans son who was in the place of Absalom, at this the woman confronts David as to why he has suspended justice for her son but not for his own.  In this is a great lesson that we should be forgiving of those who have personally wronged us.  But the justice of the Lord towards mankind was not suspended for the sake of reconcilliation as our punishment was laid upon the shoulder of the Lord Jesus when He was on the cross, thus justice was satisfied and not suspended.",

So he turned the hearts of the people back to him as if they were one person and it was only at this that David returned to the throne.  The first person to meet him at his return was the repentant Shimei who had cursed David and throne rocks at him when he was fleeing from Jerusalem. But now Shimei begged Davids forgiveness for what he had done, and David mercifully granted him a pardon.  The Mephibosheth came to David and told him of how Ziba had tricked him and lied to David about him, David told Mephibosheth that he copuld divide the land with Ziba but Mephibosheth only wanted to be with his king he wasn't interested in the land.

David asked Uriah how the battle was going and told him to go home and relax with his wife, but Uriah was a man of great integrity and refused to go home to be comfortable with his wife while Israel was at war.  So David sent him back to the front with a note for Joab his commander to place Uriah in the heat of the battle and withdraw from him, sentencing Uriah to death.  Joab obeyed the command of David and Uriah was killed in battle, David later took Bathsheba to be his wife in order to cover up what he had done but this displeased the Lord.  David had ignored the warnings of the Lord and temptation had turned to lust, lust to adultery, adultery to deception and finally into murder, this is how our sin if unchecked can uncontollably accumulate until it utterly blinds us and only the Lord can save us.",

Absalom followed this advice.  Ahithophel, who hated David due to the fact that he was Bathsehba's grandfather, then asked Absalom if he could lead a band of men immediately and go after David and kill him, this was a brilliant plan and had it not been for the intervention of the Lord would surely have meant the end of David.  Amazingly though Absaom asked for a second oppinion from Hushai the Archite, he appealed to Absalom's vanity and advised him to amass a great army and lead them out to battle, thus buying the king time, Absalom agreed with Hushai's plan and Ahithophel knowing it would lead to ruin returned home and hanged himself as he knew David would succeed and come after him.",

This is a testament to how fallen man will rebel against God-ordained authority at every opurtunity he can get.  So David aksed his new chief general Amasa to amas an army in three days and pursue Sheba, but Amasa had trouble amasing the army so David sent Abishai and the palace guard with Joab to pursue Sheba.  As they were pursuing Amasa caught up with them but Joab killed him, probably due to Amasa being Absaloms chief commander when he was alive.  So the guards carried on and came to the city of Abel where Sheba now was thinking himself to be safe. Joab and all the men laid seige to the city, but a wise woman from the city asked Joab why he was laying seige to the city, JOab told her tha he would leave once he knew Sheba was dead so she consulted the people of the city and they killed Sheba and threw his head over the wall and Joab and the army returned to Jerusalem.",

But he showed David the crown and bracelet that he had taken from Saul after his death, David was very grieved to hear the news and wrote a lamentation about Saul and Jonathan, this shows how David was free from the bitterness that would have ensnared his heart had he dwelt upon how Saul had wronged him. But David asks the Amalekite why he was not afraid to kill the anointed king of Israel and when the he didn't answer David had him killed for boasting over the dead.",

They took his head and went to David to show him how they had kiled his 'enemy' and sought a reward from him.  But David was sickened by what they had done and because of the evil in their hearts, so he rebuked them for killin Ishbosheth, calling Saul 'David's enemy' and claiming they had carried out the will of the Lord. But David did not consider Saul his enemy so he commanded that the two assains should be killed, as a statement that no one should attack the house of Saul anymore.  David then went and took the head of Ishbosheth and buried it with Abner.  This showed how David was a man after the heart of the Lord as he forgave his enemies and even loved them.",

It was highly likely that the famine and the war would not have touched David directly so he chose the punishment of the plague.  Famine and war would also have meant that he would have to rely on man for help but he chose to fall into the hands of the Lord as His mercy is great.  In the plague which lasted 3 days 70,000 people died but thatnks to the mercy of God the plague was stopped when the Angel of the Lord was at the threshing floor of  Araunah the Jebusite.  David bought the threshing floor and errected an altar on it as the Lord commanded, this was the same land where Abraham offered Isaac, Solomon built the temple and the Lord Jesus bled and died for us.",

David was recognised as a great ruler by the surrounding nations and they sent skilled craftsmen to work for him.  But during this time of great success David took more wives and concubines to himself which would lead to great problems later.  The Philistines then came and invaded Israel, so David enquired of the Lord what he should do and the Lord told him to meet them head on, so David won a great victory.

So David met with the Gibeonites and asked them how this could be put right, the Gibeonites asked for 7 men from the house of Saul that they might execute them.  David agreed and delivered to them 7 men whom the Gibeonites hung together to show they were accursed of God.  But the mother of 2 of the men would not allow their bodies to be desecrated by being eaten by the wild animals, so she kept a vigil over them until the rains came and she knew that their deaths had not been in vain.",

Chapter 22 is a psalm of David written at the end of his life much like Psalm 18, here we can see Davids heart overflowing with adoration and praise to God, he exaults the Lord with magestic title after magestic title, my Rock, my Fortress, my Deliverer... He priases God for His protection and how He would not allow David to be distressed and called all of creation to he him, for he knew that He delighted in him.  Even though he had sinned greatly in his life, David knew that the Lord had put away and forgiven his sin, and that before the Lord he was righteous because of God's great mercy.",

David send for Mephibosheth anyway, and he must have been terrified that David would kill him as he had been in hiding for years, but David did indeed show to him the kindness of God as he gave him back all Saul's land, said that he would not kill him, and told him that from that day on he would be welcome to eat at the table of the king.  This of course is a wonderful picture of our relationship to the Lord Jesus who has forgiven us, given us back more than we lost in Adam and invites us always to dine at His table, with Him.

To David God was the Goal not a Way to the goal as He so often is today.  David also had around him his mighty men who had first joined him in the cave of Adullam when they were weak afraid and in debt, but now the they were mighty through God, as they had learned to love the Lord and had gone out and won great victories.  In chapter 24 Satan tempted David to number all of Israel in order to see how strong he was in the natural but this was a thing which the Lord had expressly forbidden.",

Davids men who are with him ask for permission to kill Shimei but David is merciful towards him saying, that Absalom is what they should be concerned with and not the misguided insults of some distant relation of Saul, thus David again showed great mercy to the house of Saul and triumphed wonderfully in the face of adversity",

A spiritual crisis during this period\u2014as he described two decades later in what is probably his best-known recorded teaching, \"Ten Shekels and a Shirt\"--left Reidhead with the conviction that much of evangelicalism had adopted utilitarian and humanistic philosophies contradictory to Biblical teaching. The end of all being, he came to believe, was not the happiness of man, but the glorification of God. This theme would recur throughout his later teaching.\r\n\r\nSince Mr. Reidhead's death in 1992, Bible Teaching Ministries, Inc. continues under the leadership of his wife, Marjorie, and daughter, Virginia Teitt, a dedicated Board, and the many people who have donated time and talent after being changed by God\u2019s Word through this message.

He points out that the man who tried to steady the ark was not blaspheming God, he was not smashing it, or in any way intentionally rebelling against the Lord; but for all this, he was still disobediant and killed on the spot. \"A lady called me from the border of Mexico today...she was weeping, she said, '...oh, we do want to be such great soulwinners'...I said to her, my dear look, the first commandment is not, \"thou shalt be a soulwinner,\" the first commandment is, \"thou shalt love the Lord thy God...\"",
