            "description": "This is one of the saddest chapters in the whole of the Old Testament.  David again sent his army out to do battle without going with them himself, and while they were away David took a strole one afternoon on the balcony of his palace.  He probably had no idea thet Bathsheba would be washing herself at that time and yet when he saw her he was transfixed, he had for years indulged in this forbidden passion in marrying more than one wife and that had laid the groundwork for what was about to take place.  He asked his servants who this woman was only to be told that not only was she the daughter and granddaughter of some of Davids closest advisers, but was also married to one of the mighty men in Davids army.  So he knew that her husband was away and thought he could get away with adultery, so they had a 'one night stand' but Bathsheba became pregnant.",

David loved the Lord so much that he wanted to give more to the Lord than the Lord asked of him, the Lord told David that he would be the father of the men who would build His house, the first would Solomon who built the temple in Jerusalem, but the second Son of David would build a house for God that would last forever, and this is of course the Lord Jesus, Who is at this time building His church.  David humbled himself and blessed the Lord for his promises.  He accepted the promises of the Lord and asked only that the Lord would carry out His promises to build His house with his descendants.",

Amnon was used to getting everything he wanted, and he wanted Tamar his sister, so much that he became lovesick over her.  So Amnon was advised of a plan to get alone with Tamar, he pretended to be sick and asked the king to send his sister Tamar to serve him whilst he was ill, David of course sent her.  But when she arrived Amnon took her into the bedroom demanded everyone leave and then raped her, giving in totally to his lust.  Tamar was devestated by this as after he had done this wicked act he wanted nothing more to do with her.  Tamar left and went to the house of Absalom her brother who found out what had happened.  David too found out but didn't chastise his son Amnon.  From that day on Absalom hated Amnon, and waited 2 whole years before inviting him to a feast and having hiom killed for what he had done.",

When Abner comes to him David asks for Michal, his first wife, to be returned to him, so Abner went and took Michal from where she was and brought her back to David.  Abner then went aroung Israel declaring that everyone should recognise David as being the rightful king and there was peace, but only for a short time.  Joab, Davids military commander, returns from a campaign to hear that Abner, who had killed Joabs brother Asahel on the field of battle, has made peace with David.  So he requests to see Abner and when he came Joab killed him, because of his brother, but when David heard about this he was greatly saddened and condemned Joab and all his house for this.",

But Joab, David's chief general was suspicious of Absalom and wanted him back in Jerusalem so he could keepa close eye on him.  Joab got a woman to come before David and pretend to be a poor widow and tell him a story that was almost exactly the sameas the situation the king was in with Absalom.  So after hearing the story David deicdes  to pardon the womans son who was in the place of Absalom, at this the woman confronts David as to why he has suspended justice for her son but not for his own.  In this is a great lesson that we should be forgiving of those who have personally wronged us.  But the justice of the Lord towards mankind was not suspended for the sake of reconcilliation as our punishment was laid upon the shoulder of the Lord Jesus when He was on the cross, thus justice was satisfied and not suspended.",

So he turned the hearts of the people back to him as if they were one person and it was only at this that David returned to the throne.  The first person to meet him at his return was the repentant Shimei who had cursed David and throne rocks at him when he was fleeing from Jerusalem. But now Shimei begged Davids forgiveness for what he had done, and David mercifully granted him a pardon.  The Mephibosheth came to David and told him of how Ziba had tricked him and lied to David about him, David told Mephibosheth that he copuld divide the land with Ziba but Mephibosheth only wanted to be with his king he wasn't interested in the land. But at the end of this chapter the seeds were sown for a great dispute between Judah and Israel.",

David asked Uriah how the battle was going and told him to go home and relax with his wife, but Uriah was a man of great integrity and refused to go home to be comfortable with his wife while Israel was at war.  So David sent him back to the front with a note for Joab his commander to place Uriah in the heat of the battle and withdraw from him, sentencing Uriah to death.  Joab obeyed the command of David and Uriah was killed in battle, David later took Bathsheba to be his wife in order to cover up what he had done but this displeased the Lord.  David had ignored the warnings of the Lord and temptation had turned to lust, lust to adultery, adultery to deception and finally into murder, this is how our sin if unchecked can uncontollably accumulate until it utterly blinds us and only the Lord can save us.",

Absalom followed this advice.  Ahithophel, who hated David due to the fact that he was Bathsehba's grandfather, then asked Absalom if he could lead a band of men immediately and go after David and kill him, this was a brilliant plan and had it not been for the intervention of the Lord would surely have meant the end of David.  Amazingly though Absaom asked for a second oppinion from Hushai the Archite, he appealed to Absalom's vanity and advised him to amass a great army and lead them out to battle, thus buying the king time, Absalom agreed with Hushai's plan and Ahithophel knowing it would lead to ruin returned home and hanged himself as he knew David would succeed and come after him.",

He also defeated the Syrian alliance who had come against him and so Christ shall one day utterly defeat the alliance of sin, the flesh and the devil.

David was a man of the people, he was already recognised as a great leader and a man anointed of the Lord, and thus he set his sights on capturing Jerusalem for his capital, the people in Jerusakem mocked and taunted him, but David and his men heroically captured the city.  David was recognised as a great ruler by the surrounding nations and they sent skilled craftsmen to work for him.  But during this time of great success David took more wives and concubines to himself which would lead to great problems later.  The Philistines then came and invaded Israel, so David enquired of the Lord what he should do and the Lord told him to meet them head on, so David won a great victory.  But they came again and this time the Lord told David to go behind them and wait for Him to go out before them, which David did and again won a great victory.",

But the people of Israel anointed Ishbosheth, one of Sauls sons, king over Israel, Abner, commander of Sauls army, then led the army of Israel against Davids men who were led by Joab, Joab won the fight and the army of Israel had to flee.  Asahel, who was very quick, chased after Abner as they retreated, but after several warning to stop Abner killed himand carried on retreating.  The army of Israel gathered for one last stand and Abner cried to Joab to end the fighting, Joab agreed and they all left peacably, but this agreement only meant that the war between the house of Saul and the house of David went on for a long time instead of being ended quickly.",

In the days of Joshua Israel had made a covenant with the Gibeonites not to wipe them out as they were going through Canaan, and the Lord expected Israel to keep this promise.  So David met with the Gibeonites and asked them how this could be put right, the Gibeonites asked for 7 men from the house of Saul that they might execute them.  David agreed and delivered to them 7 men whom the Gibeonites hung together to show they were accursed of God.  But the mother of 2 of the men would not allow their bodies to be desecrated by being eaten by the wild animals, so she kept a vigil over them until the rains came and she knew that their deaths had not been in vain.",

Joab though instead of surrendering as was usually the case in these type of encounters, gives the army a rousing speech, reminds them of what they are fighting for and that the Lord is with them, thus they attacked and the Amonites and Syrians retreated.  Joab led the army back home instead of wiping them out, but the enemy re-assembled and came against Israel again, this time however David personally led the army and the Syrians were utterly defeated.",

David send for Mephibosheth anyway, and he must have been terrified that David would kill him as he had been in hiding for years, but David did indeed show to him the kindness of God as he gave him back all Saul's land, said that he would not kill him, and told him that from that day on he would be welcome to eat at the table of the king.

Esh drives home the importance of parents (particularly the father) drawing clear boundaries and being firm and consistent.  In a society where children often rule the home, this is a sober warning of the consequences of parental neglect in the lives of children in years to come--when it may be too late.",

The Kingdom of God and the kingdom of the world, Coming to the house of the Lord with a seemingly holy devotion for God and leaving the House of the Lord and having the same devotion for the things of the world. This is the reason why there is such a powerless testimony and the church is becoming a non issue in this society. We cannot be devoted to the Lord and be devoted to the things that offend His holy name. God is calling His church to come outside the camp and come out of mixture and compromise to serve the Lord wholeheartedly. In every generation there has to be somebody that is willing to stand in the middle of the marketplace and bear the reproach of Jesus Christ.",

Secondly, he discusses man's dealing with holy things of God, namely the ark of God. The application he preaches on is how we try to dress the gospel up to modernize it. He points out that the man who tried to steady the ark was not blaspheming God, he was not smashing it, or in any way intentionally rebelling against the Lord; but for all this, he was still disobediant and killed on the spot. \"A lady called me from the border of Mexico today...she was weeping, she said, '...oh, we do want to be such great soulwinners'...I said to her, my dear look, the first commandment is not, \"thou shalt be a soulwinner,\" the first commandment is, \"thou shalt love the Lord thy God...\"",
