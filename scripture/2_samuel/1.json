            "description": "David was in Ziklag, a city in Philistia, when an Amalekite comes from the battle between Israel and the Philistines, he tells David that Saul and his sons are dead on the field of battle and that Israel has retreated from before them, David enquires how he knows Saul is dead and the Amalekite tells him that while he was in the battle he saw Saul fall upon his own sword and call him over to him and ask that he would kill him, so the Amalekite stands over Saul and kills him, this was a lie to gain favour with David.  But he showed David the crown and bracelet that he had taken from Saul after his death, David was very grieved to hear the news and wrote a lamentation about Saul and Jonathan, this shows how David was free from the bitterness that would have ensnared his heart had he dwelt upon how Saul had wronged him. But David asks the Amalekite why he was not afraid to kill the anointed king of Israel and when the he didn't answer David had him killed for boasting over the dead.",
