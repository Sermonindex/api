            "description": "David hears that the king of Amon has died, so he sends a diplomatic envoy to the new king Amon in order to offer the hand of friendship, this is not weel received.  The ambassadors are humilitaed and abused and thrust out of Amon, this was an act of war and the Amon knew it, so they amases their army and an army of mercinaries from Syria, to make war with Israel.  David send out his whole army of mighty men led by Joab to fight the battle, but the army become surrounded.  Joab though instead of surrendering as was usually the case in these type of encounters, gives the army a rousing speech, reminds them of what they are fighting for and that the Lord is with them, thus they attacked and the Amonites and Syrians retreated.  Joab led the army back home instead of wiping them out, but the enemy re-assembled and came against Israel again, this time however David personally led the army and the Syrians were utterly defeated.",
