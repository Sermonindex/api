David is enraged when he hears the story and demands that the man be put to death and restore 4 times what he took from the poor man.  Nathan however responds that David himself is the man in the story, in that he took Bathsheba the wife of Uriah and had an adulterous relationship with her, Nathan confronted David with his sin and tells him what the Lord is going to do now because of Davids sin.  David in performing this act had shown his own despite for the commandments of the Lord, and thus from then on he had great trouble within his family.",
