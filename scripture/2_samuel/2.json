But the people of Israel anointed Ishbosheth, one of Sauls sons, king over Israel, Abner, commander of Sauls army, then led the army of Israel against Davids men who were led by Joab, Joab won the fight and the army of Israel had to flee.  Asahel, who was very quick, chased after Abner as they retreated, but after several warning to stop Abner killed himand carried on retreating.  The army of Israel gathered for one last stand and Abner cried to Joab to end the fighting, Joab agreed and they all left peacably, but this agreement only meant that the war between the house of Saul and the house of David went on for a long time instead of being ended quickly.",
