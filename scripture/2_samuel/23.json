            "description": "David was the sweet psalmist of Israel and instructs in the passage how a leader must be just and live in the fear of the Lord.  He reflected on how the Lord had blessed him so abundantly throughout his life, and shows how close David was to the Lord, how the Lord delighted in him and how he delighted in the Lord.  To David God was the Goal not a Way to the goal as He so often is today.  David also had around him his mighty men who had first joined him in the cave of Adullam when they were weak afraid and in debt, but now the they were mighty through God, as they had learned to love the Lord and had gone out and won great victories.  In chapter 24 Satan tempted David to number all of Israel in order to see how strong he was in the natural but this was a thing which the Lord had expressly forbidden.",

Keith Daniel retells many powerful stories about Gods keeping power against the hateful sin of divorce amongst Christians. This is a must hear sermon for any Christian families, what a powerful amount of testimony to overcome the devil.",
