            "description": "David took many wives to himself over the course of his life, and yet this was wrong in the eyes of God and is reflected in the trouble that came to him from his family.  Ishbosheth, the pretender to the throne, accuses Abner, his military commander, of taking Sauls concubine for himself, this enrages Abner and he deicdes to no longer support Ishbosheth but defect to Davids side.  When Abner comes to him David asks for Michal, his first wife, to be returned to him, so Abner went and took Michal from where she was and brought her back to David.  Abner then went aroung Israel declaring that everyone should recognise David as being the rightful king and there was peace, but only for a short time.  Joab, Davids military commander, returns from a campaign to hear that Abner, who had killed Joabs brother Asahel on the field of battle, has made peace with David.  So he requests to see Abner and when he came Joab killed him, because of his brother, but when David heard about this he was greatly saddened and condemned Joab and all his house for this.",
