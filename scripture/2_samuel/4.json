            "description": "When Ishbosheth hears that Abner is dead he gets very afraid and panics, and rightly so as two assasins come to his house and kill him whilst he is still in bed. They took his head and went to David to show him how they had kiled his 'enemy' and sought a reward from him.  But David was sickened by what they had done and because of the evil in their hearts, so he rebuked them for killin Ishbosheth, calling Saul 'David's enemy' and claiming they had carried out the will of the Lord. But David did not consider Saul his enemy so he commanded that the two assains should be killed, as a statement that no one should attack the house of Saul anymore.  David then went and took the head of Ishbosheth and buried it with Abner.  This showed how David was a man after the heart of the Lord as he forgave his enemies and even loved them.",
