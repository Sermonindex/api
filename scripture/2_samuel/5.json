            "description": "Ishbosheth, the pretender to the throne, was dead and all the tribes of Israel now came to accept David as king over them.  David was a man of the people, he was already recognised as a great leader and a man anointed of the Lord, and thus he set his sights on capturing Jerusalem for his capital, the people in Jerusakem mocked and taunted him, but David and his men heroically captured the city.  David was recognised as a great ruler by the surrounding nations and they sent skilled craftsmen to work for him.  But during this time of great success David took more wives and concubines to himself which would lead to great problems later.  The Philistines then came and invaded Israel, so David enquired of the Lord what he should do and the Lord told him to meet them head on, so David won a great victory.  But they came again and this time the Lord told David to go behind them and wait for Him to go out before them, which David did and again won a great victory.",

In this message, a stark contrast is derived between man methods and means the beauty and Holiness of God and the obedience God requires of us to stay on the very narrow truth no matter how limited it might seem to man.
