So they get together a large group of worshippers and put the Ark on a brand new cart pulled by oxen and head for Jerusalem.  On the way the cattle stumble and the Ark almost falls to the ground, but is stopped by the hand of Uzzah who is escorting the cart.  The Lord is furious and strikes Uzzah dead on the spot.  David sends the Ark to the house of Obededom and the Lord blesses the house.  David seeks the Lord on how He wants the Ark to be brought back Jerusalem and the Lord instructs him the correct way.  So David brought the Ark back no leaving anything to chance and dances before the Lord with all his might.  But he is despised by his wife Michal for wearing a linen ephod and dancing and she rebukes him when he returns home for this the Lord caused her to be barren for the rest of her life.",

The Ark's stay at the house of Obed-Edom with blessing sparked hope in David that God can be pleased when he sought Him by revelation of Scripture.  The second parade that escorted the Ark to Jerusalem was by a transformed David dressed no longer as a king but a humble priest 'outside the camp'.",

Although God may honor the world's efforts, his people must only do things the way he has required -- David learned this when he tried to move the ark as the Philistines had, costing Uzzah his life. The Church must never employ the world's methods, for God will only bless the obedience of his people.",

            "description": "Brother Len speaks on absolute obediance and how it is necessary to walking in God's will; that without this obediance we begin to dry up spiritually. Secondly, he discusses man's dealing with holy things of God, namely the ark of God. The application he preaches on is how we try to dress the gospel up to modernize it. He points out that the man who tried to steady the ark was not blaspheming God, he was not smashing it, or in any way intentionally rebelling against the Lord; but for all this, he was still disobediant and killed on the spot. \"A lady called me from the border of Mexico today...she was weeping, she said, '...oh, we do want to be such great soulwinners'...I said to her, my dear look, the first commandment is not, \"thou shalt be a soulwinner,\" the first commandment is, \"thou shalt love the Lord thy God...\"",
