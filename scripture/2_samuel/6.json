So they get together a large group of worshippers and put the Ark on a brand new cart pulled by oxen and head for Jerusalem.  On the way the cattle stumble and the Ark almost falls to the ground, but is stopped by the hand of Uzzah who is escorting the cart.  The Lord is furious and strikes Uzzah dead on the spot.  David sends the Ark to the house of Obededom and the Lord blesses the house.  David seeks the Lord on how He wants the Ark to be brought back Jerusalem and the Lord instructs him the correct way.  So David brought the Ark back no leaving anything to chance and dances before the Lord with all his might.  But he is despised by his wife Michal for wearing a linen ephod and dancing and she rebukes him when he returns home for this the Lord caused her to be barren for the rest of her life.",
