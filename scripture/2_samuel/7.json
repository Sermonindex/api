David loved the Lord so much that he wanted to give more to the Lord than the Lord asked of him, the Lord told David that he would be the father of the men who would build His house, the first would Solomon who built the temple in Jerusalem, but the second Son of David would build a house for God that would last forever, and this is of course the Lord Jesus, Who is at this time building His church.  David humbled himself and blessed the Lord for his promises.  He accepted the promises of the Lord and asked only that the Lord would carry out His promises to build His house with his descendants.",
