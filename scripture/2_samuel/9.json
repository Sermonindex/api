            "description": "David asks if there is anyone left frm the house of Saulthat he might show to them the kindness of God, so he calls a servant of Saul to him and aks if there is anyone, the servant informs him of Mephibosheth who was the son of Jonathan, David's close friend, but the servant also informs David that Mephibosheth is lame in both his feet thus posing no threat to David's rule over Israel.  David send for Mephibosheth anyway, and he must have been terrified that David would kill him as he had been in hiding for years, but David did indeed show to him the kindness of God as he gave him back all Saul's land, said that he would not kill him, and told him that from that day on he would be welcome to eat at the table of the king.  This of course is a wonderful picture of our relationship to the Lord Jesus who has forgiven us, given us back more than we lost in Adam and invites us always to dine at His table, with Him.  What a God we serve.",

            "description": "March 11, 2007 - This message is for Christians that have positioned themselves in the center of two different kingdoms. The Kingdom of God and the kingdom of the world, Coming to the house of the Lord with a seemingly holy devotion for God and leaving the House of the Lord and having the same devotion for the things of the world. This is the reason why there is such a powerless testimony and the church is becoming a non issue in this society. We cannot be devoted to the Lord and be devoted to the things that offend His holy name. God is calling His church to come outside the camp and come out of mixture and compromise to serve the Lord wholeheartedly. In every generation there has to be somebody that is willing to stand in the middle of the marketplace and bear the reproach of Jesus Christ.",
