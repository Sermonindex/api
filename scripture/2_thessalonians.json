When Luther nailed his theses to the door of the cathedral at Wittenburg,135 cautious men were astonished at his audacity. When John Wesley ignored all church restrictions136 and religious propriety and preached in the fields and byways, men declared his reputation was ruined. So it has been in all ages. When the religious condition of the times called for men who were willing to sacrifice all for Christ, the demand created the supply, and there have always been found a few who have been willing to be regarded reckless for the Lord. An utter recklessness concerning men\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s opinions and other consequences is the only attitude137 that can meet the exigencies of the present times.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d",

            "description": "Delivered on Sabbath Morning, July 18, 1858Spurgeon here gives a magnificent exposition on \"little-faith\" and \"great-faith.\" He offers some wise ways to strengthen your faith. He proposes to dwell upon the promises of God, associate yourself with Godly men, die to self, and go through great trouble. For, \"we don't grow strong in faith on sunshiny days. It is only in strong weather that a man gets faith.\" Spurgeon then offers a striking and wonderful appeal to the \"pew-warmer,\" which I am compelled to include: Do you want to get your faith strong? Use it. You lazy lie-a-bed Christians, that go up to your churches and chapels, and take your seats, and hear our sermons, and talk about getting good, but never think about doing good; ye that are letting hell fill beneath you, and yet are too idle to stretch out your hands to pluck brands from the eternal burning; ye that see sin running down your streets, yet can never put so much as your foot to turn or stem the current, I wonder not that you have to complain of the littleness of your faith. It ought to be little; you do but little. And why should God give you more strength than you mean to use. Strong faith must always be an exercised faith.",

Persecution of the 1st and 2nd centuries phased out as Christianity became universally accepted starting with Constantine (313 AD).  New creeds formed to combat new heresies, but even the biblically based creeds turned into dead orthodoxy, which gave rise to counter movements.  Parkyns outlines gospel developments, monastic orders, and adoption of paganism by the 'official church' in Europe (particularly the British Isles), the rise to preeminence of the bishop of Rome, and a renewed interest in the Church about the coming of the Antichrist.",

The major contributions are eschatological, investigating especially the events preceding and accompanying the return of Christ. The concern of Paul for his followers is apparent throughout.",

They preach a polluted and diluted gospel that no longer deals with the Blood of Jesus and the Cross. Many christains are given over to spirtual harlotry and sit comfortable in their sin without any desire to be convicted or corrected but rather prefer to hear smooth messages. In the midst of this wickedness God is going to move supernaturally by His Spirit and cause us to cease from this apostasy and harlotry. In these last days God will remember His coveanat and pour out His grace and mercy and redeem a people onto Himself.",
