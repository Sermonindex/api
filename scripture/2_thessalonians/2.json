When Luther nailed his theses to the door of the cathedral at Wittenburg,135 cautious men were astonished at his audacity. When John Wesley ignored all church restrictions136 and religious propriety and preached in the fields and byways, men declared his reputation was ruined. So it has been in all ages. When the religious condition of the times called for men who were willing to sacrifice all for Christ, the demand created the supply, and there have always been found a few who have been willing to be regarded reckless for the Lord. An utter recklessness concerning men\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s opinions and other consequences is the only attitude137 that can meet the exigencies of the present times.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d",

Persecution of the 1st and 2nd centuries phased out as Christianity became universally accepted starting with Constantine (313 AD).  New creeds formed to combat new heresies, but even the biblically based creeds turned into dead orthodoxy, which gave rise to counter movements.  Parkyns outlines gospel developments, monastic orders, and adoption of paganism by the 'official church' in Europe (particularly the British Isles), the rise to preeminence of the bishop of Rome, and a renewed interest in the Church about the coming of the Antichrist.",

They preach a polluted and diluted gospel that no longer deals with the Blood of Jesus and the Cross. Many christains are given over to spirtual harlotry and sit comfortable in their sin without any desire to be convicted or corrected but rather prefer to hear smooth messages. In the midst of this wickedness God is going to move supernaturally by His Spirit and cause us to cease from this apostasy and harlotry. In these last days God will remember His coveanat and pour out His grace and mercy and redeem a people onto Himself.",
