We are all resistant to change especially when it involves what we perceive to be hardship or loss to ourselves or someone we love. There is nothing in us that wants to gravitate toward difficulty. In the western world we have formed a Christian theological perspective that avoids difficulty, which results in an anemic Christianity. When we get a word from the Lord that sometimes doesn't make sense to the natural mind, we must be careful to who and what we listen to. There are well meaning people all along our journey that will unknowingly try to break your heart of obedience. God call us to a radical obedience where we will go where you lead us no matter what the cost! When we learn to walk in the ways of God and follow the voice of God the miraculous is released in our lives. Are you willing to respond to the Lord with, \u201chere I am Lord, send me\u201d?",

He also talks about areas of the world where he believed revival was currently happening, along with some of the mistakes that people have made after revival has occurred.  \"I shudder to hear of people who claim to be filled with the Holy Spirit without any holiness of life.\" Dr. Orr talks about how after years of revival work he kept himself renewed. \"Evan Roberts once said to me 'always pray for a vision to match your faith'.\"",

He identified the growing seeds of failure, such as the tendency to 'bind the gospel with legal restrictions.'  Both Paul and Jesus warned of corruption in the Church; the reality of the grace of God and the gifts of the Spirit were lost.  Increasing differences between laity and clergy developed into an 'obey us' mentality and the growing corruption gave birth to hermit movements.",

Will you be able to stand up against the devil for your brothers and sisters in the church? Don't be willing to let them go. Hate it when you see the devil gain the advantage. Jesus left the flock for the one. He left the 99 for the one. When you see it, you pray, and you fast for them. You intercede, encourage, lift up. Support. This is the heart of God for his people and this is how he wants them to love one another. Ask God to give you the discernment to see the needs of others around you.

If we are going to put the cup to our mouth we must come to the place where we cry like Jesus \"NOT MY WILL BUT THINE BE DONE\".

            "description": "This sermon explores the danger of irreverence towards God in our associations and in ministry. There will always be people among us who desire to go back to \"Egypt.\" To them it is the land flowing with milk and honey. We must avoid their irreverant and profane words. We must avoid them and their influence. That is, we must \"purge ourselves of these\" in order to be pure and useful to God. In fact, Paul references the rebellion of Korah in 2 Timothy 2:19ff. as an example of God's estimate of this type of sin and rebellion.",

MY incessant anxiety for you, dearly beloved in the faith of Jesus Christ, is that I may be able, in the first place, to teach you what God's truth is; and then, trusting that I have to the best of my ability taught you what I believe to be God's most holy gospel, my next anxiety is, that you should \u201chold fast the form of sound words,\u201d that whatever may occur in the future, should death snatch away your pastor, or should anything occur which might put you in perilous circumstances, so that you were tempted to embrace any system of heresy, you might every one of you stand as firm and as unmoved as rocks, and as strong as mountains be, abiding in the faith which was once delivered unto the saints,\u201d whereof ye have heard, and which we have proclaimed unto you. If the gospel be worth your hearing, and if it be a true gospel, it is worth your holding, and our anxiety is, that you should be so established in the faith, that you may, \u201chold fast the profession of your faith without wavering, for he is faithful that has promised.\u201d The Apostle most earnestly admonished Timothy to \u201chold fast the form of sound words which he had heard of him in faith and love which is in Christ Jesus.\u201d",
