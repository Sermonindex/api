Dr. Orr discusses how he believed that Satan was the main hindrance to people understanding revival, and though he was a revival scholar, his intent was not to increase knowledge on the subject for the sake of increasing knowledge, but rather to increase knowledge of revival to enable people to be subjects of revival. He also talks about areas of the world where he believed revival was currently happening, along with some of the mistakes that people have made after revival has occurred.  \"I shudder to hear of people who claim to be filled with the Holy Spirit without any holiness of life.\" Dr. Orr talks about how after years of revival work he kept himself renewed. \"Evan Roberts once said to me 'always pray for a vision to match your faith'.\"",

If we are going to put the cup to our mouth we must come to the place where we cry like Jesus \"NOT MY WILL BUT THINE BE DONE\". This is a place where the only strength we have is to lift up the cup and call on the name of Jesus. In these times of darkness don't cast away your confidence in God because there is a great reward for those who drink this cup in faith and trust.",

            "description": "A SERMON DELIVERED ON SABBATH MORNING, MAY 11, 1856, BY THE REV. C. H. SPURGEON, AT NEW PARK STREET CHAPEL, SOUTHWARK \u201cHold fast the form of sound words, which thou hast heard of me, in faith and love which is in Christ Jesus.\u201d \u2014 2 Timothy 1:13. MY incessant anxiety for you, dearly beloved in the faith of Jesus Christ, is that I may be able, in the first place, to teach you what God's truth is; and then, trusting that I have to the best of my ability taught you what I believe to be God's most holy gospel, my next anxiety is, that you should \u201chold fast the form of sound words,\u201d that whatever may occur in the future, should death snatch away your pastor, or should anything occur which might put you in perilous circumstances, so that you were tempted to embrace any system of heresy, you might every one of you stand as firm and as unmoved as rocks, and as strong as mountains be, abiding in the faith which was once delivered unto the saints,\u201d whereof ye have heard, and which we have proclaimed unto you. If the gospel be worth your hearing, and if it be a true gospel, it is worth your holding, and our anxiety is, that you should be so established in the faith, that you may, \u201chold fast the profession of your faith without wavering, for he is faithful that has promised.\u201d The Apostle most earnestly admonished Timothy to \u201chold fast the form of sound words which he had heard of him in faith and love which is in Christ Jesus.\u201d",
