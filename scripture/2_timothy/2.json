We are all resistant to change especially when it involves what we perceive to be hardship or loss to ourselves or someone we love. There is nothing in us that wants to gravitate toward difficulty. In the western world we have formed a Christian theological perspective that avoids difficulty, which results in an anemic Christianity. When we get a word from the Lord that sometimes doesn't make sense to the natural mind, we must be careful to who and what we listen to. There are well meaning people all along our journey that will unknowingly try to break your heart of obedience. God call us to a radical obedience where we will go where you lead us no matter what the cost! When we learn to walk in the ways of God and follow the voice of God the miraculous is released in our lives. Are you willing to respond to the Lord with, \u201chere I am Lord, send me\u201d?",

When God sends someone to you who needs encouragement, lifting up will you be able to take time to support those who are falling down? Will you be able to stand up against the devil for your brothers and sisters in the church? Don't be willing to let them go. Hate it when you see the devil gain the advantage. Jesus left the flock for the one. He left the 99 for the one. When you see it, you pray, and you fast for them. You intercede, encourage, lift up. Support. This is the heart of God for his people and this is how he wants them to love one another. Ask God to give you the discernment to see the needs of others around you. To look past your needs and problems to those around you.",

Paul Washer said he was one of the most godly men he met in Canada.\r\n\r\nBill Mcleod had been praying and had his congregation praying for revival for years. On, October 17, 1971, God in His sovereignty came in revival. Without human means or explanation, the revival spread from church to church, community to community, city to city, and not long after from province to province. This has become known as the 1971 Canadian Revival movement.",
