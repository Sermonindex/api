When Christ becomes central to our thinking, we can have full confidence in the sovereign supply of Jesus Christ!  (This message was delivered at Harvey-Cedars Conference 2006).",

We are all resistant to change especially when it involves what we perceive to be hardship or loss to ourselves or someone we love. There is nothing in us that wants to gravitate toward difficulty. In the western world we have formed a Christian theological perspective that avoids difficulty, which results in an anemic Christianity. When we get a word from the Lord that sometimes doesn't make sense to the natural mind, we must be careful to who and what we listen to. There are well meaning people all along our journey that will unknowingly try to break your heart of obedience. God call us to a radical obedience where we will go where you lead us no matter what the cost! When we learn to walk in the ways of God and follow the voice of God the miraculous is released in our lives. Are you willing to respond to the Lord with, \u201chere I am Lord, send me\u201d?",

When God sends someone to you who needs encouragement, lifting up will you be able to take time to support those who are falling down? Will you be able to stand up against the devil for your brothers and sisters in the church? Don't be willing to let them go. Hate it when you see the devil gain the advantage. Jesus left the flock for the one. He left the 99 for the one. When you see it, you pray, and you fast for them. You intercede, encourage, lift up. Support. This is the heart of God for his people and this is how he wants them to love one another. Ask God to give you the discernment to see the needs of others around you. To look past your needs and problems to those around you.",

There will always be people among us who desire to go back to \"Egypt.\" To them it is the land flowing with milk and honey. We must avoid their irreverant and profane words. We must avoid them and their influence. That is, we must \"purge ourselves of these\" in order to be pure and useful to God. In fact, Paul references the rebellion of Korah in 2 Timothy 2:19ff. as an example of God's estimate of this type of sin and rebellion.",
