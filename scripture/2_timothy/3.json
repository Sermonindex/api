This was a surprise and great blessing for before we were never aware of this underground house Church name. After reading their statement of faith, there was an immediate burden to make this statement of faith available to Gospel Fellowships and to any other house Churches or groups that would like to identify with the statement.

We will stand before a Holy God and everything that is dark will be brought into the light of Christ. Jesus Christ has made every provision for us to live a life of purity. God wants to bury our sin and old nature so that we may live in the fear of God. We can choose to bury our sins today or our sins will bury us tomorrow. It time to get real with God!",

He identified the growing seeds of failure, such as the tendency to 'bind the gospel with legal restrictions.'  Both Paul and Jesus warned of corruption in the Church; the reality of the grace of God and the gifts of the Spirit were lost.  Increasing differences between laity and clergy developed into an 'obey us' mentality and the growing corruption gave birth to hermit movements.",

The creation pictures several foundational principles of Christian living: remaking ruined humanity, separating light from darkness, and overcoming.  We also see the two streams running throughout the Bible--Babylon and Jerusalem--starting with two men who listened to the devil (Adam and Cain) and two men who walked with God (Enoch and Noah).",
