And lastly and most importantly the principle not by might nor by power but by my spirit saith the Lord.",

Major Thomas explains that human beings are composed of two basic parts -- that which can be seen (the  body) and that which cannot be seen (the spirit and soul). That part no one sees constitutes the real you and the actions of the body often mirrors our true spiritual health.",
