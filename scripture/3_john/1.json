            "description": "In 3 John 1-2, the Apostle John greets Gaius \"whom I love in truth.\" He continues: \"I wish above all that thou mayest prosper and be in health, even as thy soul prospereth.\" Is your body as healthy as  your soul? Major Thomas explains that human beings are composed of two basic parts -- that which can be seen (the  body) and that which cannot be seen (the spirit and soul). That part no one sees constitutes the real you and the actions of the body often mirrors our true spiritual health.",
