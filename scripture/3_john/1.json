            "description": "In 3 John 1-2, the Apostle John greets Gaius \"whom I love in truth.\" He continues: \"I wish above all that thou mayest prosper and be in health, even as thy soul prospereth.\" Is your body as healthy as  your soul? Major Thomas explains that human beings are composed of two basic parts -- that which can be seen (the  body) and that which cannot be seen (the spirit and soul). That part no one sees constitutes the real you and the actions of the body often mirrors our true spiritual health.",

Evangelical writer, theological teacher and founder of the Torchbearers bible schools. These schools are now world-wide in many countries and provide a teaching base on the person of Christ in the believer and basic Biblical exposition of Bible books.\r\n\r\nAmong the many books that he wrote, the most influential have been: \"The Saving Life Of Christ\" , \"The mystery of godliness\" and \"If I perish, I Perish.\" His burden in ministry was to express and show the indwelling life of Christ in believers and the rest and power that life will have in us as we trust and have faith.",
