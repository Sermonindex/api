The Bible tells us that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153as newborn babes\u00e2\u20ac\u009d we have to grow.  \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Grow in grace and in the knowledge of our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d  Who would like to see a baby remain a baby?  You wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t like that, would you?  You\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d like to see them grow, get strong, get tall, become men and women.  And so my God has ordained that His children should grow, and grow into the full stature of the full measure of the manhood in Christ Jesus.",
