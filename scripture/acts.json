There is a great benefit at times in having a building where the Lord\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s people can meet in and use for the ministry of the Gospel. Yet, when we look at the Book of Acts, we find no visible record that the Church built buildings. Though they met in some physical locations such as Solomon\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Colonnade113 and the hall of Tyrannus for even two years!114 Yet, this was not the common practice of how saints met across the rest of God\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Churches. Even when looking carefully in Church history it is hard to find evidence of a building being used until 300 AD when pagan temples were being converted into churches under the reign of Constantine.",

As the prophet says: \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcHeaven is My throne, and the earth is My footstool. What kind of house will you build for Me? Says the Lord. Or where will My resting place be?

It is accepted as the will of God at times to suffer601 and to even expect severe persecution. This type of suffering produces a joy602 and sense of privilege that they are willing to identify with their precious Lord who has saved them.",

When we have God in the midst everything changes. We will not be able to stay quiet, we will speak boldly for our Lord that bought us with such a great price.1003 The underground Church in China chooses their leadership from those who are the hungriest after God.

WE are just coming to the most beautiful season of the year \u2014 the spring, when everything around us is shaking off the chill grave clothes of winter, and putting on the beautiful array of a new life. The church of God was in that condition at Pentecost, her winter was past, and the flowers appeared on the earth. She enjoyed the spring breezes, for the breath of the Holy Spirit refreshed her garden: there was spring music \u2014 the time of the singing of birds was come, for her preachers testified faithfully of Jesus, and so many and varied were the sweet notes which welcomed the new season, that many nations of men heard in their own tongue the wonderful works of God. There was, also, the spring blossoming, the fig tree put forth her green figs, and the vines with the tender grapes gave a good smell, for all around multitudes inquired, \u201cMen and brethren, what must we do?\u201d and many also avowed their faith in Jesus. There were the spring showers of repentance, the spring sun-gleams of joy in the Holy Ghost and the spring flowers of newly-given hope and faith. May we behold just such another spring time in all the churches of Jesus Christ throughout the world, and meanwhile let us arouse ourselves suitable to so gladsome a season.

I came to Christ at a Billy Graham Los Angeles Crusade in the 1960's. While completing my Bachelor of Science degree in Business Administration at Cal Poly Pomona, I sensed the call of God on my life to follow Jesus Christ completely and possibly forget business and prepare for the ministry.. Soon after that I met Alan Redpath who invited me and my wife Jean to England, where we attended Capernwray Bible School. Upon returning to the United States, I continued my studies at Talbot Seminary in La Mirada, California.\r\nEarly in my ministry, I served for four years as an assistant pastor to Chuck Smith at Calvary Chapel of Costa Mesa, California. Next Jean and I moved to Lake Arrowhead where we planted and pastored Calvary Chapel of Lake Arrowhead. During those years I founded Calvary Chapel Bible College in nearby Twin Peaks at the Calvary Chapel Conference Center (The college is now located in Murrieta Hot Springs). Sensing the Lord's direction to move on, we then pioneered and pastored another Calvary Chapel in Redlands, California, for eleven years. In 1991, we again, still having that pioneering heart, moved to San Jose with the heart to plant a number of churches in the Bay Area. There are now eight fellowships that have grown out of Calvary Chapel of San Jose. In September 2002, we responded to a request from Chuck Smith to return to Calvary Chapel of Costa Mesa to serve as an assistant. And, in 2004 we took to the leadership of Calvary Chapel of Laguna Beach to help guide it through a difficult time. That work being completed, we have now responded to a long time desire to step out and serve the churches and schools and missionaries that we love so much around the world. Which brings us now to Calvary Way Ministries.",

            "description": "January 10, 2010 - Have you ever asked yourself why do things have to change? We are all resistant to change especially when it involves what we perceive to be hardship or loss to ourselves or someone we love. There is nothing in us that wants to gravitate toward difficulty. In the western world we have formed a Christian theological perspective that avoids difficulty, which results in an anemic Christianity. When we get a word from the Lord that sometimes doesn't make sense to the natural mind, we must be careful to who and what we listen to. There are well meaning people all along our journey that will unknowingly try to break your heart of obedience. God call us to a radical obedience where we will go where you lead us no matter what the cost! When we learn to walk in the ways of God and follow the voice of God the miraculous is released in our lives. Are you willing to respond to the Lord with, \u201chere I am Lord, send me\u201d?",

Too many refuse to fellowship with one another because of their differences. Their is no scripture to condone such division and denominational loyalty. There is one Lord, one faith, and one baptism. A convicting message on dealing with our prejudices. By the way believers live their lives they represent Christ to the world who watches with suspicion. Peter had a hard time dealing with the acceptance of the Gentiles, and learning to share God with them. The Jews had long held the belief God was theirs alone. The Lord revolutionized Peter's and the apostles' thinking when he gave the Holy Ghost to the Gentiles, too. May he revolutionize ours as well.

Today some churches still have the tradition to hold this type of feast where the people bring thanksgiving gifts to God. A little boy was present at one of these offerings, and when the others brought their thanksgiving gifts, he realised that he had nothing to give to Jesus.

It is through these fiery trials that we come out with an inner strength that declares mo matter what happens the life of God in us cannot be triumphed over! The key to this kind of life is to be free of offence and to have a good conscience towards God and man and to refuse to speak evil in a difficult situation. It doesn't matter how we feel or what happens, we must always allow the Holy Spirit to lead us back in line with the truth of God's Word. Do you want to stand in the fire? Your strength comes from allowing God's Word to have the last say in every circumstance!",

From John 3:16, Matthew 20:28, Acts 20:35, he asks us to note four truths: 1) the father gave his Son, 2) the Son gave his life, 3) they did so in order that we might be ransomed, and 4) it is more blessed to give than to receive. Dr. Tozer then considers who we might want to thank some day for the gifts that they gave to Jesus. The wise men gave gold (lasting treasure), frankincense (worship), and myrrh (bitter sacrifice); Mary gave her mortal body; Joseph gave his faith; the shepherds gave their reverent wonder; Lazarus and his sisters, Mary and Martha, gave the welcome of their home; the women following Jesus gave a seamless, linen robe; and Joseph of Arimathaea gave his own, new grave. These are the gifts that they gave to Jesus. What might we give him that we might not be outdone in giving?",

Was a preacher born in Bangor, County Down, Ireland. Nicknamed \"the Tornado of the Pulpit\", Nicholson spent his early years on his father's cargo ship. He began to preach Christianity in 1899 at the age of 23 and was known for his \"men-only\" meetings. Nicholson used straightforward language which communicated to the common man.\r\n\"Nicholson used to say that when a mission was begun it was not long before they had either a riot or revival. Sometimes we had more riot than revival, but never a revival without a riot.\" Nicholson wielded the Sword of the Spirit with a fury. His hearers were always affected one way or another. Some through his preaching were brought to humble repentance, while others resisted God's Word with indignation. Two favorite themes of Nicholson were \"God's love\" and \"God's hell.\" W. P. Nicholson always preached the love of God with all the warmth and tenderness he could muster; but for those who rejected this Good News, he offered the only alternative, GOD'S HELL. He preached on every aspect of hell with such zeal and passion that his hearers claimed to be able to almost smell the burning sulphur. Still others, under deep conviction and anxiety, dripped with sweat and unconsciously shredded the hymn books they held in their laps. Through this kind of fervent preaching, God brought entire communities face to face with the question, \"What shall I do with Jesus?\" One elderly man who had recollections of the Ulster Revival of 1859 said that some of the effects of Nicholson's meetings even exceeded what happened in '59. Another commentator on Nicholson's work said that he had seen nothing like it since the days of D. L. Moody.",

In addition his careful handling of God's Word, he cites pertinent and interesting examples from revivals from the not-so-distant past such as James McGrady in 1800, the American revival of 1858 and the Welsh revival in early 1900's.  He deals with misconceptions of praying only for leaders and not whole congregations, pointing out from Acts how the Holy Spirit fills both individuals and entire congregations.  Guzik appeals to let go of the 'machinery' of men to earnestly seek God in prayer for 'a unique stirring of the Spirit of God' in our day!",

SPURGEON, AT EXETER HALL, STRAND. \u201cServing the Lord with all humility of mind.\u201d \u2014 Acts 20:19. IT is not often that a man may safely speak about his own humility. Humble men are mostly conscious of great pride, while those who are boastful of humility have nothing but false pretense, and really lack and want it. I question whether any of us are at all judges as to our pride or humility; for verily, pride so often assumes the shape of lowliness when it hath its own end to serve, and lowliness on the other hand is so perfectly compatible with a heavenly dignity of decision, that it is not easy at all times to discover which is the counterfeit and which is the precious and genuine coin. You will remember that in the case in our text, Paul speaks by inspiration. If it were not for this fact, I would not have believed even Paul himself when he spoke of his own humility. So distrustful do I feel of our judgment upon this point, that if he had not spoken under the infallible witness and guidance of the Holy Spirit, I should have said that the text was not true, and that when a man should say he served God with humbleness of mind, speaking merely from his own judgment, there was clear proof before you that he was a proud man. But Paul speaketh not to his own commendation, but with the sole motive of clearing his hands of the blood of all men.",

He prayed, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Oh my Lord, let my heart break with the things that break Your heart\u00e2\u20ac\u009d and his life was never the same. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s his belief that one can only demonstrate God\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s love by loving people. After over four decades of selfless service, he says, I have no regrets in praying that prayer for I know God has touched millions through what He did in and through me. It is all God\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s grace.\r\n\r\nHe spent the early years of his service in North India and traveled to the remote villages sharing the love of Christ and doing charitable works. Through numerous encounters during those years, he was instilled with an increasing passion to bring hope, peace, and comfort to the needy and deprived. His sacrificial commitment, farsightedness and aptitude to perceive helped him to lead a life of unhindered devotion to serve Christ and His church. K.P. Yohannan is also the voice of Athmeeya Yathra, touching millions through his daily radio and TV broadcasts. His 250 books offer practical and spiritual guidance on hundreds of subjects.",

A spiritual crisis during this period\u2014as he described two decades later in what is probably his best-known recorded teaching, \"Ten Shekels and a Shirt\"--left Reidhead with the conviction that much of evangelicalism had adopted utilitarian and humanistic philosophies contradictory to Biblical teaching. The end of all being, he came to believe, was not the happiness of man, but the glorification of God. This theme would recur throughout his later teaching.\r\n\r\nSince Mr. Reidhead's death in 1992, Bible Teaching Ministries, Inc. continues under the leadership of his wife, Marjorie, and daughter, Virginia Teitt, a dedicated Board, and the many people who have donated time and talent after being changed by God\u2019s Word through this message. The message of the Gospel is reaching an ever-widening audience all over the world.",

Was an Anglican cleric and Christian theologian. Wesley is largely credited, along with his brother Charles Wesley, as founding the Methodist movement which began when he took to open-air preaching in a similar manner to George Whitefield. In contrast to Whitefield's Calvinism, Wesley embraced the Arminian doctrines that were dominant in the 18th-century Church of England. Methodism in both forms became a highly successful evangelical movement in Britain, which encouraged people to experience Jesus Christ personally.\r\n\r\nWesley helped to organise and form societies of Christians throughout Great Britain, North America and Ireland as small groups that developed intensive, personal accountability, discipleship and religious instruction among members. His great contribution was to appoint itinerant, unordained preachers who travelled widely to evangelise and care for people in the societies. Under Wesley's direction, Methodists became leaders in many social issues of the day, including the prison reform and abolitionism movements.",

Many other things we might give thee warning of (gentle Reader) if we had not exceeded the measure of a Preface already. It remaineth, that we commend thee to God, and to the Spirit of his grace, which is able to build further than we can ask or think. He removeth the scales from our eyes, the vail from our hearts, opening our wits that we may understand his word, enlarging our hearts, yea correcting our affections, that we may love it to the end. Ye are brought unto fountains of living water which ye digged not; do not cast earth into them with the Philistines, neither prefer broken pits before them with the wicked Jews. [Gen 26:15. Jer 2:13.] Others have laboured, and you may enter into their labours; O receive not so great things in vain, O despise not so great salvation! Be not like swine to tread under foot so precious things, neither yet like dogs to tear and abuse holy things. Say not to our Saviour with the Gergesites, Depart out of our coast [Matt 8:34]; neither yet with Esau sell your birthright for a mess of pottage [Heb 12:16]. If light be come into the world, love not darkness more than light; if food, if clothing be offered, go not naked, starve not yourselves. Remember the advice of Nazianzene, \"It is a grievous thing\" (or dangerous) \"to neglect a great fair, and to seek to make markets afterwards:\" also the encouragement of S. Chrysostom, \"It is altogether impossible, that he that is sober\" (and watchful) \"should at any time be neglected:\" [S. Chrysost. in epist. ad Rom. cap. 14. oral. 26.]\r\nLastly, the admonition and menacing of S. Augustine, \"They that despise God's will inviting them, shall feel God's will taking vengeance of them.\" [S. August. ad artic. sibi falso object. Artic. 16.] It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God; [Heb 10:31] but a blessed thing it is, and will bring us to everlasting blessedness in the end, when God speaketh unto us, to hearken; when he setteth his word before us, to read it; when he stretcheth out his hand and calleth, to answer, Here am I, here we are to do thy will, O God. The Lord work a care and conscience in us to know him and serve him, that we may be acknowledged of him at the appearing of our Lord Jesus Christ, to whom with the holy Ghost, be all praise and thanksgiving.

His eschatological insight is a very needful truth to be realized in the body of Christ. \r\n\r\nArt was a prophetic voice insofar as he called his listeners to purposes in God that would affect both time and eternity, purposes that had to do with the glory of God in the Church.

Was a preacher born in Bangor, County Down, Ireland. Nicknamed \"the Tornado of the Pulpit\", Nicholson spent his early years on his father's cargo ship. He began to preach Christianity in 1899 at the age of 23 and was known for his \"men-only\" meetings. Nicholson used straightforward language which communicated to the common man.\r\n\"Nicholson used to say that when a mission was begun it was not long before they had either a riot or revival. Sometimes we had more riot than revival, but never a revival without a riot.\" Nicholson wielded the Sword of the Spirit with a fury. His hearers were always affected one way or another. Some through his preaching were brought to humble repentance, while others resisted God's Word with indignation. Two favorite themes of Nicholson were \"God's love\" and \"God's hell.\" W. P. Nicholson always preached the love of God with all the warmth and tenderness he could muster; but for those who rejected this Good News, he offered the only alternative, GOD'S HELL. He preached on every aspect of hell with such zeal and passion that his hearers claimed to be able to almost smell the burning sulphur. Still others, under deep conviction and anxiety, dripped with sweat and unconsciously shredded the hymn books they held in their laps. Through this kind of fervent preaching, God brought entire communities face to face with the question, \"What shall I do with Jesus?\" One elderly man who had recollections of the Ulster Revival of 1859 said that some of the effects of Nicholson's meetings even exceeded what happened in '59. Another commentator on Nicholson's work said that he had seen nothing like it since the days of D. L. Moody.",

This passage also has a very strong message to those who are not Christians. Our society has separated character and integrity from the ability to do a job. Our culture used to know better. Where are our virtues? In God's sight, ministry and service in the house of the Lord is integrally linked to character. When looking at 1 Timothy 3 and Titus 1, the requirements for elders and deacons, only one is related intellectual ability. The rest are character issues. Yet ordination services often appear to focus mainly on theological issues. It may be that you are like those in 7:51, religious, but stiff-necked, spiritually dead. Do not do what those men did. Today is the day of salvation. The gospel is freely offered to you. The Lord is still a God of Mercy. Lay hold of the Lord Jesus Christ.",

Whilst accounting for this case of cure, or, if I may use the expression, for this case of temporal salvation, the apostle Peter had this thought suggested to him, \u201cWhile I am accounting for the salvation of this man from lameness, I have now a fine opportunity of showing to these people, who otherwise will not listen to us, the way of the salvation of the soul.\u201d So he proceeds from the less to the greater, from the healing of a man's limb to the healing of a man's spirit; and having informed them once that it was through the name of Jesus Christ that the impotent man had been made whole, he now announces that salvation, \u2014 the great salvation, must be wrought by the selfsame means; \u201cNeither is there salvation in any other: for there is none other name under heaven given among men, whereby we must be saved.\u201d What a great word that word \u201csalvation\u201d is!...",

Amidst this great crisis, the Church seems to be sleeping. We desperately need true revival from heaven.

We pray that this is just not another conference or meeting, but a crisis point that we can hear clearly God\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s heart and respond with repentance and prayer. It is not too late for God to send revival, revive His Church, and win the lost world to Himself.\r\n\r\nAll speakers have come freely on their own accord not recieving any honorium.

In these last days God will bring the truth of Christ back into focus through His church. When this religious system sees the children of God who are empowered by the Holy Spirit and walking in the joy of Jesus, then many will turn back to the Lord in this generation.

It's always been Satan's desire to either have man withdraw his hand from being extended on God's behalf, or to distort the image of God's hand as He is revealed through man's hand. For those of us whose hands have been bitten by the very people God has sent us to help, God is saying DONT GIVE UP. God is calling us to a militant forgiveness so that God's hands will be extended through our hands to reach a fallen world.
