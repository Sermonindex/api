Yet in almost every Christian circle and denomination, there is an emphasis upon building the church, not that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153the body of Christ may be built up\u00e2\u20ac\u009d112 but rather the building of an actual structure that we refer to commonly as the church. There is a great benefit at times in having a building where the Lord\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s people can meet in and use for the ministry of the Gospel. Yet, when we look at the Book of Acts, we find no visible record that the Church built buildings. Though they met in some physical locations such as Solomon\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Colonnade113 and the hall of Tyrannus for even two years!114 Yet, this was not the common practice of how saints met across the rest of God\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Churches. Even when looking carefully in Church history it is hard to find evidence of a building being used until 300 AD when pagan temples were being converted into churches under the reign of Constantine.",

            "description": "We must always in our walks with Jesus Christ keep our eyes on the Lord and seek to please Him alone. The fact is that we belong to Jesus Christ. He has redeemed us with His precious blood and therefore we are not our own.272 This is a liberating truth if we can realize that all we do is in the clear view of God and therefore seek His approval alone. The early Church walked in the fear of the Lord273 and did not seek the accolades and esteem of men. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Then the Church throughout Judea, Galilee and Samaria enjoyed a time of peace and was strengthened. Living in the fear of the Lord and encouraged by the Holy Spirit, it increased in numbers.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d",

This is very much like the account of the Book of Acts where it says the Church was: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Praising God and enjoying the favor of all the people. And the Lord added to their number daily those who were being saved.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d771 In some cases, when they have meetings where there are no stories of a conversion they examine what they have done wrong to hinder the Lord working. Such growth has happened in the last 30 years to where many say conservative estimates put the size of the Iranian house Churches at over one million people.",

WE are just coming to the most beautiful season of the year \u2014 the spring, when everything around us is shaking off the chill grave clothes of winter, and putting on the beautiful array of a new life. The church of God was in that condition at Pentecost, her winter was past, and the flowers appeared on the earth. She enjoyed the spring breezes, for the breath of the Holy Spirit refreshed her garden: there was spring music \u2014 the time of the singing of birds was come, for her preachers testified faithfully of Jesus, and so many and varied were the sweet notes which welcomed the new season, that many nations of men heard in their own tongue the wonderful works of God. There was, also, the spring blossoming, the fig tree put forth her green figs, and the vines with the tender grapes gave a good smell, for all around multitudes inquired, \u201cMen and brethren, what must we do?\u201d and many also avowed their faith in Jesus. There were the spring showers of repentance, the spring sun-gleams of joy in the Holy Ghost and the spring flowers of newly-given hope and faith. May we behold just such another spring time in all the churches of Jesus Christ throughout the world, and meanwhile let us arouse ourselves suitable to so gladsome a season. Let us rise up and meet the Well-Beloved ...",

Today some churches still have the tradition to hold this type of feast where the people bring thanksgiving gifts to God. A little boy was present at one of these offerings, and when the others brought their thanksgiving gifts, he realised that he had nothing to give to Jesus. Suddenly he got a bright idea, rushed to the front and got into the gifts basket, saying, \"Lord Jesus, I haven't got anything; but I give myself to you\". This is a sermon to each one of us.",
