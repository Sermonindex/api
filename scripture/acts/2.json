There is a great benefit at times in having a building where the Lord\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s people can meet in and use for the ministry of the Gospel. Yet, when we look at the Book of Acts, we find no visible record that the Church built buildings. Though they met in some physical locations such as Solomon\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Colonnade113 and the hall of Tyrannus for even two years!114 Yet, this was not the common practice of how saints met across the rest of God\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Churches. Even when looking carefully in Church history it is hard to find evidence of a building being used until 300 AD when pagan temples were being converted into churches under the reign of Constantine.",

Not just a few but all the disciples242 were gripped with the burden to reach the whole known world with this message of eternal life.",

And the Lord added to their number daily those who were being saved.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d771 In some cases, when they have meetings where there are no stories of a conversion they examine what they have done wrong to hinder the Lord working.

SPURGEON, AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON. \u201cAnd the Lord added to the church daily such as should be saved.\u201d\u2014 Acts 2:47. WE are just coming to the most beautiful season of the year \u2014 the spring, when everything around us is shaking off the chill grave clothes of winter, and putting on the beautiful array of a new life. The church of God was in that condition at Pentecost, her winter was past, and the flowers appeared on the earth. She enjoyed the spring breezes, for the breath of the Holy Spirit refreshed her garden: there was spring music \u2014 the time of the singing of birds was come, for her preachers testified faithfully of Jesus, and so many and varied were the sweet notes which welcomed the new season, that many nations of men heard in their own tongue the wonderful works of God. There was, also, the spring blossoming, the fig tree put forth her green figs, and the vines with the tender grapes gave a good smell, for all around multitudes inquired, \u201cMen and brethren, what must we do?\u201d and many also avowed their faith in Jesus. There were the spring showers of repentance, the spring sun-gleams of joy in the Holy Ghost and the spring flowers of newly-given hope and faith.

Was a Christian missionary, teacher, writer, and advocate of economic development in impoverished nations. A spiritual crisis during this period\u2014as he described two decades later in what is probably his best-known recorded teaching, \"Ten Shekels and a Shirt\"--left Reidhead with the conviction that much of evangelicalism had adopted utilitarian and humanistic philosophies contradictory to Biblical teaching. The end of all being, he came to believe, was not the happiness of man, but the glorification of God. This theme would recur throughout his later teaching.\r\n\r\nSince Mr. Reidhead's death in 1992, Bible Teaching Ministries, Inc. continues under the leadership of his wife, Marjorie, and daughter, Virginia Teitt, a dedicated Board, and the many people who have donated time and talent after being changed by God\u2019s Word through this message.
