He has raised up many pastors who are a part of the Calvary Chapel movement now and where he pastors the large Costa Mesa church in California.\r\n\r\nThe Calvary Chapel movement is based of simple principles that Chuck Smith taught over the years such as: The priority of agape love, Simple fellowship amongst the saints, the breaking of bread, the teaching of God's word chapter by chapter and verse by verse.

Recently, we heard of a pastor of a church in America who felt led of the Lord to appoint 12 pastors in his Church who would oversee 12 separate home Churches on Wednesday nights. They all still meet together on Sunday mornings to hear the main pastor teach, but these small groups also act as functioning Churches. These pastors of the small groups are perhaps not as well-trained or capable from a human perspective but this servant leader saw the heart of God to raise up brothers and sisters, to encourage and lead the body of Christ.",

From John 3:16, Matthew 20:28, Acts 20:35, he asks us to note four truths: 1) the father gave his Son, 2) the Son gave his life, 3) they did so in order that we might be ransomed, and 4) it is more blessed to give than to receive. Dr. Tozer then considers who we might want to thank some day for the gifts that they gave to Jesus. The wise men gave gold (lasting treasure), frankincense (worship), and myrrh (bitter sacrifice); Mary gave her mortal body; Joseph gave his faith; the shepherds gave their reverent wonder; Lazarus and his sisters, Mary and Martha, gave the welcome of their home; the women following Jesus gave a seamless, linen robe; and Joseph of Arimathaea gave his own, new grave. These are the gifts that they gave to Jesus. What might we give him that we might not be outdone in giving?",

SPURGEON, AT EXETER HALL, STRAND. \u201cServing the Lord with all humility of mind.\u201d \u2014 Acts 20:19. IT is not often that a man may safely speak about his own humility. Humble men are mostly conscious of great pride, while those who are boastful of humility have nothing but false pretense, and really lack and want it. I question whether any of us are at all judges as to our pride or humility; for verily, pride so often assumes the shape of lowliness when it hath its own end to serve, and lowliness on the other hand is so perfectly compatible with a heavenly dignity of decision, that it is not easy at all times to discover which is the counterfeit and which is the precious and genuine coin. You will remember that in the case in our text, Paul speaks by inspiration. If it were not for this fact, I would not have believed even Paul himself when he spoke of his own humility. So distrustful do I feel of our judgment upon this point, that if he had not spoken under the infallible witness and guidance of the Holy Spirit, I should have said that the text was not true, and that when a man should say he served God with humbleness of mind, speaking merely from his own judgment, there was clear proof before you that he was a proud man. But Paul speaketh not to his own commendation, but with the sole motive of clearing his hands of the blood of all men.",

He explains how the wolves operate, seeking the weak, the naive, or the injured in the church, and how dangerous they are to the Body of Christ. Have a pad and pen handy, he goes through many scriptures, which will enlighten and exhort every believer. A warning every believer needs to hear, especially new believers.",
