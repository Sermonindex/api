            "description": "The premise is from Acts 21 where Paul was counseled away from going to various places by the church, when it was in fact God's will, and then he shares incredible testimony's from the lives of brothers like Jim Elliott, David Livingstone, CT Studd and others who followed the calling of the Lord despite the opposition they faced.  Towards the end, he gives a powerful plea and exhortation to his own church, and poses the question, :Are we going to be a church that stops the mission of Christ or Obeys it?",

We are all resistant to change especially when it involves what we perceive to be hardship or loss to ourselves or someone we love. There is nothing in us that wants to gravitate toward difficulty. In the western world we have formed a Christian theological perspective that avoids difficulty, which results in an anemic Christianity. When we get a word from the Lord that sometimes doesn't make sense to the natural mind, we must be careful to who and what we listen to. There are well meaning people all along our journey that will unknowingly try to break your heart of obedience. God call us to a radical obedience where we will go where you lead us no matter what the cost! When we learn to walk in the ways of God and follow the voice of God the miraculous is released in our lives. Are you willing to respond to the Lord with, \u201chere I am Lord, send me\u201d?",
