Towards the end, he gives a powerful plea and exhortation to his own church, and poses the question, :Are we going to be a church that stops the mission of Christ or Obeys it?",

Dr. David Platt is the pastor of The Church at Brook Hills, a congregation in Birmingham, Alabama. David\u2019s first love in ministry is disciple making\u2014teaching God\u2019s Word, mentoring others, and multiplying the gospel. \u201cI believe that God has uniquely created every one of his people to impact the world,\u201d he says. \u201cSome may count this view as idealistic, but I believe it is thoroughly biblical\u2014rooted in Psalm 67:1\u20132, yet found in Scripture from beginning to end. God is in the business of blessing his people so that his ways and his salvation might be made known among all people.\u201d To this end, David has traveled throughout the United States and around the world, teaching the Bible and training church leaders.\r\nDavid has earned two undergraduate degrees from the University of Georgia and three advanced degrees, including a doctor of philosophy from New Orleans Baptist Theological Seminary. Prior to coming to Brook Hills, he served the seminary as dean of chapel and assistant professor of expository preaching and apologetics and was on staff at Edgewater Baptist Church in New Orleans. He is the founder of Radical, a resource ministry, dedicated to serving the church in making disciples of all nations. For more resources visit the media centre on the Radical website.",

We are all resistant to change especially when it involves what we perceive to be hardship or loss to ourselves or someone we love. There is nothing in us that wants to gravitate toward difficulty. In the western world we have formed a Christian theological perspective that avoids difficulty, which results in an anemic Christianity. When we get a word from the Lord that sometimes doesn't make sense to the natural mind, we must be careful to who and what we listen to. There are well meaning people all along our journey that will unknowingly try to break your heart of obedience. God call us to a radical obedience where we will go where you lead us no matter what the cost! When we learn to walk in the ways of God and follow the voice of God the miraculous is released in our lives. Are you willing to respond to the Lord with, \u201chere I am Lord, send me\u201d?",
