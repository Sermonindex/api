            "description": "November 8, 2009 - The evidence that we are true Christians is a deep seated understanding that no matter what fiery trial God allows us to go through we understand that He is in absolute control and that there is a divine plan behind all of it. It is through these fiery trials that we come out with an inner strength that declares mo matter what happens the life of God in us cannot be triumphed over! The key to this kind of life is to be free of offence and to have a good conscience towards God and man and to refuse to speak evil in a difficult situation. It doesn't matter how we feel or what happens, we must always allow the Holy Spirit to lead us back in line with the truth of God's Word. Do you want to stand in the fire? Your strength comes from allowing God's Word to have the last say in every circumstance!",
