            "description": "February 22, 2009 - When there is not an honest seeking of God the church will begin to turn inward and lose her focus on Christ and become a counterfeit religious system with no answer. True value is not in embracing the things of this world but embracing the life of Christ and doing what He has called us to do. In these last days God will bring the truth of Christ back into focus through His church. When this religious system sees the children of God who are empowered by the Holy Spirit and walking in the joy of Jesus, then many will turn back to the Lord in this generation. Religion will forever bend its knee when there is a God-gripped people in the midst.",
