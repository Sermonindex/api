He has raised up many pastors who are a part of the Calvary Chapel movement now and where he pastors the large Costa Mesa church in California.\r\n\r\nThe Calvary Chapel movement is based of simple principles that Chuck Smith taught over the years such as: The priority of agape love, Simple fellowship amongst the saints, the breaking of bread, the teaching of God's word chapter by chapter and verse by verse. And lastly and most importantly the principle not by might nor by power but by my spirit saith the Lord.",

Though the messenger may be bound in chains, the message still gets through. Brother Andrew cites Paul's situation in Acts 28:30-31. Even as a prisoner of Rome, the Apostle continued to deliver the message. But once through the \"door,\" could a believer return if he wanted to and still be true to Christ? Could Paul? Could Peter? Could Stephen? Could the martyrs?",

Known in English-speaking countries as Brother Andrew, is a Christian missionary famous for his exploits smuggling Bibles to communist countries in the height of the Cold War, a feat that has earned him the nickname \"God's smuggler\". Brother Andrew studied at the WEC Missionary Training College in Glasgow, Scotland. \r\nIn 1967, he published the first edition of God's Smuggler, written with John and Elizabeth Sherrill. God's Smuggler tells the story of Brother Andrew's early childhood, conversion to Christianity, and adventures as a Bible-smuggler behind the Iron Curtain. It has now sold over 10 million copies in thirty-five languages. After the fall of communism in Europe, Brother Andrew shifted his focus to the Middle East and has worked to strengthen the church in the Islamic world. In the 70s he visited war-torn Lebanon several times, stating that \"global conflict in the end times will focus on Israel and its neighboring countries\".",

One of the final traps of Satan on these Christians is to bite our hands and infuse us with his poisonous logic. It's always been Satan's desire to either have man withdraw his hand from being extended on God's behalf, or to distort the image of God's hand as He is revealed through man's hand. For those of us whose hands have been bitten by the very people God has sent us to help, God is saying DONT GIVE UP. God is calling us to a militant forgiveness so that God's hands will be extended through our hands to reach a fallen world. The weakness in our hands will be strengthened by the resurrected Hands of Jesus Christ.",
