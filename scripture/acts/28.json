When God places us in the body and we choose to stay in that position without murmuring or complaining we will become a channel for the gospel to flow through us. The Gospel of Jesus Christ is unstoppable. It is only we who preach it or we who live it can hinder the gospel. It is through the spirit of unbelief that the gospel is hindered.",

Though the messenger may be bound in chains, the message still gets through. Brother Andrew cites Paul's situation in Acts 28:30-31. Even as a prisoner of Rome, the Apostle continued to deliver the message. But once through the \"door,\" could a believer return if he wanted to and still be true to Christ? Could Paul? Could Peter? Could Stephen? Could the martyrs?",

            "description": "March 4, 2007 - Satan is terrified of the man or woman who has determined in his or her heart to fulfill the call that God has placed on their lives no matter what the cost. One of the final traps of Satan on these Christians is to bite our hands and infuse us with his poisonous logic. It's always been Satan's desire to either have man withdraw his hand from being extended on God's behalf, or to distort the image of God's hand as He is revealed through man's hand. For those of us whose hands have been bitten by the very people God has sent us to help, God is saying DONT GIVE UP. God is calling us to a militant forgiveness so that God's hands will be extended through our hands to reach a fallen world. The weakness in our hands will be strengthened by the resurrected Hands of Jesus Christ.",
