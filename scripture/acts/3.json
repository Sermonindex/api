God wants us to be the people of prayer, faith, and not seeking glory for ourselves, but to give glory to our Lord Jesus Christ.  Chuck reminds us that God has to prepare a vessel first for the work that He already ordained that should be accomplished for Him.  God first must work in us before He can work through us.",

We have such a blessing and powerful promises in the New Covenant. God shows us through the law that we can't keep it, we can't be obedient, in our own selves, BUT, he made provision for us through the Holy Ghost being sent to empower us, and live the life of Christ in us, and working mightily through and in us to make us what God wants us to be. The image and likeness of Christ. When we give up trying to do things our way, recognize Jesus saved you from your sins, and when you fully submit to the Holy Ghost he will give you dominion over sin, by faith. A wonderful exhortation on the new covenant.",
