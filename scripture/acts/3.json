Chuck reminds us that God has to prepare a vessel first for the work that He already ordained that should be accomplished for Him.  God first must work in us before He can work through us.",

The men and women that God uses believe in His promises and stand in faith upon those promises.  Paul reminds us in the Epistle to Romans that it is God who gives us a measure of faith (Romans 12:3).  The men and women that God uses are people of faith.",

The disciples prayed for a successor after Judas died.286 Peter prayed for the lame man at the temple gate.287 Stephen prayed for his persecutors when he was being martyred.288 Prayer was the main activity of the Church. Ananias was praying when God directed him to anoint one of the early key leaders of the Church.289 Peter the Apostle was praying when God directed him to preach the Gospel to the Gentiles.",

The image and likeness of Christ. When we give up trying to do things our way, recognize Jesus saved you from your sins, and when you fully submit to the Holy Ghost he will give you dominion over sin, by faith.
