The Church was birthed in prayer. It was sustained in prayer. When they were persecuted they called a prayer meeting.285 Prayer was the beginning of the great commission. The disciples prayed for a successor after Judas died.286 Peter prayed for the lame man at the temple gate.287 Stephen prayed for his persecutors when he was being martyred.288 Prayer was the main activity of the Church. Ananias was praying when God directed him to anoint one of the early key leaders of the Church.289 Peter the Apostle was praying when God directed him to preach the Gospel to the Gentiles.",

If a believer is not overcoming 100% in a specific area, or is partaking in some worldly activity, one may judge and claim that believer is not saved. Such merely outward judging is not spiritual but an immature and dangerous thing to do. Of course, if a believer is blatantly continuing in outward sin he must be dealt with in gentleness and love. As God taught us through the Book of Acts and Epistles of Paul, corrective measures as determined by the Holy Spirit might be necessary. This may include asking a believer to leave the Assembly for a period of time.",

We will stand before a Holy God and everything that is dark will be brought into the light of Christ. Jesus Christ has made every provision for us to live a life of purity. God wants to bury our sin and old nature so that we may live in the fear of God. We can choose to bury our sins today or our sins will bury us tomorrow. It time to get real with God!",

            "description": "A SERMON DELIVERED ON SABBATH MORNING, AUGUST 15, 1858, BY THE REV. C. H. SPURGEON, AT THE MUSIC HALL, ROYAL SURREY GARDENS. \u201cNeither is there salvation in any other: for there is none other name under heaven given among men, whereby we must be saved.\u201d \u2014 Acts 4:12. IT is a very happy circumstance when the servants of God are able to turn everything to account in their ministry. Now, the apostle Peter was summoned before the priests and Sadducees, the chief of his nation, to answer for having restored a man who was lame from his mother's womb. Whilst accounting for this case of cure, or, if I may use the expression, for this case of temporal salvation, the apostle Peter had this thought suggested to him, \u201cWhile I am accounting for the salvation of this man from lameness, I have now a fine opportunity of showing to these people, who otherwise will not listen to us, the way of the salvation of the soul.\u201d So he proceeds from the less to the greater, from the healing of a man's limb to the healing of a man's spirit; and having informed them once that it was through the name of Jesus Christ that the impotent man had been made whole, he now announces that salvation, \u2014 the great salvation, must be wrought by the selfsame means; \u201cNeither is there salvation in any other: for there is none other name under heaven given among men, whereby we must be saved.\u201d What a great word that word \u201csalvation\u201d is!...",
