He has raised up many pastors who are a part of the Calvary Chapel movement now and where he pastors the large Costa Mesa church in California.\r\n\r\nThe Calvary Chapel movement is based of simple principles that Chuck Smith taught over the years such as: The priority of agape love, Simple fellowship amongst the saints, the breaking of bread, the teaching of God's word chapter by chapter and verse by verse.

Yet in almost every Christian circle and denomination, there is an emphasis upon building the church, not that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153the body of Christ may be built up\u00e2\u20ac\u009d112 but rather the building of an actual structure that we refer to commonly as the church. There is a great benefit at times in having a building where the Lord\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s people can meet in and use for the ministry of the Gospel. Yet, when we look at the Book of Acts, we find no visible record that the Church built buildings. Though they met in some physical locations such as Solomon\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Colonnade113 and the hall of Tyrannus for even two years!114 Yet, this was not the common practice of how saints met across the rest of God\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Churches. Even when looking carefully in Church history it is hard to find evidence of a building being used until 300 AD when pagan temples were being converted into churches under the reign of Constantine.",

The Iranians believe that Jesus Christ is with them in their small gatherings and therefore there is a confidence that they are meeting as a Church even if there are just a few believers present. They count it a necessity to network with others and consider themselves all part of one Church. There is no choice to try to find a different church for doctrinal preference or worship style; all believers are content to meet simply with each other.",

We will stand before a Holy God and everything that is dark will be brought into the light of Christ. Jesus Christ has made every provision for us to live a life of purity.

If you want a bitter sneer, a biting sarcasm, or a cruel action, I commend you to these large-minded gentlemen. They are liberal to everybody, except to those who hold the truth; and for those they have a reserve of concentrated bitterness which far excels wormwood and gall. They are so liberal to their brother errorists, that they have no tolerance to spare for evangelicals. We are expressly told that \u201cthe high priest, and all they that were with him (which is the sect of the Sadducees,) were filled with indignation.\u201d That which had been done deserved their admiration, but received their indignation. Such gentlemen as these can be warm at a very short notice, when the doctrine of the cross is spreading, and God the Holy Spirit is bearing witness with signs following. Let them display their indignation, it is according to their nature. To them the only answer which God gave was spoken by his angel...",
