The early Church walked in the fear of the Lord273 and did not seek the accolades and esteem of men. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Then the Church throughout Judea, Galilee and Samaria enjoyed a time of peace and was strengthened. Living in the fear of the Lord and encouraged by the Holy Spirit, it increased in numbers.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d",

It is accepted as the will of God at times to suffer601 and to even expect severe persecution. This type of suffering produces a joy602 and sense of privilege that they are willing to identify with their precious Lord who has saved them.",
