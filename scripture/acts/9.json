It is accepted as the will of God at times to suffer601 and to even expect severe persecution. This type of suffering produces a joy602 and sense of privilege that they are willing to identify with their precious Lord who has saved them.",

This theme would recur throughout his later teaching.\r\n\r\nSince Mr. Reidhead's death in 1992, Bible Teaching Ministries, Inc. continues under the leadership of his wife, Marjorie, and daughter, Virginia Teitt, a dedicated Board, and the many people who have donated time and talent after being changed by God\u2019s Word through this message.
