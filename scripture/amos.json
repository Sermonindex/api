            "description": "Israel in the 8th century B.C. was self-satisfied; her churches were full; her people were religious; there was a great deal of activity in her midst; and she believed her material prosperity was evidence of God's favor. But God and His Word had been forgotten, His law forsaken, and His loving grace taken for granted. Instead of the name of the Lord, Israel ran into two towers \u2013 their homes and their temples \u2013 prosperity and religion \u2013 and God promised to destroy both. Once any people begin to amass expensive homes, power over other people, and large incomes, it is easy for them to find their identity in these things. There is a natural tendency for people to consider their security to be in their stuff. They will go to great extremes to protect that which they imagine themselves to have gained by right \u2013 and anything that would threaten their power or their status or their revenue \u2013 they will act even in immoral ways to maintain what they presume to be rightfully their own.  Are we not falling into the same trap? Why should God not sweep away our western materialistic churches?",

They have a love of pleasure more than a love for God. 1. What it means to be at ease in Zion. 2. The tragic effects of being at ease. 3. The judgement awaiting those at ease. 4. The importance of stirring oneself out of spiritual complacency. Five tests for music: 1. Can you hear the Word of God clearly over the music? 2. Does the music enlarge my vision of the glory of God? 3. Will what I'm listening to produce the fruit of holiness in my life? 4. Does the music communicate sound biblical doctrine? 5. Does the music tend to sedate the mind and make it insensible to God's truth? Contemporary Christian Music (CCM):  Amusing Grace, how sensual the sound, that entertained a seeker like me. I once was lost, but now I'm amused; was blind but now I'm deceived.",

If we desire to hear God's voice we have to hear the whole package, the provision of God and the cry of God for the helplessness of humanity. We must offer all that we are so that God's heart would be satisfied in the earth. If you are willing to be given for others you will know and hear the voice of Jesus. The question is, \"will you give your all for the glory of God\"?",

            "description": "THESE two questions are evidently Oriental proverbial expressions. Proverbs have always been used by the wisest of men. Solomon not only spoke and wrote a great many, but he also made a considerable collection of those uttered by others. We find, in the writings of such notable thinkers as Socrates, and Pliny, and Aristotle, an abundance of short, pithy sentences, many of which can be used as proverbs. Proverbs have great force in them, because they are condensed wisdom. They are generally most convincing; it is hardly ever possible to answer or controvert them. They carry truth home as an arrow has often been known to carry death to the person aimed at, for they strike, they stick, they penetrate, they wound. Our Lord Jesus very frequently made use of proverbs; nor was he singular in so doing. The prophets of old constantly employed them; and here, in our text, we see Amos, \u2014 who, from his occupation as a herdsman and gatherer of sycamore fruit, was probably more familiar with their use than some others of the prophets were, \u2014 puts together two proverbs which were commonly used to signify that men do not, as a rule, continue to labor in vain, and spend their strength for nought.",
