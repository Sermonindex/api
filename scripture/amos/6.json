            "description": "There are people who profess to know Christ yet they live carelessly. They do not deny biblical truth, it is simply neglected in their lives. They have a love of pleasure more than a love for God. 1. What it means to be at ease in Zion. 2. The tragic effects of being at ease. 3. The judgement awaiting those at ease. 4. The importance of stirring oneself out of spiritual complacency. Five tests for music: 1. Can you hear the Word of God clearly over the music? 2. Does the music enlarge my vision of the glory of God? 3. Will what I'm listening to produce the fruit of holiness in my life? 4. Does the music communicate sound biblical doctrine? 5. Does the music tend to sedate the mind and make it insensible to God's truth? Contemporary Christian Music (CCM):  Amusing Grace, how sensual the sound, that entertained a seeker like me. I once was lost, but now I'm amused; was blind but now I'm deceived.",

            "description": "'Woe to those that are at ease in Zion!' is the cry that goes out from Amos the prophet of God to the people of God, here in Amos the people of God were even looking for the coming of the Lord, like the church today, and yet Amos says @woah to you!'  Pastor Legge puts forward the frightening but necessary question can we be sure of our salvation and walk with God if we are at ease with a dormant church and a dying world all around us.  Have we forgotten that the Gospel is an offence and a stumbling block and shouldn't be sugar coated in order to administer to people, we are to be about our Fathers business like our Lord, David just before he slew Goliath asked the terrified men around him 'Is there not a cause?' \r\n\r\n[i]All material by Pastor Legge is copyrighted.

            "description": "THESE two questions are evidently Oriental proverbial expressions. Proverbs have always been used by the wisest of men. Solomon not only spoke and wrote a great many, but he also made a considerable collection of those uttered by others. We find, in the writings of such notable thinkers as Socrates, and Pliny, and Aristotle, an abundance of short, pithy sentences, many of which can be used as proverbs. Proverbs have great force in them, because they are condensed wisdom. They are generally most convincing; it is hardly ever possible to answer or controvert them. They carry truth home as an arrow has often been known to carry death to the person aimed at, for they strike, they stick, they penetrate, they wound. Our Lord Jesus very frequently made use of proverbs; nor was he singular in so doing. The prophets of old constantly employed them; and here, in our text, we see Amos, \u2014 who, from his occupation as a herdsman and gatherer of sycamore fruit, was probably more familiar with their use than some others of the prophets were, \u2014 puts together two proverbs which were commonly used to signify that men do not, as a rule, continue to labor in vain, and spend their strength for nought.",
