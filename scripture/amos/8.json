            "description": "Only 6-9% of American Christians are now believing that the Bible is infallible and that Jesus Christ is the only way. The Church has sinned, we have sinned, not living and \"doing\" the word of God.  American true Christians are officially classified with extremists in the class of terrorists by the FBI and Homeland Security in the USA. True Christians love their enemies and do good yet we are starting to be hated. Jesus said this would happen. America and Canada are killing the unborn on an altar of lust. It is the greatest genocide in human history.",

Jesus longs to reveal Himself to His church and with that revelation will come the knowledge of His burden for the lost. If we desire to hear God's voice we have to hear the whole package, the provision of God and the cry of God for the helplessness of humanity. We must offer all that we are so that God's heart would be satisfied in the earth. If you are willing to be given for others you will know and hear the voice of Jesus. The question is, \"will you give your all for the glory of God\"?",
