Any 2-3 brothers or sisters can meet in this way and start to allow the Lord to mature their gathering. We must have the simplicity of faith that our Gathering is unto Him and not for ourselves. Early Christians met together with a great joy at times because they were gathering with others who have been redeemed by the precious blood of Jesus Christ. So Jesus Christ Himself was the center of their unity. These simple guidelines combine many of the Principles found in the Principles for the Gathering of Believers volume.",

            "description": "I was making mention of an article in Time magazine the other day where churchmen of different churches and of great renown were expressing themselves about the conditions in the world, and what place the church held, and the preaching of the gospel.  They said very nice things, but all of them missed the main thing.  We have \u00e2\u20ac\u0153turned to God from idols\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 to wait for His Son from heaven.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d  Every Christian\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s job and responsibility is to prepare the way for the coming of the Lord Jesus Christ.  \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This is life eternal, that they might know Thee the only true God, and Jesus Christ whom Thou hast sent.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d  But you cannot know \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Jesus Christ whom He has sent\u00e2\u20ac\u009d until you experience Him\u00e2\u20ac\u201duntil you live Him, praise God!\u00e2\u20ac\u201duntil He takes over.",

A spiritual crisis during this period\u2014as he described two decades later in what is probably his best-known recorded teaching, \"Ten Shekels and a Shirt\"--left Reidhead with the conviction that much of evangelicalism had adopted utilitarian and humanistic philosophies contradictory to Biblical teaching. The end of all being, he came to believe, was not the happiness of man, but the glorification of God. This theme would recur throughout his later teaching.\r\n\r\nSince Mr. Reidhead's death in 1992, Bible Teaching Ministries, Inc. continues under the leadership of his wife, Marjorie, and daughter, Virginia Teitt, a dedicated Board, and the many people who have donated time and talent after being changed by God\u2019s Word through this message.

Paul Washer said he was one of the most godly men he met in Canada.\r\n\r\nBill Mcleod had been praying and had his congregation praying for revival for years. On, October 17, 1971, God in His sovereignty came in revival. Without human means or explanation, the revival spread from church to church, community to community, city to city, and not long after from province to province. This has become known as the 1971 Canadian Revival movement.",

            "description": "The cross at Golgotha is where the greatest battle ever was fought. Not one demon was absent when this battle was fought. It was such a fierce battle that even the sun hid its face and there was darkness on earth. Rocks were rent asunder. Satan tried his level best to overthrow the Lord Jesus Christ. Satan was an angel of the north walking among the others in heaven, until pride was found in him and he was thrown out of heaven (Is 14:12-14). A third of the angels in heaven joined satan in his rebellion and was cast out of heaven with him (Rev 12:3-4; 7-9). One cannot grasp it. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s unthinkable that a third of the angel should side with satan. But if one looks at people, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s maybe understandable, when so many people side with satan.",

Many other things we might give thee warning of (gentle Reader) if we had not exceeded the measure of a Preface already. It remaineth, that we commend thee to God, and to the Spirit of his grace, which is able to build further than we can ask or think. He removeth the scales from our eyes, the vail from our hearts, opening our wits that we may understand his word, enlarging our hearts, yea correcting our affections, that we may love it to the end. Ye are brought unto fountains of living water which ye digged not; do not cast earth into them with the Philistines, neither prefer broken pits before them with the wicked Jews. [Gen 26:15. Jer 2:13.] Others have laboured, and you may enter into their labours; O receive not so great things in vain, O despise not so great salvation! Be not like swine to tread under foot so precious things, neither yet like dogs to tear and abuse holy things. Say not to our Saviour with the Gergesites, Depart out of our coast [Matt 8:34]; neither yet with Esau sell your birthright for a mess of pottage [Heb 12:16]. If light be come into the world, love not darkness more than light; if food, if clothing be offered, go not naked, starve not yourselves. Remember the advice of Nazianzene, \"It is a grievous thing\" (or dangerous) \"to neglect a great fair, and to seek to make markets afterwards:\" also the encouragement of S. Chrysostom, \"It is altogether impossible, that he that is sober\" (and watchful) \"should at any time be neglected:\" [S. Chrysost. in epist. ad Rom. cap. 14. oral. 26.]\r\nLastly, the admonition and menacing of S. Augustine, \"They that despise God's will inviting them, shall feel God's will taking vengeance of them.\" [S. August. ad artic. sibi falso object. Artic. 16.] It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God; [Heb 10:31] but a blessed thing it is, and will bring us to everlasting blessedness in the end, when God speaketh unto us, to hearken; when he setteth his word before us, to read it; when he stretcheth out his hand and calleth, to answer, Here am I, here we are to do thy will, O God. The Lord work a care and conscience in us to know him and serve him, that we may be acknowledged of him at the appearing of our Lord Jesus Christ, to whom with the holy Ghost, be all praise and thanksgiving.

Spurgeon, \"Jesus bears not the cross so that you may escape it, but that you may endure it,\" this sermon delivers a message which adopts and adheres the previous two messages into our own bearing of the cross.  It is stated herein that one of the greatest libels against the cross in our day is the idea that the believer in the cross is absented from any form of suffering.  It is the cruciform life which will generate a necessary friction against the kingdoms of this world.  We must apprehend that this conflict is an intention of God through his people, and in every sense, a diet of the things of this world will by nature slicken any apprehension of this cross-centered friction.   The hearing of this sermon in its deepest of intentions will bring you face to face with Jesus calling you Satan, that is to say...you are Satanic if you cherish not the things of God over the things of man. We are admonished to take up the cross and follow Christ for, \"Natural man is always the instrument by which Satanic things are brought into being in the collision between kingdoms.\"",

This text is an inspiration to every believer. The challenge is that the world is in our hands. If we repent and get right with God, our land will be healed and restored. We are not to point to the sin of other people but to ourselves and if we repent the Lord will heal our land. God requires that we humble ourselves.
