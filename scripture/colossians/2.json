The cross liberates us, the blood cleanses us from sin, and frees us from the law. The liberty of the New Covenant is freedom from sin, and bondage of striving in our flesh to be holy. Jesus refers to children in Matt 18, and warns against offending new Christians. We must allow the Holy Spirit to teach them, as we love them and pray for them. This is one of the best messages I've heard on the new covenant and the righteousness of Christ imputed to believers.",

God speaks directly to his people, not the gentiles but to the believers. \"If my people return to me and humble themselves, they will receive forgiveness of sin.\" God sees the sin and if people repent of their sin, God will heal their land. This text is an inspiration to every believer. The challenge is that the world is in our hands. If we repent and get right with God, our land will be healed and restored. We are not to point to the sin of other people but to ourselves and if we repent the Lord will heal our land. God requires that we humble ourselves. This word was said to Solomon where God said, \"If my people will humble themselves and turn from their wicked ways, I will heal the land.\" Things can be turned around if people have an ear to hear what God says.",
