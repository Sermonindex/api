It was such a fierce battle that even the sun hid its face and there was darkness on earth. Rocks were rent asunder. Satan tried his level best to overthrow the Lord Jesus Christ. Satan was an angel of the north walking among the others in heaven, until pride was found in him and he was thrown out of heaven (Is 14:12-14). A third of the angels in heaven joined satan in his rebellion and was cast out of heaven with him (Rev 12:3-4; 7-9). One cannot grasp it. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s unthinkable that a third of the angel should side with satan. But if one looks at people, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s maybe understandable, when so many people side with satan.",

This text is an inspiration to every believer. The challenge is that the world is in our hands. If we repent and get right with God, our land will be healed and restored. We are not to point to the sin of other people but to ourselves and if we repent the Lord will heal our land. God requires that we humble ourselves.
