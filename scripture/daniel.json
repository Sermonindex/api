            "description": "Daniel's vision in chapter 7 was probably chronologically between Daniel chaoters 4 and 5.  In this vision the lion depicts the empire of Babylon that overwhelmed it's enemies like a lion overwhelms it's prey, but this lion was brought low and humbled just like Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon.  The bear depicts the Medo-Persian empire that was slower in conquest than the Babylonian empire but was very crushing in the way it dominated it's enemies, inerestingly Daniel says this beast was raised up on one side and this is because the Persians were more dominant than the Medes' in the alliance.  The third beast is a four winged leopard which shows speed this beast depicts the greek empire under Alexander the great that conquered most of the known world in just 12 years, the beast also has 4 heads and Alexander divided his kingdom between his 4 generals.  The forth beast is different to all other beasts and represents the roman empire, however this beast hasn't been completely destroyed and is still around in the form of the European Union from which David Guzik believes the anitchrist (little horn in this chapter) will arise.  The final empire is the reign of Christ after his scond coming, this kingdom Jesus will give to his saints, notice it is given to them not earned by them.",

            "description": "the Eigth chapter of Daniel is a passage in the Bible so outstanding in it's historical fulfillment that many liberal scholars think that it could not possibly have been written by Daniel because it reveals future events in such detail.  The ram's horns represent the kings of Media and Persia.  The goat represents the grecian empire and it's one mighty horn Alexander the great, who split his kingdom into 4 parts at his death at the age of only 32 years old. Out of these 4 rulers arose 1 called Antiochus Epiphanes who behaved abhorently towards the jews, he defiled the temple by erecting a statue of Zeus and slaughtering a pig on the altar, he was also responsible for the murder of possibly 100,000 Jews, and is called by many comentators'the antichrist of the Old Testament'.  The cultural influence of the greek empire was massive though, and still greatly influences modern thought even more than 2000 years later.  The hand of the Lord was in this huge influence of greek thinking though in that by the time Jesus came to the world the whole of civilization spoke one language, greek, and hence Paul could go anywhere in the civilized world and preach in greek and be understood.",

            "description": "Daniel saw a great vision of a man clothed very much like the Lord Jesus at the start of Revelation. In this passage we read of an angel coming to Daniel to answer his prayer on the very day that Daniel lifted his hands up to the Lord God , yet this angel was resisted and hindered by demonic forces within the spirit realm, thus the answer didn't get through to Daniel till the 21st day, this is a great lesson in persistent and prevailing prayer as the answer would not have come to Daniel if he had given up on the 19th day, the angelic messenger was of course helped by Micheal who seems to have a protective role over the nation of Israel.  In the prophetic vision that is revealed to Daniel the king of the north is the king of Syria and the king of the south the king of Egypt, historically these 2 kings were 2 of Alexander the greats generals which have been mentioned before, and Israel was caught inbetween their disputes, this was just before the reign of Antiochus, the antichristn of the Old Testament.",

Daniel is moved by what he reads and begins to intercede for the his people, he prays that the Lord would take this 70 years from the first move into captivity in 605BC and not 597BC.  Daniel was the 'chief of staff' for Babylon and still had time to pray in this incredible way, he set his face to seek the Lord and begn to repent for the sins of Israel and he begged the Lord to turn away His anger from His people and for the sake of His own righteousness restore His people.  The Lord answered Daniel's prayer.",

By this time Daniel was probably around 80 years old and yet still had faultless integrity to the degree that the enemies of this man of God couldn't find any skeletons in his closet even after more than 50 years in civil service.  They came to the conclusion that they would only trap Daniel because of his faithfulness to God, so they got Darius to pass a decree that no one should pray to any god except him for 30 days. In the face of this Daniel did the safest thing he could.. exactly what he had always done and stayed faithful to God.  For this Daniel was condemned to be cast into the den of lions, the night he was in the den Darius neither slept nor ate, Daniel prayed as it was his custom to pray 3 times a day.  We find that in this remarkable occasion Daniel was kept due to his habitual lifestyle, he remained faithful to God and the Lord blessed him for it.",

The prophecy laid out here will have it's fulfillment in the end times, it will be a period of 3 and a half years and will be so intense that it will cause the people of Israel to cry out to their Messiah and He will return and defend them from the last onslaught.  Interestingly Pastor Guzik says that 'running to and fro and knowledge shall increase' speaks of the huge explosion in understanding of Biblical prophecy that has occured in the past 100 years.",

            "description": "In this chapter of scripture Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, has a dream that deeply disturbs him, and calls for his wisemen to council him about it,  however he wisely also asks them to describe the dream to him then he will know that their interpretation is correct.  The wisemen couldn't answer so the king orders for all his councilers to be executed.  When the captain of the guard arrives at Daniels house, Daniel bravely asks for time to seek the God of Heaven in order to tell the king what he desires to know, the king gives him time and the Lord gives Daniel the answer, so Daniel reveals the dream and interpretation to the king. The gold head represents the Babylonian empire, the silver arms and chest represent the Medo-Persian empire, the bronze belly represents the Greek empire, the Iron legs the Roman empire and the iron and clay feet are yet to be revealed.  One thing is for sure though the Stone not cut with hands that destroys the image is the Lord Jesus whose kingdom will be established forever.",

Daniel was amongst these taken as he was one of the young shining lights of the people of Israel, they were taken so that they might be indctrinated into the Babylonian way of thinking and work for the king in his civil service, of course they were also taken as hostages.  The young men of Israle were given new names, each to do with a Babylonian god, a good education and meat from the kings table, this last thing daniel politely refused as eating such things would have made him spiritually impure.  The refusal to eat the food offered could have carried with it a death sentence but Daniel took the responsability upon himself so as not to endanger the chief eunuch, Daniel and his companions gave themselves to the Lord in a remarkable way and the Lord blessed them in return in a remarkable way.",

This is amazingly characteristic of the abundance with which the Lord gives to His people, Daniel has been asking the Lord to show mercy to the nation of Israel yet the Lord does that and more, He answers Daniel's prayer but goes so much further.  Gabriel reveals to Daniel that there will be a period of 490 years that will concern the Jews and particularly the city of Jerusalem.  The prophecy began to be fulfilled in 445BC at the decree of Cyrus to rebuild the city of Jerusalem.  483 Jewish years (360 days) later was the exact that the Lord Jesus rode into Jerusalem on the donkey, but as predicted the Messiah was executed and the temple destoyed.  So we await the fulfillment of Daniels 70th week, when the Antichrist will confirm a covenant with the jews, his people destroyed the temple and Jerusalem before he even came to the world, many believe he will probably be European.",

Again he has a disturbing dream and calls for his councillors and yet calls Daniel last, and how is this a type of us today, when trouble comes we go to all the ends of the earth seeking council without asking what God has to say about the situation.  In his dream he sees a great tree that provides everything that the world needs, he then sees an angelic being saying 'cut it down'. Everyone knew what this dream meant yet only Daniel probably with a heavy heart and tears in his eyes would tell the king, Daniel implured him to repent yet even through this he didn't and thus fell mightily he probably went mad and for seven years ate grass like an ox.  Interestingly in secular Babylonian history there is a seven year preiod where there were no royal decrees. This passage teaches us that if we do not humble ourselves then God will do it because He will not share His glory with anyone.",

But God decides to 'crash' this party  and manifests a disembodied hand to write on the wall, this terrifies the king and he calls for Daniel to interpret the writing.  This is a type of how the world seek out the children of God when 'the writing is on their walls'.  Belshazzar offers Daniel riches and power but Daniel isn't interested and rebukes Belshazzar saying that he should have humbled himself like Nebuchadnezzar, but because he hadn't the kingdom would be taken from him and divided, and this was fullfilled that very night when Darius' army stormed Babylon",

The three Hebrew men Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego would not bow to the image as it violated the second commandment, they knew the penalty would probably have resulted in their death yet they obeyed God and not man.  They faced tremendous pressure when brought before the king himself and asked if the allegations of their 'betrayel' were true, they stuck to their ground and told him they wouldn't bow and that God could deliver them even out of Nebuchadnezzars hand.  For this they were cast into the firey furnace, here the original text implies that they began to sing and praise the Lord and Nebuchadnezzar saw the Lord Jesus with them in the midst of the fiery trial, there is nothing in the text to shwo that they saw the Lord there, but He was there and the trial only served to release them from their bondage.",

Persecution of the 1st and 2nd centuries phased out as Christianity became universally accepted starting with Constantine (313 AD).  New creeds formed to combat new heresies, but even the biblically based creeds turned into dead orthodoxy, which gave rise to counter movements.  Parkyns outlines gospel developments, monastic orders, and adoption of paganism by the 'official church' in Europe (particularly the British Isles), the rise to preeminence of the bishop of Rome, and a renewed interest in the Church about the coming of the Antichrist.",

            "description": "A brief series of four messages addressing the moral condition of our nation in a focused way. The first message deals with the relationship of God to all the nations, including our own. In this introductory message we see: 1. the subjugation of all the nations to the sovereign rule of God. 2. the accountability of the nations to the just judgment of God. 3. the responsibility of the nations to hear the word of God.  4. the solidarity of believers with the nation in which they are found. Subsequent messages address more pointedly our nations\u2019 sins of bloodguiltiness, sexual perversion and religious apostasy.",

Salvation consists in knowing God.  How many, many people miss it!  How very, very few people in the world know God! You can tell it when you travel through the world and meet with works and ministers.  The great complaint is like it was by the prophet Jeremiah: the priests knew not the Lord.  How differently they would act and live and minister if they knew the Lord!  How different our conventions would turn out if those in charge knew the Lord!  But why don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t we know Him?  Jesus says, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Every one that seeketh findeth.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d  Findeth what?  Why, findeth God. Are we seeking God?  Are we really seeking God?  Then we shall find Him.  God says we shall find Him.  The very principle of faith is to start out with that knowledge: why, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153God is.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d  When you seek for something that you want very badly, you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re not going to give up until you find that thing.",

When the Holy Spirit comes we become aware of the ungodliness of our speech. The closer we get to the presence of Christ the more undone we feel and we are made aware of the grace and mercy that continually covers us. This visitation comes to gives us a heart for the poor and when the Spirit of God is flowing through us spiritual poverty is broken. Christ inside of us will heal us and give us fresh vision of the future.",

The reader does an excellent job preserving the heart of Moody in the delivery. Taken from Daniel 5, the story of the finger writing on the wall 'Mene Mene Tekel Parsin', Moody expounds on how we will all be weighed in the balance of God's Ten Commandments, and our position in Christ will define the outcome. This is a solid sermon revealing further insight into the style and message of the late D.L. Moody.",

We can shut the mouth of the lions when we don\u2019t allow past betrayals, injustice, jealousy and anger keep us from moving forward in Christ. We must get to the point where the devil has nothing more to say to us concerning these areas of pain. We know we are of an excellent spirit when we can bless the hand that God has used to hammer out our character on the anvil. We must understand that we don't grow by having our battles go away. We grow by having our battles finish their intended purposes.",
