            "description": "The time known as 'Jacobs trouble' will be the worst persecution that has ever befallen the jewish people, which is saying a lot considering they have been the target of satanic persecution all along, and we know the reason for this is due to the fact that the jews are so wrapped up in God's eternal plan.In the midst of this time of persecution there will be a great opportunity to spread the gospel though.  The prophecy laid out here will have it's fulfillment in the end times, it will be a period of 3 and a half years and will be so intense that it will cause the people of Israel to cry out to their Messiah and He will return and defend them from the last onslaught.  Interestingly Pastor Guzik says that 'running to and fro and knowledge shall increase' speaks of the huge explosion in understanding of Biblical prophecy that has occured in the past 100 years.",

He introduces the book of Revelation as a love letter from the Bridegroom to the Bride about what to expect, though written in code, to be understood by His Word.  Parkyns sees God behind the scenes of Chuch history, not this net of jumbled doctrines, personalities and heresies as many have portrayed it.",

Because many stars have fallen, the preachers of the Gospel have fallen. Ministers and preachers are being caught in evil things. It is getting dark in the world. It seems as if the sun is indeed going down. It seems as if we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re coming to the end of the world and the end of time. We read that in the last days it will indeed go difficult, and that the powers of heaven will be shaken (Matt 24:29).",

We were barren and withered, dead in our sins, but Jesus came and brought us life. Now we can display the fruits of righteous. The Bible says my heart is full of joyous laughter because I've found salvation through the Lord Jesus. In Hebrews 11 we read of the faith of Abraham and Sarah.",
