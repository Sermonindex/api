            "description": "The time known as 'Jacobs trouble' will be the worst persecution that has ever befallen the jewish people, which is saying a lot considering they have been the target of satanic persecution all along, and we know the reason for this is due to the fact that the jews are so wrapped up in God's eternal plan.In the midst of this time of persecution there will be a great opportunity to spread the gospel though.  The prophecy laid out here will have it's fulfillment in the end times, it will be a period of 3 and a half years and will be so intense that it will cause the people of Israel to cry out to their Messiah and He will return and defend them from the last onslaught.  Interestingly Pastor Guzik says that 'running to and fro and knowledge shall increase' speaks of the huge explosion in understanding of Biblical prophecy that has occured in the past 100 years.",

Willie Mullan had a religious conversion and from that time forward he decided he would strive to serve God.\r\n\r\n In 1953 Willie Mullan was called to Lurgan Baptist church, and in August of that year he commenced the work in Lurgan. One of his great accomplishments during this time was the Tuesday night Bible class. Every Tuesday night hundreds attended to hear the exposition of the Word. In 1957 William Hewitt and a team of helpers commenced the tape recordings of the Bible class. At least 1500 of these recordings remain until this day.",

Because many stars have fallen, the preachers of the Gospel have fallen. Ministers and preachers are being caught in evil things. It is getting dark in the world. It seems as if the sun is indeed going down. It seems as if we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re coming to the end of the world and the end of time.
