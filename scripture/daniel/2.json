The wisemen couldn't answer so the king orders for all his councilers to be executed.  When the captain of the guard arrives at Daniels house, Daniel bravely asks for time to seek the God of Heaven in order to tell the king what he desires to know, the king gives him time and the Lord gives Daniel the answer, so Daniel reveals the dream and interpretation to the king. The gold head represents the Babylonian empire, the silver arms and chest represent the Medo-Persian empire, the bronze belly represents the Greek empire, the Iron legs the Roman empire and the iron and clay feet are yet to be revealed.  One thing is for sure though the Stone not cut with hands that destroys the image is the Lord Jesus whose kingdom will be established forever.",

Persecution of the 1st and 2nd centuries phased out as Christianity became universally accepted starting with Constantine (313 AD).  New creeds formed to combat new heresies, but even the biblically based creeds turned into dead orthodoxy, which gave rise to counter movements.  Parkyns outlines gospel developments, monastic orders, and adoption of paganism by the 'official church' in Europe (particularly the British Isles), the rise to preeminence of the bishop of Rome, and a renewed interest in the Church about the coming of the Antichrist.",
