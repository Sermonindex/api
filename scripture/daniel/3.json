            "description": "The image rasied up by Nebuchadnezzar, was most likely, due to it's dimensions, and obelisk like shape, it was used by the king to test the allegiance of his servants and was most likely a political rather than spiritual device.  The three Hebrew men Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego would not bow to the image as it violated the second commandment, they knew the penalty would probably have resulted in their death yet they obeyed God and not man.  They faced tremendous pressure when brought before the king himself and asked if the allegations of their 'betrayel' were true, they stuck to their ground and told him they wouldn't bow and that God could deliver them even out of Nebuchadnezzars hand.  For this they were cast into the firey furnace, here the original text implies that they began to sing and praise the Lord and Nebuchadnezzar saw the Lord Jesus with them in the midst of the fiery trial, there is nothing in the text to shwo that they saw the Lord there, but He was there and the trial only served to release them from their bondage.",

The two things that turned King Nebuchadnezzar's head were the liberty and the fellowship these saints had with the Son of God.  The good news is that the Christian life will never become more difficult than chapter one--setting one's heart to please God and not defile oneself.",

To face these we must have courage, or spiritual toughness, just as the men in this passage did. Deliverance by God is amazing, and the enemy will sometimes be destroyed by their own methods. The most important thing is always the presence of God in the trial, as he was in the furnace.",
