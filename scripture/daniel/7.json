            "description": "Daniel's vision in chapter 7 was probably chronologically between Daniel chaoters 4 and 5.  In this vision the lion depicts the empire of Babylon that overwhelmed it's enemies like a lion overwhelms it's prey, but this lion was brought low and humbled just like Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon.  The bear depicts the Medo-Persian empire that was slower in conquest than the Babylonian empire but was very crushing in the way it dominated it's enemies, inerestingly Daniel says this beast was raised up on one side and this is because the Persians were more dominant than the Medes' in the alliance.  The third beast is a four winged leopard which shows speed this beast depicts the greek empire under Alexander the great that conquered most of the known world in just 12 years, the beast also has 4 heads and Alexander divided his kingdom between his 4 generals.  The forth beast is different to all other beasts and represents the roman empire, however this beast hasn't been completely destroyed and is still around in the form of the European Union from which David Guzik believes the anitchrist (little horn in this chapter) will arise.  The final empire is the reign of Christ after his scond coming, this kingdom Jesus will give to his saints, notice it is given to them not earned by them.",

Is the book of Revelation speaking of things totally in the future, or are there legitimate evidence from the historical record that indeed show that prophecy has been completed?  Join Edgar Parkyns as he sheds light upon the often mysterious apocalyptic language of prophecy--\"the ten horns\", \"the man of sin\"--and presents these alongside the obvious events of the history of the Church.  You be the judge!",

            "description": "Brother Denny Kenaston shares his burden on the coming persecution that will come in the end times but very possibly soon to Christianity world-wide. He clearly shows biblically that if we are of the kingdom of Christ the kingdom of this world will be in opposition against us. We need to prepare for this and prepare to love our enemies and share the Gospel.",
