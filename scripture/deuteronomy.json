Nations that have been great got corrupted by the inside instead of being conquered from the outside. God ordered that idolatorship worship should result in stoning. That way the nation of Israel was kept pure and towards the One true God so that the nation was persevered. People were to get 2-3 witnesses if something was worshipping an idol and then they were stoned for the punishment. The Nation of Israel was to be an Theocracy which was God who was the King and God ruled over it.

God is an jealous God so we should not tempt God but live towards Him. We should diligently keep the commandments of God and the statutes that it may be well of us. We have to take time to explain things to children because God has given children the power to question and ask questions about God.",

            "description": "Deuteronomy is an rehearsal and an capsulation of the law that Moses had given before. Gods eyesight did not dwindle but at 120 years it was still perfect. God said to Moses that he would not be able to enter into the promised land. God says that Israel is to enter into this land and enter and take cities and peoples greater then them. But before they had the same word from God but they had fear 40 years earlier they had 40 years in the wilderness till the whole generation passed away. God was greater then the greatest obstacle they could face. It is foolish to look at things without for what they are but at the same time we need to look beyond the problems to the sustaining power of God. When we get too close to problems we can lose sight of God. Self righteousness so easily attaches to us, there is something so perverse about our nature is that we want to make people think we are more righteous then we are. We want people to think we are spiritual giants.",

He wants us not living on bread (prosperity) promises alone, but by every promise in the Word of God. To not fully trust God is to strip him of all he wants to be and can be to us and bring him down to the level of a dead idol.

Deut. 32:35 In this verse is threatened the vengeance of God on the wicked unbelieving Israelites, who were God's visible people, and who lived under the means of grace; but who, notwithstanding all God's wonderful works towards them, remained (as ver. 28.) void of counsel, having no understanding in them. Under all the cultivations of heaven, they brought forth bitter and poisonous fruit; as in the two verses next preceding the text. The expression I have chosen for my text, Their foot shall slide in due time, seems to imply the following doings, relating to the punishment and destruction to which these wicked Israelites were exposed.",
