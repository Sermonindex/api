            "description": "What people give to God should not be castoffs. There should not be given something to God that doesn\u2019t cost us but rather something should be given to God that costs us. Jesus watching the mite that gave out of her lively hood and substance he said she gave more then all! Nations that have been great got corrupted by the inside instead of being conquered from the outside. God ordered that idolatorship worship should result in stoning. That way the nation of Israel was kept pure and towards the One true God so that the nation was persevered. People were to get 2-3 witnesses if something was worshipping an idol and then they were stoned for the punishment. The Nation of Israel was to be an Theocracy which was God who was the King and God ruled over it. God knows what He is talking about, we have to realize that our thinking and our solutions really are not above the rules and punishments that God has put in place. As God has stated it how it should be.",

If the son was rebellious you could stone him. Any man that was hung on a tree was cursed of God. Christ hanged on a tree and become the curse for us so that we may not be cursed by God at all if we are in Christ. There was an crown of thorns on Jesus and it was from the curse. So Christ taking on the curse upon him almost literally. If you saw your brothers Ox go astray then you should bring it back to your brother or keep it in your house until he goes to seek for it. If you find something that is lost you should seek to restore it to the prior owners. An women is not to wear men\u2019s apparel or vice versa it is accounted as an abomination to God. If an women is raped in the field the man was put to death, but if in a place were people could hear both would be put to death because she did not scream.

Moses is about to give over leadership to Aaron.  God is now established an new covenant with man which is through Jesus Christ which enables us to experience all the blessings of God. The burnt offerings were the offerings of consecration, the peace offering was the offering of our communion with God. God says if they hearken diligently to observe and to do all that they were commanded then they would be fruitful in the land and would be set high among all the nations in the earth. They would be \u2018blessed\u2019 among people of the earth. In America today we are enjoying the benefits of an nation that was founded on the need and centrality of God in the national life.

The will return as the messiah to gather the people from the four corners of the earth. This is from Matthew 24:31, that is why many that focus their ministry in the new testament miss from the old testament the context they need to have for these prophecies. Salvation is as close to you as you could imagine. It is not something that we have to achieve by tremendous effort and energy. It is as close to us as confessing and believing, its an easy thing. Anyone can be saved in this very moment by just confessing and believing in Christ. Jesus I believe you rose from the dead. Believing is a matter of choice, you can choose to believe that Jesus rose from the dead.",

There is a repetition of the ten commandments in these chapters.  O that the people would hear me and obey me, God laments over us wanting to do so many things through us. He loves us so much and wants to demonstrate his love towards us. Our heart needs to be towards Him so that He can do many things through us! One compound unity, and absolute unity is the 2 words that are used in Hebrew for 1. The compound unity one is what God is being referred to saying \u201cGod is one Lord\u201d which is part of the SHMA, the heart of Judaism doctrine which refers to the trinity of God. God keeps an book of remembrance of everything that we speak to friends and people, we need to talk about God and Jesus more in our life\u2019s. Keeping the consciousness of God in our daily life. God is an jealous God so we should not tempt God but live towards Him. We should diligently keep the commandments of God and the statutes that it may be well of us.

God said to Moses that he would not be able to enter into the promised land. God says that Israel is to enter into this land and enter and take cities and peoples greater then them. But before they had the same word from God but they had fear 40 years earlier they had 40 years in the wilderness till the whole generation passed away. God was greater then the greatest obstacle they could face. It is foolish to look at things without for what they are but at the same time we need to look beyond the problems to the sustaining power of God. When we get too close to problems we can lose sight of God. Self righteousness so easily attaches to us, there is something so perverse about our nature is that we want to make people think we are more righteous then we are. We want people to think we are spiritual giants.",
