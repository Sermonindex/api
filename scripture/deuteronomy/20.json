Have you ever asked yourself, \"if God is with us why do I face such violent opposition?\" Are these obstacles and giants necessary? Obstacles and giants are placed on our path to teach us that we are not God. He is, and in and of yourself there is no strength to defeat these enemies. The Word of God promises that God Himseld will fight for us! Victory comes when we stand against these giants in the power of the Holy Spirit for the glory and honor of God's Name!",
