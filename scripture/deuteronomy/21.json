            "description": "The firstborn son always got the inheritance. You could never change the inheritance to any other children no matter how much you love them. If the son was rebellious you could stone him. Any man that was hung on a tree was cursed of God. Christ hanged on a tree and become the curse for us so that we may not be cursed by God at all if we are in Christ. There was an crown of thorns on Jesus and it was from the curse. So Christ taking on the curse upon him almost literally. If you saw your brothers Ox go astray then you should bring it back to your brother or keep it in your house until he goes to seek for it. If you find something that is lost you should seek to restore it to the prior owners. An women is not to wear men\u2019s apparel or vice versa it is accounted as an abomination to God. If an women is raped in the field the man was put to death, but if in a place were people could hear both would be put to death because she did not scream. This gives an picture of how morally astute people were in Israel in those days.",
