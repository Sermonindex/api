            "description": "Prophecy of Jesus that will be fulfilled in His glory, then the angels will go out and gather Gods people from the four corners of the earth. The will return as the messiah to gather the people from the four corners of the earth. This is from Matthew 24:31, that is why many that focus their ministry in the new testament miss from the old testament the context they need to have for these prophecies. Salvation is as close to you as you could imagine. It is not something that we have to achieve by tremendous effort and energy. It is as close to us as confessing and believing, its an easy thing. Anyone can be saved in this very moment by just confessing and believing in Christ. Jesus I believe you rose from the dead. Believing is a matter of choice, you can choose to believe that Jesus rose from the dead.",
