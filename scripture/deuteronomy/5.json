            "description": "The Lord talked to the people face to face. He is the God that brought the people out of the land of bondage. There is a repetition of the ten commandments in these chapters.  O that the people would hear me and obey me, God laments over us wanting to do so many things through us. He loves us so much and wants to demonstrate his love towards us. Our heart needs to be towards Him so that He can do many things through us! One compound unity, and absolute unity is the 2 words that are used in Hebrew for 1. The compound unity one is what God is being referred to saying \u201cGod is one Lord\u201d which is part of the SHMA, the heart of Judaism doctrine which refers to the trinity of God. God keeps an book of remembrance of everything that we speak to friends and people, we need to talk about God and Jesus more in our life\u2019s. Keeping the consciousness of God in our daily life. God is an jealous God so we should not tempt God but live towards Him. We should diligently keep the commandments of God and the statutes that it may be well of us. We have to take time to explain things to children because God has given children the power to question and ask questions about God.",
