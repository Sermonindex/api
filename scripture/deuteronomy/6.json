He shares on six holy qualities a father must have to effectively teach his children.  Kenaston strongly advocates making family devotions a top priority and shares from personal experience how the Lord has wrought godliness in his home through adopting that.",

Religious prisoners are often subjected to harsher treatment and given the most dangerous tasks, all to force them to renounce their faith. When they refuse, they have often been tortured to death. Likewise their children are sentenced to hard labor and starved to death.",

He also answered that you shall worship the Lord your God and Him alone you shall serve. And also that you shall not tempt the Lord your God (Matt 4). We must also find daily bread from Him; that we partake of Him that He brings that daily beauty and sweetness into our lives.",
