We don't know the journey God is taking us but he does. God will test and prove his people along this journey as he did Israel in the wilderness to see if we will believe and obey him. He wants us not living on bread (prosperity) promises alone, but by every promise in the Word of God. To not fully trust God is to strip him of all he wants to be and can be to us and bring him down to the level of a dead idol. It's a grievous sin in God's eyes to have unbelief, and the church needs to realize it.",
