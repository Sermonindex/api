            "description": "Deuteronomy is an rehearsal and an capsulation of the law that Moses had given before. Gods eyesight did not dwindle but at 120 years it was still perfect. God said to Moses that he would not be able to enter into the promised land. God says that Israel is to enter into this land and enter and take cities and peoples greater then them. But before they had the same word from God but they had fear 40 years earlier they had 40 years in the wilderness till the whole generation passed away. God was greater then the greatest obstacle they could face. It is foolish to look at things without for what they are but at the same time we need to look beyond the problems to the sustaining power of God. When we get too close to problems we can lose sight of God. Self righteousness so easily attaches to us, there is something so perverse about our nature is that we want to make people think we are more righteous then we are. We want people to think we are spiritual giants.",

Pastor Chuck was used in the Jesus People revival where he was used along with others to minister to the hippy young people. They saw a work of the Spirit where many were added to the church and discipled. He has raised up many pastors who are a part of the Calvary Chapel movement now and where he pastors the large Costa Mesa church in California.\r\n\r\nThe Calvary Chapel movement is based of simple principles that Chuck Smith taught over the years such as: The priority of agape love, Simple fellowship amongst the saints, the breaking of bread, the teaching of God's word chapter by chapter and verse by verse. And lastly and most importantly the principle not by might nor by power but by my spirit saith the Lord.",
