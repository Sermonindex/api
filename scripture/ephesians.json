Over the past 50 years particularly originating in Western countries there have been such excesses and abuses of what is considered Spirit-filled Christianity that many true believers have been repulsed completely from even seeking the Lord for the true filling of the Spirit. This is not only a tragedy but one of Satan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tactics323 to hinder the growth of the true Church of Jesus Christ. The genuine believer should never feel scared to call out to God for fresh infusions of the Spirit of God for service324 and to foster a dependence on the Holy Spirit of God daily in his life.",

It might not trouble you now, but one day it will be revealed and it will be terrible. \r\nBut to those who love God, He blesses to the thousand's generation. A certain newly-born baby simply did not stop crying and the doctor could not find the problem. Eventually he called for a specialist, but still they failed to diagnose the problem. Eventually one of the doctors had an idea, and he took a cigarette and blew the smoke into the face of the child. Immediately the crying stopped.

When we try to struggle our way out of a situation we are being God in that area. When we try to defeat sin in our own strength we are being God in that area. God the Father and Jesus Christ made a covenant with each other to put an end to sin and the power it has over us. It is only when we bend our knee to God and put our faith in the finished work of the Cross the struggle stops and God can be God to us.

The power of the Lord Jesus is great. However, the devil and demons have power too but limited. But God's power is the greatest, and He has commanded us to go into all the world and make disciples of all nations and teach them to keep all that He has commanded us (Matt 28:19-20). You do not get salvation through education. Education without Christ just produces clever devils. Jesus commanded us to teach the nations, not just to know, but to keep all that He has taught us.",

The death and ressurection of the Lord Jesus, the centre point of christianity, were factual events and these are the basis for our faith.  An ancient secular roman historian called Talus confirms the darkness that covered the earth following the death of the Lord Jesus, because he was alive at the time.  F.F. Bruce said that 'Anyone who propagates the idea that Jesus was a myth is neither a historian nor unbiased.' The distice features of the apostolic church were 1: the prescence of the foundational apostles 2:The unprecidented problems and victories of the church 3:The speed with which the Gospel spread 4:The transition of christianity from a branch of judaism to a seperate religion.",

The delay in Christ\u2019s return has to do with the fact that the \u201carmy of judges\u201d is not ready yet, he says. This life of trials and tests is to form Christ in us \u2013 which makes us ready to judge and rule with Him. He segues into the purpose of the blood of Christ: it forgives our sins, it cleanses sin, it covers us (for protection), it nourishes the inner man, it deadens the power of sin over you, and it will literally remove the sin from you (at His coming).

During these years, he was also closely related to Jessie Penn-Lewis and her publication and speaking ministry, the \"Overcomer Testimony.\"\r\n\r\nAmong the many books that he wrote, at least three are regarded as Christian classics: The School of Christ, The Centrality and Supremacy of the Lord Jesus Christ and We Beheld His Glory. The primary theme of Sparks' books is the exaltation of the Lord Jesus Christ. He mentored Watchman Nee for many years and was very influential in his understanding of the Church Life.",

SPURGEON, AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON. \u201cJesus Christ himself.\u201d-Ephesians 2:20. \u201cJesus Christ himself\u201d is to occupy all our thoughts this morning. What an ocean opens up before me! Here is sea-room for the largest barque! In which direction shall I turn your thoughts? I am embarrassed with riches. I know not where to begin: and when I once begin where shall I end? Assuredly we need not go abroad for joys this morning, for we have a feast at home. The words are few, but the meaning vast- \u201cJesus Christ himself.\u201d Beloved, the religion of our Lord Jesus Christ contains in it nothing so wonderful as himself. It is a mass of marvels, but he is THE miracle of it; the wonder of wonders is \u201cThe Wonderful\u201d himself. If proof be asked of the truth which he proclaimed, we point men to Jesus Christ himself. His character is unique. We defy unbelievers to imagine another like him. He is God and yet man, and we challenge them to compose a narrative in which the two apparently incongruous characters shall be so harmoniously blended, - in which the human and divine shall he so marvelously apparent, without the one overshadowing the other. They question the authenticity of the four Gospels; will they try and write a fifth? Will they even attempt to add a few incidents to the life which shall be worthy of the sacred biography, and congruous with those facts which are already described?",

In contrast to Whitefield's Calvinism, Wesley embraced the Arminian doctrines that were dominant in the 18th-century Church of England. Methodism in both forms became a highly successful evangelical movement in Britain, which encouraged people to experience Jesus Christ personally.\r\n\r\nWesley helped to organise and form societies of Christians throughout Great Britain, North America and Ireland as small groups that developed intensive, personal accountability, discipleship and religious instruction among members. His great contribution was to appoint itinerant, unordained preachers who travelled widely to evangelise and care for people in the societies. Under Wesley's direction, Methodists became leaders in many social issues of the day, including the prison reform and abolitionism movements.",

Many other things we might give thee warning of (gentle Reader) if we had not exceeded the measure of a Preface already. It remaineth, that we commend thee to God, and to the Spirit of his grace, which is able to build further than we can ask or think. He removeth the scales from our eyes, the vail from our hearts, opening our wits that we may understand his word, enlarging our hearts, yea correcting our affections, that we may love it to the end. Ye are brought unto fountains of living water which ye digged not; do not cast earth into them with the Philistines, neither prefer broken pits before them with the wicked Jews. [Gen 26:15. Jer 2:13.] Others have laboured, and you may enter into their labours; O receive not so great things in vain, O despise not so great salvation! Be not like swine to tread under foot so precious things, neither yet like dogs to tear and abuse holy things. Say not to our Saviour with the Gergesites, Depart out of our coast [Matt 8:34]; neither yet with Esau sell your birthright for a mess of pottage [Heb 12:16]. If light be come into the world, love not darkness more than light; if food, if clothing be offered, go not naked, starve not yourselves. Remember the advice of Nazianzene, \"It is a grievous thing\" (or dangerous) \"to neglect a great fair, and to seek to make markets afterwards:\" also the encouragement of S. Chrysostom, \"It is altogether impossible, that he that is sober\" (and watchful) \"should at any time be neglected:\" [S. Chrysost. in epist. ad Rom. cap. 14. oral. 26.]\r\nLastly, the admonition and menacing of S. Augustine, \"They that despise God's will inviting them, shall feel God's will taking vengeance of them.\" [S. August. ad artic. sibi falso object. Artic. 16.] It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God; [Heb 10:31] but a blessed thing it is, and will bring us to everlasting blessedness in the end, when God speaketh unto us, to hearken; when he setteth his word before us, to read it; when he stretcheth out his hand and calleth, to answer, Here am I, here we are to do thy will, O God. The Lord work a care and conscience in us to know him and serve him, that we may be acknowledged of him at the appearing of our Lord Jesus Christ, to whom with the holy Ghost, be all praise and thanksgiving.

The cross liberates us, the blood cleanses us from sin, and frees us from the law. The liberty of the New Covenant is freedom from sin, and bondage of striving in our flesh to be holy. Jesus refers to children in Matt 18, and warns against offending new Christians. We must allow the Holy Spirit to teach them, as we love them and pray for them. This is one of the best messages I've heard on the new covenant and the righteousness of Christ imputed to believers.",

Many of these have been translated into a number of languages and have been circulated widely around the world. He clearly and passionately shares the  narrow way of Christian discipleship that is neglected by so many modern preachers.",

Was a Christian missionary, teacher, writer, and advocate of economic development in impoverished nations. A spiritual crisis during this period\u2014as he described two decades later in what is probably his best-known recorded teaching, \"Ten Shekels and a Shirt\"--left Reidhead with the conviction that much of evangelicalism had adopted utilitarian and humanistic philosophies contradictory to Biblical teaching. The end of all being, he came to believe, was not the happiness of man, but the glorification of God. This theme would recur throughout his later teaching.\r\n\r\nSince Mr. Reidhead's death in 1992, Bible Teaching Ministries, Inc. continues under the leadership of his wife, Marjorie, and daughter, Virginia Teitt, a dedicated Board, and the many people who have donated time and talent after being changed by God\u2019s Word through this message.
