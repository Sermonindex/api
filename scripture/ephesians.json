This is not only a tragedy but one of Satan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tactics323 to hinder the growth of the true Church of Jesus Christ. The genuine believer should never feel scared to call out to God for fresh infusions of the Spirit of God for service324 and to foster a dependence on the Holy Spirit of God daily in his life.",

We must recognize God\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sovereignty and rule over all creation, our lives and the Church. We must submit our minds to the authority of Scripture as we submit to God in our spirits; He owns us now.",

Yet in the early Church and Biblical record, God calls the people themselves the Church.629\r\nOne of the main desires in church planting in North America is the constructing of a church building after a group of believers is established. This is not always helpful. The true work of God is not dependent on money and resources to grow but rather on hearts that have been affected by the Gospel of our Lord. If we focus on building structures and churches, we can subtly deceive the people to depend on such structures630 and not the living Lord.",

It might not trouble you now, but one day it will be revealed and it will be terrible. \r\nBut to those who love God, He blesses to the thousand's generation. A certain newly-born baby simply did not stop crying and the doctor could not find the problem. Eventually he called for a specialist, but still they failed to diagnose the problem. Eventually one of the doctors had an idea, and he took a cigarette and blew the smoke into the face of the child. Immediately the crying stopped. His mother smoked and the child suffered from nicotine-withdrawal symptoms.",

We all have a sin nature in us that desires to make choices apart from the will of God. God gave us the law as a school master to prove to us that we can't keep it. When we try to struggle our way out of a situation we are being God in that area. When we try to defeat sin in our own strength we are being God in that area. God the Father and Jesus Christ made a covenant with each other to put an end to sin and the power it has over us. It is only when we bend our knee to God and put our faith in the finished work of the Cross the struggle stops and God can be God to us. WE don't make promises to God, He makes them to us and He keeps them. It is not about works, it is all about faith in what Christ has already done.",

There are many tensions that need to be maintained between seeming opposites in the journey to being more Christ-like.",

But we do not fight against flesh and blood but rather against principalities and rulers of the darkness of this age. The Word tells us, finally, be strong in the Lord and in the power of His might. The power of the Lord Jesus is great. However, the devil and demons have power too but limited. But God's power is the greatest, and He has commanded us to go into all the world and make disciples of all nations and teach them to keep all that He has commanded us (Matt 28:19-20). You do not get salvation through education. Education without Christ just produces clever devils. Jesus commanded us to teach the nations, not just to know, but to keep all that He has taught us.",

He discusses in depth John 14:3. The \u201chouse\u201d referred to in the phrase \u201cIn My Father\u2019s House\u2026\u201d is not Heaven, but Jesus Himself \u2013 Jesus is the house of God. Not that Heaven does not exist, but it is not the goal. Jesus is the Father\u2019s house, and He makes a place in Himself for us, so that we become a room in that house.

The death and ressurection of the Lord Jesus, the centre point of christianity, were factual events and these are the basis for our faith.  An ancient secular roman historian called Talus confirms the darkness that covered the earth following the death of the Lord Jesus, because he was alive at the time.  F.F. Bruce said that 'Anyone who propagates the idea that Jesus was a myth is neither a historian nor unbiased.' The distice features of the apostolic church were 1: the prescence of the foundational apostles 2:The unprecidented problems and victories of the church 3:The speed with which the Gospel spread 4:The transition of christianity from a branch of judaism to a seperate religion.",

The delay in Christ\u2019s return has to do with the fact that the \u201carmy of judges\u201d is not ready yet, he says. This life of trials and tests is to form Christ in us \u2013 which makes us ready to judge and rule with Him. He segues into the purpose of the blood of Christ: it forgives our sins, it cleanses sin, it covers us (for protection), it nourishes the inner man, it deadens the power of sin over you, and it will literally remove the sin from you (at His coming). The sermon is much more interesting than I\u2019m making it sound.",

This sermon shows how, if you use worldly methods to attract people to your fellowships, worldly people are all you will attract.  Brother Zac uses a flurry of scriptures to blow away any notion that it is acceptable to God to still be of this present evil world.",

During this storm our friends and family who have in past times rejected us will come to us for help in their time of need. God will allow us to begin to guide them with Godly direction and provision. When we are gripped by God for the souls of men He will gives us strength and wisdom to be broken bread for them. The only way we can make it on this journey is to understand that the suffering we go through is worth it for those who don't know Jesus yet.",

SPURGEON, AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON. \u201cJesus Christ himself.\u201d-Ephesians 2:20. \u201cJesus Christ himself\u201d is to occupy all our thoughts this morning. What an ocean opens up before me! Here is sea-room for the largest barque! In which direction shall I turn your thoughts? I am embarrassed with riches. I know not where to begin: and when I once begin where shall I end? Assuredly we need not go abroad for joys this morning, for we have a feast at home. The words are few, but the meaning vast- \u201cJesus Christ himself.\u201d Beloved, the religion of our Lord Jesus Christ contains in it nothing so wonderful as himself. It is a mass of marvels, but he is THE miracle of it; the wonder of wonders is \u201cThe Wonderful\u201d himself. If proof be asked of the truth which he proclaimed, we point men to Jesus Christ himself. His character is unique. We defy unbelievers to imagine another like him. He is God and yet man, and we challenge them to compose a narrative in which the two apparently incongruous characters shall be so harmoniously blended, - in which the human and divine shall he so marvelously apparent, without the one overshadowing the other. They question the authenticity of the four Gospels; will they try and write a fifth? Will they even attempt to add a few incidents to the life which shall be worthy of the sacred biography, and congruous with those facts which are already described?",

            "description": "This message was preached on March 14, 2010 at All Saints Church in Logan, Utah. Part of a series on Ephesians entitled Grace in the Heavenlies, this message explores the glory of the grace of God in the redemption we have through the blood of Jesus Christ. Christianity does not end with forgiveness, it begins with it, and God is forming a people for Himself who have known His forgiveness and therefore know Him as He really is: the God of unsearchable grace. \"...That we should be to the praise of his glory, who first trusted in Christ.\" (Ephesians 1:12)",

Fathers must invest in their children, he exhorts;  \u201cDon\u2019t give them things, give them you\u201d. (49 minutes)",

When Jesus rose from the dead His resurrection life became available to all who would want it. If we are going to be blessed of God there is a journey involved. This journey will lead us to a place called Bethel where we are separated for the purposes of God. We will also be led to Jericho where we learn to trust God to break down every stronghold the the enemy has erected. As we walk with the Lord being one at heart with Him, He will anoint us and give us power to bring life into barren places.",

Jesus refers to children in Matt 18, and warns against offending new Christians. We must allow the Holy Spirit to teach them, as we love them and pray for them.
