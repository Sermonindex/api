God is holy and our walk as Christians need to be holy to as Tozer mentions.",

Yet in the early Church and Biblical record, God calls the people themselves the Church.629\r\nOne of the main desires in church planting in North America is the constructing of a church building after a group of believers is established. This is not always helpful. The true work of God is not dependent on money and resources to grow but rather on hearts that have been affected by the Gospel of our Lord. If we focus on building structures and churches, we can subtly deceive the people to depend on such structures630 and not the living Lord.",

We all have a sin nature in us that desires to make choices apart from the will of God. God gave us the law as a school master to prove to us that we can't keep it. When we try to struggle our way out of a situation we are being God in that area. When we try to defeat sin in our own strength we are being God in that area. God the Father and Jesus Christ made a covenant with each other to put an end to sin and the power it has over us. It is only when we bend our knee to God and put our faith in the finished work of the Cross the struggle stops and God can be God to us. WE don't make promises to God, He makes them to us and He keeps them. It is not about works, it is all about faith in what Christ has already done.",

He discusses in depth John 14:3. The \u201chouse\u201d referred to in the phrase \u201cIn My Father\u2019s House\u2026\u201d is not Heaven, but Jesus Himself \u2013 Jesus is the house of God. Not that Heaven does not exist, but it is not the goal. Jesus is the Father\u2019s house, and He makes a place in Himself for us, so that we become a room in that house. This sermon is practical, and it will stretch your brain a bit. (49 minutes 36 seconds)",

The death and ressurection of the Lord Jesus, the centre point of christianity, were factual events and these are the basis for our faith.  An ancient secular roman historian called Talus confirms the darkness that covered the earth following the death of the Lord Jesus, because he was alive at the time.  F.F. Bruce said that 'Anyone who propagates the idea that Jesus was a myth is neither a historian nor unbiased.' The distice features of the apostolic church were 1: the prescence of the foundational apostles 2:The unprecidented problems and victories of the church 3:The speed with which the Gospel spread 4:The transition of christianity from a branch of judaism to a seperate religion.",

SPURGEON, AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON. \u201cJesus Christ himself.\u201d-Ephesians 2:20. \u201cJesus Christ himself\u201d is to occupy all our thoughts this morning. What an ocean opens up before me! Here is sea-room for the largest barque! In which direction shall I turn your thoughts? I am embarrassed with riches. I know not where to begin: and when I once begin where shall I end? Assuredly we need not go abroad for joys this morning, for we have a feast at home. The words are few, but the meaning vast- \u201cJesus Christ himself.\u201d Beloved, the religion of our Lord Jesus Christ contains in it nothing so wonderful as himself. It is a mass of marvels, but he is THE miracle of it; the wonder of wonders is \u201cThe Wonderful\u201d himself. If proof be asked of the truth which he proclaimed, we point men to Jesus Christ himself. His character is unique. We defy unbelievers to imagine another like him. He is God and yet man, and we challenge them to compose a narrative in which the two apparently incongruous characters shall be so harmoniously blended, - in which the human and divine shall he so marvelously apparent, without the one overshadowing the other. They question the authenticity of the four Gospels; will they try and write a fifth? Will they even attempt to add a few incidents to the life which shall be worthy of the sacred biography, and congruous with those facts which are already described?",
