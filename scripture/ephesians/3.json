Even your selfishness and greed you pass on to your children and they suffer because of you. Turn therefore completely in all sincerity from all sin. It might not trouble you now, but one day it will be revealed and it will be terrible. \r\nBut to those who love God, He blesses to the thousand's generation. A certain newly-born baby simply did not stop crying and the doctor could not find the problem. Eventually he called for a specialist, but still they failed to diagnose the problem. Eventually one of the doctors had an idea, and he took a cigarette and blew the smoke into the face of the child. Immediately the crying stopped. His mother smoked and the child suffered from nicotine-withdrawal symptoms.",

We are to come boldly with a fixed position, believing the truth and power of His Word. We do not try to persuade God, but rather are fully persuaded with a fixed position to the faithfulness of His Word.",

Before one becomes a partaker of the divine nature, Major Thomas expounds what man in fact is.  We discover he is a living soul wrapped in flesh, needing the Spirit of God to breathe life into his Spirit.  Once the man is forgiven his goal must become, through grace, to allow and yield the Spirit\u2019s infiltration into jis soul and flesh that he may become an instrument of righteousness.",

When Jesus rose from the dead His resurrection life became available to all who would want it. If we are going to be blessed of God there is a journey involved. This journey will lead us to a place called Bethel where we are separated for the purposes of God. We will also be led to Jericho where we learn to trust God to break down every stronghold the the enemy has erected. As we walk with the Lord being one at heart with Him, He will anoint us and give us power to bring life into barren places.",
