He sought for God's honor with the zeal of Elijah and mourned with Jeremiah at the apostasy of God's people. \r\n\r\nLeonard Ravenhill was a close friend of pastor and writer A. W. Tozer and spoke of him as one of the most influential voices in the Church in America. A.W. Tozer's materials are a mainstay in Evangelical churches in our day and he is one of the most quoted authors. He was a prophet in his day and his writings are even more influential in our day.

The power of the Lord Jesus is great. However, the devil and demons have power too but limited. But God's power is the greatest, and He has commanded us to go into all the world and make disciples of all nations and teach them to keep all that He has commanded us (Matt 28:19-20). You do not get salvation through education. Education without Christ just produces clever devils. Jesus commanded us to teach the nations, not just to know, but to keep all that He has taught us.",

The delay in Christ\u2019s return has to do with the fact that the \u201carmy of judges\u201d is not ready yet, he says. This life of trials and tests is to form Christ in us \u2013 which makes us ready to judge and rule with Him. He segues into the purpose of the blood of Christ: it forgives our sins, it cleanses sin, it covers us (for protection), it nourishes the inner man, it deadens the power of sin over you, and it will literally remove the sin from you (at His coming). The sermon is much more interesting than I\u2019m making it sound.",
