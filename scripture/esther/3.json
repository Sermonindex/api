            "description": "Haman is 'the bad guy' of the story of Esther, interestingly he was the descendent of Agag king of the Amalekites, a man whom king Saul (of whom Mordecai was a descendent) spared against the will of God, it is interesting that if Saul had obeyed the Lord in wipoing out the Amalekites the events of Esther might never have taken place, there is an important lesson here in that our disobedience toward God may have far reaching consequences beyond our own lives.  Haman was promted to be the 'prime minister' of the Persian empire and this everyone had to pay ho9mage to him, which they did, all except Mordecai and Haman was greatly angered by this and sought revenge, not just against Mordecai but against his people, the Jews.  Haman went to the king and lies and asks that all the jews be killed in a holocaust fashion, the king doesn't check the facts but agrees and a decree is sent through all the empire.  Mordecai is greatly troubled by this and mourns and tells his niece Esther, the queen, that she has come to her place of status for sucha time as this.",

            "description": "(Preached: Feb. 8th, 2004). In a place of complacency, the enemy rose up to try to destroy God's people. After the captivity in Babylon, many of Israel had grown comfortable and stayed, rather than returning. Mixture in the world gives the enemy room to rise up and rule over you. Esther fasted and prayed, but she then had to get up and go to the king. We, as the Body of Christ, need to remember we are ambassadors of Christ, and there is no time for games. Jesus is coming, and we need to come out from among the world, and seperate ourselves for his purposes. If you are struggling with your flesh, this message will help you, and hopefully motivate you. Esther risked her life to intercede for her people. We need to risk whatever will come into our lives whether persecution, or trouble, to be seperated to God's purposes.",
