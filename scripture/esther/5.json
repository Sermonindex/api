            "description": "After 3 days of fasting a prayer Esther puts her life on the line and goes and sees the king without his permission, which was a capital offence.  The king shows her mercy and asks what her request is, she asks that she would prepare 2 banquets for the king and Haman.  This was a great honour for Haman, who is overjoyed by it, so they have their banquet and the king asks again what Esthers request is, but again she bides her time.  Haman on his way home sees Mordecai still mouring and is greatly angered that he still does not honour him.  That night the king is unable to sleep and asks for the chronicles to be read to him, in this he discovers that Mordecai has saved his life and not been rewarded yet.  So the king asks Haman what should be done to the man whom the king wishes to honour, Haman thi nking the king means him advises him how and the king commands that Haman honour Mordecai!!  If this wasn't enough for Haman the day after Esther exposes his plot to the king to kill her and all the jews the king flies of into a rage and demands Haman be killed on the very instrument of execution that he had prepared for Mordecai. A problem still remained however the empire had declared that all jews should be killed on a certain day and that day was looming.",
