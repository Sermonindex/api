Egyptians became worried that they would grow to big and even overtake the Egyptians. So Egyptians inflicted heavy slave labor on the children of Israel and set taskmasters over them. But they still continued to grow. Nations seem to grow well under persecution and adversity. It is same with the church that when it was under persecution it was strong but when prosperity came and it was an state accepted religion it became weak. Prosperity makes the church weak, but trials and tribulations make it strong. It was said that as soon as Jewish babies were born the mothers would whisper in their years: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Jehovah is God\u00e2\u20ac\u009d. What a responsibility for godly women to raise children with scripture so that they will not go away from Gods ways.

            "description": "The Lord gave the Israelites favor in the site of the Egyptian people. Even the servants pleaded with Pharaoh to let Moses and the people go. People started to respect Moses and knew that his God was real. At Midnight the plague of the firstborn happened. It was from the least to the greatest and even the cattle. Life really begins with Jesus Christ. God says start counting here this is where things are really going to begin to start. The blood of the lamb in Egypt on the doorposts is a type of Christ. It is not be trodden underfoot thus the blood was to be on the side posts and the upper part of the door but not on the threshold (bottom part). The Passover was to be eaten in hast and was to eat and eat till you could not eat anymore. They needed all the strength and energy that they could store up. They had to eat it also as they were prepared to go. They ate on the ground with pillows in more of a relaxed setting rather then western formal ways to eat.",

Many times we think it is a lucky thing to be a leader and lead people. But really leadership takes a lot of hard critism and a hard time from the people, leaders cant please everyone at once. There are times to pray and there are times to move and do things. We have to hear from God and be sensitive to His voice to know when this time is. How big of a God do we serve? God is able to split waters in the largest deepest places! What a marvelous miracle. It is a miracle either way! If it was a very shallow lake then it was amazing how God could drown the whole Egyptian army in a few feet of water, or if it was a deep lake then he split those massive walls of water. God always leads us into a desolate place so that he can prove that he is leading us and guiding us.",

When people are hungry they become irritable and moody. They so quickly forget the misery and the cruel bondage of Egypt. It is like a person coming out of the world and now when we look back at the world it looks more glamorous. We forget the bondage and evil of it us being brought to Christ from the darkness into the light. God says to Moses that he will give them bread from heaven, and stipulates rules for its distribution, keeping and eating. The bread is given to show the people there is a Lord God! The bread is a type of Christ and our need to be sustained by Him daily. God is the one that has brought me into these circumstances; our complaints are really against the Lord many times. In the cloud the glory of the Lord appeared! It was an awesome kind of display and demonstration of His glory. It is not said exactly how it looked or what it was but it was something glorious.

The Lord commanded him to say these things to the people. And the peoples response was it is a good thing and we wil do all the Lord said, but this is a rash comment without meditation and consideration on behalf of the people. God wanted the people to fast and be before the Lord at the mountain abit away from it. The mountain filled with smoke and it was shaking, and when the voice of the trumpet got louder and louder then God spake to him by a voice.

God gives guidelines for those who would be judges. The word for judges are elohim, for they are acting in the place of God, bringing Gods judgment on man and therefore acting in the place of God. When Jesus declared before Abraham was I am, then they are about to stone him, then he said did not the scriptures say you are God\u2019s? It does not mean they are actually God\u2019s but rather placed in a place of authority because God has called them to it. Elohim is not used exclusively for the God that created the heavens and the earth. Elohim really terms to the master passion and captivation of their life. The Mormons have built a whole doctrine of mans progression to God off these words of Jesus which obviously twist scriptures. In the end you will be able to go to a planet and start your own planet and others who didn\u2019t make it to that high calling will be angels and other servants for the planet. Bringham Young brought this back one step and said Adam was a good Mormon, and became a God and that Adam is our God and the only God with what he has to do. This whole system is taken from one little verse has been made and came out of that one verse of scripture.",

These curtains are to be a picture of heaven, and there were golden rings put into the curtain so it could be hanged through a large pole over the top of the tabernacle. The tabernacle is a portable building and is to be moved when they moved. All the parts inside of the tabernacle where made to be moved. It was called the place of meeting, the place where the people are to meet God. Somewhere along the line we have gotten the wrong concept, the church is not Gods house.

Because the people are so rebellious and prone to sin so God rather showed grace to the people. The people began to mourn before God. God said you are a stiff-necked people and he told them to strip their ornaments from them. Jesus died outside of Jerusalem and in the same way to meet with God the Jew has to come out of Judaism and come out to meet God. AS the people saw God descended on the tent door with Moses inside ministering to the Lord, they worshipped God. God said to Moses you cannot see my face but there was such a complete and total communication between God and Moses. In the New Testament Jesus said no man has seen God at anytime. So comparing Scripture with Scripture Moses never really did see the actual face of God. Every time a man has a revelation of God its brilliance is like the sun and the brightness of his glory so no form. We should covet this face-to-face relationship that Moses has with the Lord.",

It is a gift for us to observe it, it is not just a spiritual commandment but it will help us physically. We should give to God out of a willing heart not of a reluctant heart. God does not want anything from you from money, time, and service. We force many people to serve in the church but it is better for God to just lead people into service in different parts of the church. In some churches they put pressure to give you more then you want to. We need to be willing to serve or give our money for it to be a gift. We cannot complain to God from our giving it must be done cheerfully. Never out of constraint or pressure, Calvary Chapel never pressures people to do it. This is the kind of giving and service God will honor. As many was were willing hearted came brought there gold and ornaments to God in exodus and this \u201cwilling\u201d is the secret of giving.

When we go out to do the will of God we think God did you really call me to do this? Because sometimes things appear to be a mess but its Gods way of bring about the blessing.  Satan is going to do the best to discourage you at the beginning of any ministry. Satan loves to challenge any gift of the Spirit, if you by faith step out to speak the word of God people will challenge it and you will question is it really God that was speaking to me. God is the Lord, many times we take that position away from Him, Because we are so prone to exalt ourselves. When they knew God they glorified Him not as God, they began to live as God is their servant not they his servants. It is glorious to have a close intimate relationship with God, to know Him as Jehovah.",

If it was important to have specific church buildings to represent God and spread the Gospel, would God not have commanded them in Scripture?

As the prophet says: \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcHeaven is My throne, and the earth is My footstool. What kind of house will you build for Me? Says the Lord. Or where will My resting place be?

How it was only possible, and still is, only possible to be truelly free bondage by no other way than by the blood of the Lord Jesus Christ.",

A spiritual crisis during this period\u2014as he described two decades later in what is probably his best-known recorded teaching, \"Ten Shekels and a Shirt\"--left Reidhead with the conviction that much of evangelicalism had adopted utilitarian and humanistic philosophies contradictory to Biblical teaching. The end of all being, he came to believe, was not the happiness of man, but the glorification of God. This theme would recur throughout his later teaching.\r\n\r\nSince Mr. Reidhead's death in 1992, Bible Teaching Ministries, Inc. continues under the leadership of his wife, Marjorie, and daughter, Virginia Teitt, a dedicated Board, and the many people who have donated time and talent after being changed by God\u2019s Word through this message.

I came to Christ at a Billy Graham Los Angeles Crusade in the 1960's. While completing my Bachelor of Science degree in Business Administration at Cal Poly Pomona, I sensed the call of God on my life to follow Jesus Christ completely and possibly forget business and prepare for the ministry.. Soon after that I met Alan Redpath who invited me and my wife Jean to England, where we attended Capernwray Bible School. Upon returning to the United States, I continued my studies at Talbot Seminary in La Mirada, California.\r\nEarly in my ministry, I served for four years as an assistant pastor to Chuck Smith at Calvary Chapel of Costa Mesa, California. Next Jean and I moved to Lake Arrowhead where we planted and pastored Calvary Chapel of Lake Arrowhead. During those years I founded Calvary Chapel Bible College in nearby Twin Peaks at the Calvary Chapel Conference Center (The college is now located in Murrieta Hot Springs). Sensing the Lord's direction to move on, we then pioneered and pastored another Calvary Chapel in Redlands, California, for eleven years. In 1991, we again, still having that pioneering heart, moved to San Jose with the heart to plant a number of churches in the Bay Area. There are now eight fellowships that have grown out of Calvary Chapel of San Jose. In September 2002, we responded to a request from Chuck Smith to return to Calvary Chapel of Costa Mesa to serve as an assistant. And, in 2004 we took to the leadership of Calvary Chapel of Laguna Beach to help guide it through a difficult time. That work being completed, we have now responded to a long time desire to step out and serve the churches and schools and missionaries that we love so much around the world. Which brings us now to Calvary Way Ministries.",

While completing my Bachelor of Science degree in Business Administration at Cal Poly Pomona, I sensed the call of God on my life to follow Jesus Christ completely and possibly forget business and prepare for the ministry.. Soon after that I met Alan Redpath who invited me and my wife Jean to England, where we attended Capernwray Bible School. Upon returning to the United States, I continued my studies at Talbot Seminary in La Mirada, California.\r\nEarly in my ministry, I served for four years as an assistant pastor to Chuck Smith at Calvary Chapel of Costa Mesa, California. Next Jean and I moved to Lake Arrowhead where we planted and pastored Calvary Chapel of Lake Arrowhead. During those years I founded Calvary Chapel Bible College in nearby Twin Peaks at the Calvary Chapel Conference Center (The college is now located in Murrieta Hot Springs). Sensing the Lord's direction to move on, we then pioneered and pastored another Calvary Chapel in Redlands, California, for eleven years. In 1991, we again, still having that pioneering heart, moved to San Jose with the heart to plant a number of churches in the Bay Area. There are now eight fellowships that have grown out of Calvary Chapel of San Jose. In September 2002, we responded to a request from Chuck Smith to return to Calvary Chapel of Costa Mesa to serve as an assistant. And, in 2004 we took to the leadership of Calvary Chapel of Laguna Beach to help guide it through a difficult time. That work being completed, we have now responded to a long time desire to step out and serve the churches and schools and missionaries that we love so much around the world. Which brings us now to Calvary Way Ministries.",

A stubborn person can appear humble, zealous and even excercise spiritual gifts, but there comes a certain point they can't get passed. They can't lay down their inner thoughts of the way things should be done and surrender to God's ways. God will allow a sense of emptiness come into our souls to get our attention. He is looking for a sincere heart to submit to the authority of His Word. When we choose to obey Him the power of sin and decay is cancelled in our lives.

His eschatological insight is a very needful truth to be realized in the body of Christ. \r\n\r\nArt was a prophetic voice insofar as he called his listeners to purposes in God that would affect both time and eternity, purposes that had to do with the glory of God in the Church.   Frequently, his messages called the Church to an awareness of the Last Days [End-times] in such a way that made that time seem imminent and at the door.",

The Lord said to Moses 'I am that I am' meaning that there is no-one like Him, unlike us when He looks about He see's none like Him, except for a Carpenter who walked the earth 2000 Years ago.

This message is a rebuke to those who viciously thunder condemning messages to those struggling with sin. If listened to out of context, and with a wrong spirit, one might think Brother Wilkerson is saying that \"it doesn't matter if you sin.\"  He is not. Brother Wilkerson emphasizes the importance of delivering the FULL counsel of God - that although there is great \"severity\" if one does not surrender their life to Jesus, the Lord is also full of forgiveness and loving-kindness.  \"By lovingkindness and truth iniquity is atoned for, And by the fear of the LORD one keeps away from evil.\" Proverbs 16:6",

There is a false worship that sounds like the noise of war and there is a true worship that only comes from being true to God.  If we find that we are not walking in a true and honest worship, we must take a sword {the word of God} to that false worship and kill the false worship.   Exo 32:27  And he said unto them, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel, Put every man his sword by his side, and go in and out from gate to gate throughout the camp, and slay every man his brother, and every man his companion, and every man his neighbor.",
