            "description": "The Lord gave the Israelites favor in the site of the Egyptian people. Even the servants pleaded with Pharaoh to let Moses and the people go. People started to respect Moses and knew that his God was real. At Midnight the plague of the firstborn happened. It was from the least to the greatest and even the cattle. Life really begins with Jesus Christ. God says start counting here this is where things are really going to begin to start. The blood of the lamb in Egypt on the doorposts is a type of Christ. It is not be trodden underfoot thus the blood was to be on the side posts and the upper part of the door but not on the threshold (bottom part). The Passover was to be eaten in hast and was to eat and eat till you could not eat anymore. They needed all the strength and energy that they could store up. They had to eat it also as they were prepared to go. They ate on the ground with pillows in more of a relaxed setting rather then western formal ways to eat.",
