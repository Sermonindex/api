If we are called by God the powers of darkness know the potential we have in Christ. When we come to our red sea of impossibility God promises every enemy will be drowned behind us. There is a glory that will come upon a people who choose to get into the Word of God and simply declare the impossible possible. There will be a people in this last hour of time who have the testimony of Jesus Christ and a glory song that the world must reckon with. This day captivity will be broken and your song will be, \"only God can do this\"!! It is time to go forward into the miraculous!",

Wrong reasoning leads to wrong conclusions which lead us to wrong actions and we end up on a wrong pathway. We must refuse to be led by fear and begin to aloe faith to lead us. Faith in Jesus always parts the waters of impossibilities and causes us to stand still and see Yeshua our Way maker.",

Jacob had lived a tumultous life, with one trial after another, yet when he was old and dying, he leaned on his staff and worshipped, saying his bad times had been few, as he reflected on the faithfulness of God. God had brought him through so many things, and he will be faithful to us, too",

When God said \"Let my people go\" it had to happen for when he speaks it is done. God spoke this world into existence, and he wants to speak deliverance into your life!!!!",
