            "description": "The word holy at it's very core means 'cut' or seperate, God is so far beyond what we think He is like that we cannot truelly concieve of how what He truelly is.  In christianity today we have such a small God that bares little resemblence to the high and lofty One that inhabits eternity.  The Lord said to Moses 'I am that I am' meaning that there is no-one like Him, unlike us when He looks about He see's none like Him, except for a Carpenter who walked the earth 2000 Years ago.  The essence of seperation (holiness) is not what we are seperated from but what or in this case Who, we are seperated to.  There is no point seperating ourselves from the world if we don't then seperate ourselves unto God.",
