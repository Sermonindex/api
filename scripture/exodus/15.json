God supplied the water, but Moses named the place \"Marah\" meaning bitterness. There are those of God's people who have been hurt and have the root of bitterness in them and God wants to lovingly deal with and remove it lest they be defiled by it. The Lord who heals can mend your broken heart. Part 2 of 8",

In christianity today we have such a small God that bares little resemblence to the high and lofty One that inhabits eternity.  The Lord said to Moses 'I am that I am' meaning that there is no-one like Him, unlike us when He looks about He see's none like Him, except for a Carpenter who walked the earth 2000 Years ago.  The essence of seperation (holiness) is not what we are seperated from but what or in this case Who, we are seperated to.  There is no point seperating ourselves from the world if we don't then seperate ourselves unto God.",
