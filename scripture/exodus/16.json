            "description": "The whole congregation murmurs against Moses and the leadership. Because in the desert they are worried that they are going to all die of hunger. When people are hungry they become irritable and moody. They so quickly forget the misery and the cruel bondage of Egypt. It is like a person coming out of the world and now when we look back at the world it looks more glamorous. We forget the bondage and evil of it us being brought to Christ from the darkness into the light. God says to Moses that he will give them bread from heaven, and stipulates rules for its distribution, keeping and eating. The bread is given to show the people there is a Lord God! The bread is a type of Christ and our need to be sustained by Him daily. God is the one that has brought me into these circumstances; our complaints are really against the Lord many times. In the cloud the glory of the Lord appeared! It was an awesome kind of display and demonstration of His glory. It is not said exactly how it looked or what it was but it was something glorious. Manna = what is it.",

            "description": "May 27, 2007 - A stubborn person is a person who is fixed in purpose or condition, resistant to change and unreasonably obstinate. A stubborn person has an inner flaw and this inner flaw doesn't show until they are called to put all they are in the hands of God and walk in obedience. A stubborn person can appear humble, zealous and even excercise spiritual gifts, but there comes a certain point they can't get passed. They can't lay down their inner thoughts of the way things should be done and surrender to God's ways. God will allow a sense of emptiness come into our souls to get our attention. He is looking for a sincere heart to submit to the authority of His Word. When we choose to obey Him the power of sin and decay is cancelled in our lives. The only way out of stubbornness is to HUMBLE ourselves before God.",
