Starting with a personal testimony seeing first hand the warfare of the devil in a crowded farmhouse packed with sinners seeking salvation, he segues into the vital necessity of character before God--clean hands and a pure heart.  Campbell repeatedly warns against the overemphasis of man in modern evangelism, hymns and even one's own consecration, pleading for God to be all in all.",

This message is a rebuke to those who viciously thunder condemning messages to those struggling with sin. If listened to out of context, and with a wrong spirit, one might think Brother Wilkerson is saying that \"it doesn't matter if you sin.\"  He is not. Brother Wilkerson emphasizes the importance of delivering the FULL counsel of God - that although there is great \"severity\" if one does not surrender their life to Jesus, the Lord is also full of forgiveness and loving-kindness.  \"By lovingkindness and truth iniquity is atoned for, And by the fear of the LORD one keeps away from evil.\" Proverbs 16:6",
