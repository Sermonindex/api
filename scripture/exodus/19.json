They would be a kingdom of priests, a special people who will represent God before the world. So Israel was to be God\u2019s representatives to the world. A Holy Nation, a kingdom of Priests. The Lord commanded him to say these things to the people. And the peoples response was it is a good thing and we wil do all the Lord said, but this is a rash comment without meditation and consideration on behalf of the people. God wanted the people to fast and be before the Lord at the mountain abit away from it. The mountain filled with smoke and it was shaking, and when the voice of the trumpet got louder and louder then God spake to him by a voice. Some of the priest didn\u2019t sanctify himself but they are not excluded. Some of us think we are holy and beyond these normal things but we are not above these things.

A revivalist and man of God who sought God's will above all else. He was a man of prayer who practiced what he preached. He wrote the book: 'Why Revival Tarries' which has become a classic on revival. His prophetic edge and burden made him to be respected by some and disliked by others. Yet he stayed true to God's call on his life prayed and pleading for true heaven sent revival. \r\n\r\n\"Those who know of Leonard Ravenhill recognize in him the religious specialist, the man sent from God to battle the priests of Baal on their own mountain top, to shame the careless priest at the altar, to face the false prophet, and to warn the people who are being led astray by him. \" - Tozer | \"Leonard Ravenhill was one of the few men I have ever known who was a true prophet.\" - David Wilkerson",

You can hear the wailing and weeping of people as God's spirit begins to convict and deal with peoples hearts. God called Moses and the 70 elders to come up to the mountain into his presence to meet with him. \"They all saw the God of Israel;\" (24:10), and they ate in his presence, and did drink. (v. 11) But only Moses was allowed to meet with God, and called on up further. The others were told to wait. But they did not. This message deals with the issues of the heart that hinder or prevent us from going all the way and answering the wooing of the Holy Spirit to come out from among them and seek the face of God.  [i]NOTE: First 15 minutes of this message is worship in slovak. And the message is intrepreted to the people in slovak.[\/i]",
