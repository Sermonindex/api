I have delivered them from Egypt now therefore if you will obey my voice and keep my covenant you will be a special treasure to me said God. They would be a kingdom of priests, a special people who will represent God before the world. So Israel was to be God\u2019s representatives to the world. A Holy Nation, a kingdom of Priests. The Lord commanded him to say these things to the people. And the peoples response was it is a good thing and we wil do all the Lord said, but this is a rash comment without meditation and consideration on behalf of the people. God wanted the people to fast and be before the Lord at the mountain abit away from it. The mountain filled with smoke and it was shaking, and when the voice of the trumpet got louder and louder then God spake to him by a voice. Some of the priest didn\u2019t sanctify himself but they are not excluded. Some of us think we are holy and beyond these normal things but we are not above these things. We all need to humble ourselves and seek the Lord.",

God called Moses and the 70 elders to come up to the mountain into his presence to meet with him. \"They all saw the God of Israel;\" (24:10), and they ate in his presence, and did drink.
