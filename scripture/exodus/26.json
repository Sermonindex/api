            "description": "In the tabernacle the furnishings of the tabernacle is to discussed. And also for the other parts of the temple, the loaves, altar, tables, etc. Now the Tabernacle itself is to be contrasted and it is thought to be more of a tent rather then a stone building. There are 2 large curtains of linen made and there are many cerebrum that are weaven into this fabric. These curtains are to be a picture of heaven, and there were golden rings put into the curtain so it could be hanged through a large pole over the top of the tabernacle. The tabernacle is a portable building and is to be moved when they moved. All the parts inside of the tabernacle where made to be moved. It was called the place of meeting, the place where the people are to meet God. Somewhere along the line we have gotten the wrong concept, the church is not Gods house. It is a place of meeting but it is not were God is restricted to. We are the church and its not the building.",
