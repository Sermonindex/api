Stephen Kaung is a Chinese Chrisitan speaker and writer, and now living in Richmond, Virgina. At an early age was converted to Christianity and was active in the Methodist Church in China, with home his father was a minister.

I came to Christ at a Billy Graham Los Angeles Crusade in the 1960's. While completing my Bachelor of Science degree in Business Administration at Cal Poly Pomona, I sensed the call of God on my life to follow Jesus Christ completely and possibly forget business and prepare for the ministry.. Soon after that I met Alan Redpath who invited me and my wife Jean to England, where we attended Capernwray Bible School. Upon returning to the United States, I continued my studies at Talbot Seminary in La Mirada, California.\r\nEarly in my ministry, I served for four years as an assistant pastor to Chuck Smith at Calvary Chapel of Costa Mesa, California. Next Jean and I moved to Lake Arrowhead where we planted and pastored Calvary Chapel of Lake Arrowhead. During those years I founded Calvary Chapel Bible College in nearby Twin Peaks at the Calvary Chapel Conference Center (The college is now located in Murrieta Hot Springs). Sensing the Lord's direction to move on, we then pioneered and pastored another Calvary Chapel in Redlands, California, for eleven years. In 1991, we again, still having that pioneering heart, moved to San Jose with the heart to plant a number of churches in the Bay Area. There are now eight fellowships that have grown out of Calvary Chapel of San Jose. In September 2002, we responded to a request from Chuck Smith to return to Calvary Chapel of Costa Mesa to serve as an assistant. And, in 2004 we took to the leadership of Calvary Chapel of Laguna Beach to help guide it through a difficult time. That work being completed, we have now responded to a long time desire to step out and serve the churches and schools and missionaries that we love so much around the world. Which brings us now to Calvary Way Ministries.",
