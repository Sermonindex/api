Because the people are so rebellious and prone to sin so God rather showed grace to the people. The people began to mourn before God. God said you are a stiff-necked people and he told them to strip their ornaments from them. Jesus died outside of Jerusalem and in the same way to meet with God the Jew has to come out of Judaism and come out to meet God. AS the people saw God descended on the tent door with Moses inside ministering to the Lord, they worshipped God. God said to Moses you cannot see my face but there was such a complete and total communication between God and Moses. In the New Testament Jesus said no man has seen God at anytime. So comparing Scripture with Scripture Moses never really did see the actual face of God. Every time a man has a revelation of God its brilliance is like the sun and the brightness of his glory so no form. We should covet this face-to-face relationship that Moses has with the Lord.",

            "description": "God does not yell at us when we are struggling. It is His desire to see us \"strengthened in the inner man\" that we might walk \"in the Light\" as He is in the Light. This message is a rebuke to those who viciously thunder condemning messages to those struggling with sin. If listened to out of context, and with a wrong spirit, one might think Brother Wilkerson is saying that \"it doesn't matter if you sin.\"  He is not. Brother Wilkerson emphasizes the importance of delivering the FULL counsel of God - that although there is great \"severity\" if one does not surrender their life to Jesus, the Lord is also full of forgiveness and loving-kindness.  \"By lovingkindness and truth iniquity is atoned for, And by the fear of the LORD one keeps away from evil.\" Proverbs 16:6",
