When we go out to do the will of God we think God did you really call me to do this? Because sometimes things appear to be a mess but its Gods way of bring about the blessing.  Satan is going to do the best to discourage you at the beginning of any ministry. Satan loves to challenge any gift of the Spirit, if you by faith step out to speak the word of God people will challenge it and you will question is it really God that was speaking to me. God is the Lord, many times we take that position away from Him, Because we are so prone to exalt ourselves. When they knew God they glorified Him not as God, they began to live as God is their servant not they his servants. It is glorious to have a close intimate relationship with God, to know Him as Jehovah.",

And lastly and most importantly the principle not by might nor by power but by my spirit saith the Lord.",
