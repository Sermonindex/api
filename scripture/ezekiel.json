They were haughty and did detestable things before me. Therefore I did away with them as you have seen\" Ezekiel 16:49. Jackie gives a short, deep and challenging call to go and minister to the poor with a broken heart. Her message is followed by personal testimonies. The recording ends in weeping over the hardness of our hearts and for the poor. Real ministry is to show people the Lord of the Word: \"They will know what He is like by what you are like. So you live it with your life and they will read you like an epistle.\" Whenever the destitute cry out, God will respond by sending a person, and it could be you. God works through people. Jackie also points out that the poor don't need training in evangelism, as evangelism is simply \"one poor man telling another poor man where to find bread\".",

God chose the lowly things of this world and the despised things\u00e2\u20ac\u201dand the things that are not\u00e2\u20ac\u201dto nullify the things that are, so that no one may boast before Him.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d The question is, are we weak enough for God to call and use us? Are we empty of all the traditions of religious men so that we can learn from the Lord Himself? This is the way of the Lord. God is looking for a Gideon\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s army of those that are willing to trust fully in His power and not in any might or power of their own. God uses nobodies that will trust Him implicitly and fully. Are you going to be part of this Gideon\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s army today?",

The Pentagon - the symbol of invincible strength, burned by fire. There are pictures in society in the news papers of people given to self gratification, addicted to drugs, obsessed with wealth, publicity and fame only to be lead to an early grave. Could it be the Lord is putting before us a picture of what we are becoming as a society. Thanks be to God that there are other pictures that God desires to use to show to society. If you are in a dungeon of darkness and despair God is preparing you to be a picture to this society. Pictures are developed in a dark room.

He reluctantly took his glory from Israel as illustrated in Ezekiel, and nobody even noticed, for the priests were busy with their secret things. Whatever you give your time and attention to the most is what is influencing your character and is becoming your idol. Too many go to church, going through the motions on Sunday and the rest of the week devote themselves to their own pursuits and pleasures and wonder why they can't feel God's presence. God desires to dwell among his people. But when they don't like to retain the knowledge of God, when they prefer an appearance of godliness with no power it will lead to destruction.",

If you are sick of your sin, and weary of it, there is hope for God will never refuse a sincere heart.

The end result of standing before the wrong image of God will lead the people into a theological perspective that is based on human optimism as opposed to sacrifice and truth. The true image of God represents Jesus Christ, the Cross , His sacrifice and all that is Holy. If we are going to know the true image of God, we will be led to a place where we are undone, where everything that we thought we were has to die. We must take joyfully the spoils of all of our religious goods and come before this image of the TRUE and Holy God.

Pastor Chuck was used in the Jesus People revival where he was used along with others to minister to the hippy young people. They saw a work of the Spirit where many were added to the church and discipled. He has raised up many pastors who are a part of the Calvary Chapel movement now and where he pastors the large Costa Mesa church in California.\r\n\r\nThe Calvary Chapel movement is based of simple principles that Chuck Smith taught over the years such as: The priority of agape love, Simple fellowship amongst the saints, the breaking of bread, the teaching of God's word chapter by chapter and verse by verse. And lastly and most importantly the principle not by might nor by power but by my spirit saith the Lord.",
