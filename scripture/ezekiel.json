They were haughty and did detestable things before me. Therefore I did away with them as you have seen\" Ezekiel 16:49. Jackie gives a short, deep and challenging call to go and minister to the poor with a broken heart. Her message is followed by personal testimonies. The recording ends in weeping over the hardness of our hearts and for the poor. Real ministry is to show people the Lord of the Word: \"They will know what He is like by what you are like. So you live it with your life and they will read you like an epistle.\" Whenever the destitute cry out, God will respond by sending a person, and it could be you. God works through people. Jackie also points out that the poor don't need training in evangelism, as evangelism is simply \"one poor man telling another poor man where to find bread\".",

Once we have been prepared to dwell in that fire, and for that fire to dwell in us, we can then go out and minister to lost mankind, bringing that fire and that life to people \u2013 it will flow out of us and bring life and light. Dr. Thompson says that is our eternal purpose in Christ \u2013 to be priests of God in His Kingdom forever. He discusses the unique unity that Adam and Eve shared, and the similarities with the unity that Christ and the Church are to have.

Images of the towers in New York City - symbols of pride and commerce that America trusts in, and in one hour they came crashing down. The Pentagon - the symbol of invincible strength, burned by fire. There are pictures in society in the news papers of people given to self gratification, addicted to drugs, obsessed with wealth, publicity and fame only to be lead to an early grave. Could it be the Lord is putting before us a picture of what we are becoming as a society. Thanks be to God that there are other pictures that God desires to use to show to society. If you are in a dungeon of darkness and despair God is preparing you to be a picture to this society. Pictures are developed in a dark room. God is calling the Church of Jesus Christ to come out of these dark places of despair to be the last picture of His love, mercy and faithfulness.",

He reluctantly took his glory from Israel as illustrated in Ezekiel, and nobody even noticed, for the priests were busy with their secret things. Whatever you give your time and attention to the most is what is influencing your character and is becoming your idol. Too many go to church, going through the motions on Sunday and the rest of the week devote themselves to their own pursuits and pleasures and wonder why they can't feel God's presence. God desires to dwell among his people. But when they don't like to retain the knowledge of God, when they prefer an appearance of godliness with no power it will lead to destruction.",

There are those who respond with remorse and repentance to this and those we do not because they have made peace with it. If you are sick of your sin, and weary of it, there is hope for God will never refuse a sincere heart. But if you are cold, and have no urgency to pray or read the word of God, no concern for the lost and are taking your sin lightly, you are on very dangerous ground. If you are being entertained by watching the sin of others on television, you are guilty of sin.",

The end result of standing before the wrong image of God will lead the people into a theological perspective that is based on human optimism as opposed to sacrifice and truth. The true image of God represents Jesus Christ, the Cross , His sacrifice and all that is Holy. If we are going to know the true image of God, we will be led to a place where we are undone, where everything that we thought we were has to die. We must take joyfully the spoils of all of our religious goods and come before this image of the TRUE and Holy God. It is only in the presence of Jesus Christ that we are turned from image to image by the Glory of God.",

This river will reach homosexual communties and drug addicted people who are hungry and thirsty.
