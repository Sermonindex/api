A \"20th-century prophet\" many called him during his lifetime. For 31 years A.W.Tozer was pastor of Southside Alliance Church in Chicago. He was involved in the missionary alliance movement for most of his pulpit life. A.W. Tozer lived in the presence of God he saw clearly and he spoke as a prophet to the church. He sought for God's honor with the zeal of Elijah and mourned with Jeremiah at the apostasy of God's people. \r\n\r\nLeonard Ravenhill was a close friend of pastor and writer A. W. Tozer and spoke of him as one of the most influential voices in the Church in America. A.W. Tozer's materials are a mainstay in Evangelical churches in our day and he is one of the most quoted authors. He was a prophet in his day and his writings are even more influential in our day. One of his books: The Pursuit of God, has had over 1 million copies sold world-wide.",

Once we have been prepared to dwell in that fire, and for that fire to dwell in us, we can then go out and minister to lost mankind, bringing that fire and that life to people \u2013 it will flow out of us and bring life and light. Dr. Thompson says that is our eternal purpose in Christ \u2013 to be priests of God in His Kingdom forever. He discusses the unique unity that Adam and Eve shared, and the similarities with the unity that Christ and the Church are to have. This sermon will challenge you to look at your relationship with God in whole new ways (that sounds clich\u00e9, but it is very true in this case).",
