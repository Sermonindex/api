He shares on how churches have been influenced by the world and the pulpits have lost the seriousness of the fear of the Lord. He states that churches can now damn people and not save them when they do not preach an pure gospel of Jesus Christ. The Gospel of the apostate church speaks of the gospel of comfortable christianity.",
