They were haughty and did detestable things before me. Therefore I did away with them as you have seen\" Ezekiel 16:49. Jackie gives a short, deep and challenging call to go and minister to the poor with a broken heart. Her message is followed by personal testimonies. The recording ends in weeping over the hardness of our hearts and for the poor. Real ministry is to show people the Lord of the Word: \"They will know what He is like by what you are like. So you live it with your life and they will read you like an epistle.\" Whenever the destitute cry out, God will respond by sending a person, and it could be you. God works through people. Jackie also points out that the poor don't need training in evangelism, as evangelism is simply \"one poor man telling another poor man where to find bread\".",

Pride is an abomination to the Lord. Throughout history, God has judged nations for this, like Sodom, Gomorrah, Israel, and Judah, to name a few. How can America escape? This is a classic and heartfelt cry of the Watchman, warning one and all.",

They preach a polluted and diluted gospel that no longer deals with the Blood of Jesus and the Cross. Many christains are given over to spirtual harlotry and sit comfortable in their sin without any desire to be convicted or corrected but rather prefer to hear smooth messages. In the midst of this wickedness God is going to move supernaturally by His Spirit and cause us to cease from this apostasy and harlotry. In these last days God will remember His coveanat and pour out His grace and mercy and redeem a people onto Himself.",
