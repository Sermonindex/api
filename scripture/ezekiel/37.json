Brother Zac shows what a glorious life is available to every believer made possible by another Helper who is exactly like the first Helper--Jesus.  In a day when there is so many counterfeits and so much confusion about the Holy Spirit, Zac shows what God's Word says we should expect when He breathes upon us.",

He discusses in great detail the general progression of growth in a Christian\u2019s life, as typified by the depths of water detailed in Ezekiel 47. This sermon focuses on \u201cwater to the loins\u201d, which he says represents the struggles to put our own will to death, and shift toward God\u2019s will in our daily life.

His eschatological insight is a very needful truth to be realized in the body of Christ. \r\n\r\nArt was a prophetic voice insofar as he called his listeners to purposes in God that would affect both time and eternity, purposes that had to do with the glory of God in the Church.
