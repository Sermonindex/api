Brother Zac shows what a glorious life is available to every believer made possible by another Helper who is exactly like the first Helper--Jesus.  In a day when there is so many counterfeits and so much confusion about the Holy Spirit, Zac shows what God's Word says we should expect when He breathes upon us.",

            "description": "Dr. Thompson says once we hit Pentecost, the Holy Spirit has two main purposes in our life: one is to give us power to witness & minister, and the other is to give us victory over the sin in our life. He discusses in great detail the general progression of growth in a Christian\u2019s life, as typified by the depths of water detailed in Ezekiel 47. This sermon focuses on \u201cwater to the loins\u201d, which he says represents the struggles to put our own will to death, and shift toward God\u2019s will in our daily life.

God is looking for a Gideon\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s army of those that are willing to trust fully in His power and not in any might or power of their own.
