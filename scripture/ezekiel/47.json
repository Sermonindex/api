            "description": "Dr. Thompson says once we hit Pentecost, the Holy Spirit has two main purposes in our life: one is to give us power to witness & minister, and the other is to give us victory over the sin in our life. He discusses in great detail the general progression of growth in a Christian\u2019s life, as typified by the depths of water detailed in Ezekiel 47. This sermon focuses on \u201cwater to the loins\u201d, which he says represents the struggles to put our own will to death, and shift toward God\u2019s will in our daily life.

God is going to pour out His spirit and revive a spirit of prayer starting in the pulpits. This river will begin to bring life wherever it goes.There will be a supernatural stirring of gifts of faith and evangelism that have been lying dormant. This river will reach homosexual communties and drug addicted people who are hungry and thirsty. We are destined for the greatest movement of the Holy Spirit and there will be a multtitude of fish represnting the greatest harvest we have ever seen. The only thing that can hinderv the river is unbelief.",
