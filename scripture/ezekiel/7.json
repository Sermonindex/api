Milton Green was saved from a very hopeless situation of drugs, violence, he literally came to an end of his life almost and the Lord healed him and used him for His glory. He started to study the word of God and started to minister in many conventions including with James Robinson and Leonard Ravenhill.\r\nSome of his main Biblical burdens was to teach the whole counsel of God and to share how to be free from sin and carnality in Christian life. He clearly showed through his teachings on to recognize and have victory through Jesus Christ over the powers of darkness.",
