            "description": "Two issues, both serious are addressed. If you feel the heaviness of sin it is the mercy of God trying to draw you back to the cross so you can be saved from your sin. There are those who respond with remorse and repentance to this and those we do not because they have made peace with it. If you are sick of your sin, and weary of it, there is hope for God will never refuse a sincere heart. But if you are cold, and have no urgency to pray or read the word of God, no concern for the lost and are taking your sin lightly, you are on very dangerous ground. If you are being entertained by watching the sin of others on television, you are guilty of sin.",

            "description": "October 21, 2007 - When the church of Jesus Christ begins to portray a wrong image of God, it opens the door for uncalled and unfaithful men to take positions as spiritual leaders. The end result of standing before the wrong image of God will lead the people into a theological perspective that is based on human optimism as opposed to sacrifice and truth. The true image of God represents Jesus Christ, the Cross , His sacrifice and all that is Holy. If we are going to know the true image of God, we will be led to a place where we are undone, where everything that we thought we were has to die. We must take joyfully the spoils of all of our religious goods and come before this image of the TRUE and Holy God. It is only in the presence of Jesus Christ that we are turned from image to image by the Glory of God.",

            "description": "Brother EA gives a powerful urgent plea for repentance in the Church in America. The manifest presence has left the corporate Church gatherings, we need to turn back to the Lord in fasting, praying and weeping. Like in the days of Ezekiel there are so many hidden sins yet they have a sense of worship in that day. This hypocrisy needs to be stopped and for us to pray for revival confessing our need. We need such a solemn assembly in our day.",
