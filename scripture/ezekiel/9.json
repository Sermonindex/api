            "description": "This is a message about how God will not compete with idolatry for the hearts and minds of his people. Instead he will lift his glory from their lives. He reluctantly took his glory from Israel as illustrated in Ezekiel, and nobody even noticed, for the priests were busy with their secret things. Whatever you give your time and attention to the most is what is influencing your character and is becoming your idol. Too many go to church, going through the motions on Sunday and the rest of the week devote themselves to their own pursuits and pleasures and wonder why they can't feel God's presence. God desires to dwell among his people. But when they don't like to retain the knowledge of God, when they prefer an appearance of godliness with no power it will lead to destruction.",
