Secondly, Christians can testify of times of prayer when the presence and power of God fill the heart almost to bursting; it is not so with the Jehovah\u2019s Witness, for God is not with them.

We Christians should also always be green. A Christian should always be beautiful.

The fruit of the Holy Spirit in Gal 5:22 speaks of love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, faithfulness, self-control \u00e2\u20ac\u201c these fruit decorate the Christian far more beautifully than the Christmas tree.

Was a Christian missionary, teacher, writer, and advocate of economic development in impoverished nations. A spiritual crisis during this period\u2014as he described two decades later in what is probably his best-known recorded teaching, \"Ten Shekels and a Shirt\"--left Reidhead with the conviction that much of evangelicalism had adopted utilitarian and humanistic philosophies contradictory to Biblical teaching. The end of all being, he came to believe, was not the happiness of man, but the glorification of God. This theme would recur throughout his later teaching.\r\n\r\nSince Mr. Reidhead's death in 1992, Bible Teaching Ministries, Inc. continues under the leadership of his wife, Marjorie, and daughter, Virginia Teitt, a dedicated Board, and the many people who have donated time and talent after being changed by God\u2019s Word through this message.

He proceeds to explain that the logos of God is communicated fundamentally to man through his character.  We see the logos of God in how Jesus healed Malcus\u2019s ear, and how he endured such contradiction from rebel\u2019s and sinners.  It is within our psycho-space that we must fill our \u201cminds\u201d with this mind of Christ, which is full of love, joy, peace, patience, and the fruit of the Spirit, as we follow the Spirit, the logos of God step-wise begins to conform us into the likeness of the logos of Christ.

A spiritual crisis during this period\u2014as he described two decades later in what is probably his best-known recorded teaching, \"Ten Shekels and a Shirt\"--left Reidhead with the conviction that much of evangelicalism had adopted utilitarian and humanistic philosophies contradictory to Biblical teaching.

Many other things we might give thee warning of (gentle Reader) if we had not exceeded the measure of a Preface already. It remaineth, that we commend thee to God, and to the Spirit of his grace, which is able to build further than we can ask or think. He removeth the scales from our eyes, the vail from our hearts, opening our wits that we may understand his word, enlarging our hearts, yea correcting our affections, that we may love it to the end. Ye are brought unto fountains of living water which ye digged not; do not cast earth into them with the Philistines, neither prefer broken pits before them with the wicked Jews. [Gen 26:15. Jer 2:13.] Others have laboured, and you may enter into their labours; O receive not so great things in vain, O despise not so great salvation! Be not like swine to tread under foot so precious things, neither yet like dogs to tear and abuse holy things. Say not to our Saviour with the Gergesites, Depart out of our coast [Matt 8:34]; neither yet with Esau sell your birthright for a mess of pottage [Heb 12:16]. If light be come into the world, love not darkness more than light; if food, if clothing be offered, go not naked, starve not yourselves. Remember the advice of Nazianzene, \"It is a grievous thing\" (or dangerous) \"to neglect a great fair, and to seek to make markets afterwards:\" also the encouragement of S. Chrysostom, \"It is altogether impossible, that he that is sober\" (and watchful) \"should at any time be neglected:\" [S. Chrysost. in epist. ad Rom. cap. 14. oral. 26.]\r\nLastly, the admonition and menacing of S. Augustine, \"They that despise God's will inviting them, shall feel God's will taking vengeance of them.\" [S. August. ad artic. sibi falso object. Artic. 16.] It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God; [Heb 10:31] but a blessed thing it is, and will bring us to everlasting blessedness in the end, when God speaketh unto us, to hearken; when he setteth his word before us, to read it; when he stretcheth out his hand and calleth, to answer, Here am I, here we are to do thy will, O God. The Lord work a care and conscience in us to know him and serve him, that we may be acknowledged of him at the appearing of our Lord Jesus Christ, to whom with the holy Ghost, be all praise and thanksgiving. Amen.",

I am crucified with Christ: nevertheless I live; yet not I, but Christ liveth in me: and the life which I now live in the flesh I live by the faith of the Son of God, who loved me, and gave himself for me. (Gal. 2:20) The natural state of man apart from the born again experience is pure selfishness. It is selfishness without mixture. Charles G. Finney defined selfishness as \u201cregarding one's own happiness supremely, and seeking one's own good because it is his own.\u201d The selfish places his\/her happiness above all other interests and especially the glory of God. This selfishness is at the core of sin and must be crucified with Christ. Being crucified with Christ renders one free from sin and dead to sin.",

Native of the Kansas City, Mo area and reside now in Independence, MO with wife Anna.\r\nHe is the author of many books including the newest Televangelicalism. In this insightful and thought provoking book, Robert Wurtz II traces the history of Christian evangelism from the book of Acts to modern times. The contrast between pre-1900 and post-1900 evangelism is so sharp, that the book is divided into two sections: Part 1, the pre-Billy Sunday era and Part 2, the post-Billy Sunday evangelistic era. This book is a must-read for anyone that has concerns about issues such as \"the sinner's prayer\" or shallow concepts of conversion.",

This passage of Scripture consumed David for months and he studied it from every angle.  This is absolutely the best sermon on this topic of righteousness that I have heard, separating real righteousness from much of the emotional righteousness that many seem to subscribe to this day. Jesus said you would know the truth and the truth shall set you free. Sanctification is the Spirit of Christ in us making us to become what God in reality sees you to be already, by faith. Making us what we could never be on our own, holy. The gift of righteousness is the Spirit of Christ in you. When you yield to him and let him have control, he makes you what he is. The Lord doesn't want you to come to him in condemnation and guilt. He wants the truth of his righteousness and his love to set you free.",
