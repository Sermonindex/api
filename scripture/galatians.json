Secondly, Christians can testify of times of prayer when the presence and power of God fill the heart almost to bursting; it is not so with the Jehovah\u2019s Witness, for God is not with them. Thirdly, check whether the Jehovah\u2019s Witness\u2019 \u201cgospel\u201d conforms to the Gospel that the Apostle Paul preached, using the above scriptures.",

            "description": "In the ancient language the fir referred to fire, an ancient symbol for the spirit. The tree also points upwards. Overseas most trees lose their leaves in winter. There are songs about this fir tree in winter and that it is green even in winter. When I first went to Germany to preach I was struck at how brown the trees look, they looked burnt but the fir tree remains evergreen. Evergreens symbolized the everlasting fire in us. We Christians should also always be green. A Christian should always be beautiful. You can read about the beauty of the faith in Gal 5 like love, patience etc. Also go and read the works of the flesh. The fruit of the Holy Spirit in Gal 5:22 speaks of love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, faithfulness, self-control \u00e2\u20ac\u201c these fruit decorate the Christian far more beautifully than the Christmas tree. The Lord said, \"If they do this to me a green branch how much more to those who are dry branches.\" The works of the dry tree are evident: immorality, defilement, witchcraft, enmity, strife, fits of anger, rivalries, divisions, orgies and things like this. Those who do such things will not inherit the kingdom of God. This tree speaks of the attractiveness of the Christian.",

Because of past wounds in their lives, some fear God will reject them as people sometimes have. You can determine to live a new life in Christ, secure and have the assurance you so desperately need. When the Word comes and voices arise to condemn you, you can shoot them down (Is. 54:17). God loves you enough to not let you by with sin that will destroy you. Come to him for cleansing, forgiveness, and peace and rest.",

Animals, plants, humans, every living thing has what he acutely titles, \u201cpsycho-space.\u201d  The psycho space being the realm in which each living thing has the capacity for some degree of thought or communication.  He proceeds to explain that the logos of God is communicated fundamentally to man through his character.  We see the logos of God in how Jesus healed Malcus\u2019s ear, and how he endured such contradiction from rebel\u2019s and sinners.  It is within our psycho-space that we must fill our \u201cminds\u201d with this mind of Christ, which is full of love, joy, peace, patience, and the fruit of the Spirit, as we follow the Spirit, the logos of God step-wise begins to conform us into the likeness of the logos of Christ.  Smith also shares a great testimony how an SS Nazi officer was converted to the faith when he shared with him about the strength of Christ character.",

This is absolutely the best sermon on this topic of righteousness that I have heard, separating real righteousness from much of the emotional righteousness that many seem to subscribe to this day. Jesus said you would know the truth and the truth shall set you free. Sanctification is the Spirit of Christ in us making us to become what God in reality sees you to be already, by faith. Making us what we could never be on our own, holy. The gift of righteousness is the Spirit of Christ in you. When you yield to him and let him have control, he makes you what he is.

We must be prepared to lay down our life and taking up His cross. The most important need in our lives must be to know Him. David Wilkerson preaches one of his greatest messages while suffering with the flu.  You will hear him struggle through this message but in his weakness, God made him strong.  He preaches on the true gospel of Jesus Christ and what it entails.  As a teaser; The church has to be a place of death before it can be a place of life.",

John 15 tells us about the pruning that all Christians will go through during their walk in and with Christ.  It is God\u2019s purpose for all of His to bear good fruit and part of bearing good fruit is the pruning process.  Learn the divine destiny of each and every Christian from past to future.",

Have you removed the stepping-stones to sin? Have you burned the plow and the oxen? Or are you telling yourself you can handle certain weights in your life? When you see sin as God sees it you will hate it and be repulsed by it. You will do whatever it takes to keep sin from gaining an advantage over you. In this message we explore an essential key to achieving victory in your life.",

Walking in the spirit simply means you make no decisions until you hear from Him. We surrender our will and give complete control over to His government. The key to this walk is found in three words - JUST SAY YES- Say yes to all the promises of God and believe the Holy Spirit to accomplish this in and through you.",

Sodom and Gomorrah were totally burnt to ashes that there was not a trace left, and so it will go with those who practice this sin of homosexuality and these preachers who promote this lifestyle and lead others astray. There are so-called Christians who are just like these people in Jude, uprooted trees, wild waves of the sea, without fruit, twice dead. They cast up the foam of their own shame. The blackest darkness is reserved for them forever. Such ministers will reap a double hell, forever.",
