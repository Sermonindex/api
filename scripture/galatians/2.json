I am crucified with Christ: nevertheless I live; yet not I, but Christ liveth in me: and the life which I now live in the flesh I live by the faith of the Son of God, who loved me, and gave himself for me. (Gal. 2:20) The natural state of man apart from the born again experience is pure selfishness. It is selfishness without mixture. Charles G. Finney defined selfishness as \u201cregarding one's own happiness supremely, and seeking one's own good because it is his own.\u201d The selfish places his\/her happiness above all other interests and especially the glory of God. This selfishness is at the core of sin and must be crucified with Christ. Being crucified with Christ renders one free from sin and dead to sin.",

Native of the Kansas City, Mo area and reside now in Independence, MO with wife Anna.\r\nHe is the author of many books including the newest Televangelicalism. In this insightful and thought provoking book, Robert Wurtz II traces the history of Christian evangelism from the book of Acts to modern times. The contrast between pre-1900 and post-1900 evangelism is so sharp, that the book is divided into two sections: Part 1, the pre-Billy Sunday era and Part 2, the post-Billy Sunday evangelistic era. This book is a must-read for anyone that has concerns about issues such as \"the sinner's prayer\" or shallow concepts of conversion.",
