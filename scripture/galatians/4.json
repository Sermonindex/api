Isaac and Isaac contrast believers under the old covenant (done in the strength of the flesh) and those of the new covenant, that which is done supernaturally.  God's tests come to see whether He is first in our life.  Abraham went against human reason, counted the cost, and obeyed God in offering Isaac, the first mention of worship and also a picture of the resurrection.",

This will defeat much of the work of the enemy in trying to hinder your walk with God. A must hear for every Christian.",

This passage of Scripture consumed David for months and he studied it from every angle.  This is absolutely the best sermon on this topic of righteousness that I have heard, separating real righteousness from much of the emotional righteousness that many seem to subscribe to this day. Jesus said you would know the truth and the truth shall set you free. Sanctification is the Spirit of Christ in us making us to become what God in reality sees you to be already, by faith. Making us what we could never be on our own, holy. The gift of righteousness is the Spirit of Christ in you. When you yield to him and let him have control, he makes you what he is. The Lord doesn't want you to come to him in condemnation and guilt. He wants the truth of his righteousness and his love to set you free.",

This message suggests that God ALWAYS asks too much and it is never God's design or desire that we should ever be in a place where we think that what God is requiring is something that we can bring about in our own strength or by our own power. When God first speaks His promises to us there is strong expectancy for the fulfillment of that promise. But as time passes on and we are still waiting the possible begins to seem impossible. It is in these times of delay that our flesh will begin to think that we can make things happen in our own time and our own way. God in His mercy will bring us through the refiner's fire so we can let go of all that we think we are and what we think we are supposed to do. He will refine our gifts and our calling until He has complete ownership and lordship over them.",
