This passage of Scripture consumed David for months and he studied it from every angle.  This is absolutely the best sermon on this topic of righteousness that I have heard, separating real righteousness from much of the emotional righteousness that many seem to subscribe to this day. Jesus said you would know the truth and the truth shall set you free. Sanctification is the Spirit of Christ in us making us to become what God in reality sees you to be already, by faith. Making us what we could never be on our own, holy. The gift of righteousness is the Spirit of Christ in you. When you yield to him and let him have control, he makes you what he is. The Lord doesn't want you to come to him in condemnation and guilt. He wants the truth of his righteousness and his love to set you free.",
