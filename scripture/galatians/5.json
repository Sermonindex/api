He says God will not have people who are not under law \u2013 the Holy Spirit is our Law. We are either under the Law of Moses or under the Law of the Spirit. (55 minutes, 58 seconds)",

There are songs about this fir tree in winter and that it is green even in winter. When I first went to Germany to preach I was struck at how brown the trees look, they looked burnt but the fir tree remains evergreen. Evergreens symbolized the everlasting fire in us. We Christians should also always be green. A Christian should always be beautiful. You can read about the beauty of the faith in Gal 5 like love, patience etc. Also go and read the works of the flesh. The fruit of the Holy Spirit in Gal 5:22 speaks of love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, faithfulness, self-control \u00e2\u20ac\u201c these fruit decorate the Christian far more beautifully than the Christmas tree. The Lord said, \"If they do this to me a green branch how much more to those who are dry branches.\" The works of the dry tree are evident: immorality, defilement, witchcraft, enmity, strife, fits of anger, rivalries, divisions, orgies and things like this. Those who do such things will not inherit the kingdom of God. This tree speaks of the attractiveness of the Christian.",

            "description": "In this message, Dr. Smith explains how all of nature contains language.  Animals, plants, humans, every living thing has what he acutely titles, \u201cpsycho-space.\u201d  The psycho space being the realm in which each living thing has the capacity for some degree of thought or communication.  He proceeds to explain that the logos of God is communicated fundamentally to man through his character.  We see the logos of God in how Jesus healed Malcus\u2019s ear, and how he endured such contradiction from rebel\u2019s and sinners.  It is within our psycho-space that we must fill our \u201cminds\u201d with this mind of Christ, which is full of love, joy, peace, patience, and the fruit of the Spirit, as we follow the Spirit, the logos of God step-wise begins to conform us into the likeness of the logos of Christ.  Smith also shares a great testimony how an SS Nazi officer was converted to the faith when he shared with him about the strength of Christ character.",

Wilkerson did much study of husbandry, inspired by the Holy Spirit to search this out. God wants his children to be bearing the fruit of righteousness-ever increasing in Christ-likeness. John 15 tells us about the pruning that all Christians will go through during their walk in and with Christ.  It is God\u2019s purpose for all of His to bear good fruit and part of bearing good fruit is the pruning process.  Learn the divine destiny of each and every Christian from past to future.",

It is the cancer which is eating away at the church, but it is no secret. In fact, it is so non-secretive that it is written on almost every page of the New Testament. And yet, because the heart of man is deceitful and desperately wicked, and because we are so bent on our own way, we do not see (or seeing we do not believe) that the basic message of the New Testament is LOVE!",
