God used him to have a powerful prophetic insight into the end-times and the coming suffering of the jewish people before the great accepting of Jesus as Messiah. His eschatological insight is a very needful truth to be realized in the body of Christ. \r\n\r\nArt was a prophetic voice insofar as he called his listeners to purposes in God that would affect both time and eternity, purposes that had to do with the glory of God in the Church.   Frequently, his messages called the Church to an awareness of the Last Days [End-times] in such a way that made that time seem imminent and at the door.",

God has built in instincts and traits (micro-systems) so that animals behave and do things which really wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be possible through evolution. How great a God we serve, how wise in His creation surely the creation shows forth His handiwork. Elohim (plural) trinity of God. V26 let us make man in our (plural, trinity) image. If God created me with a capacity of choice unless I had the ability to choose. So freedom of choice is given to men and the opposite of what good is given so people can choice what is actually good. God influences choices because He loves and cares for us, but we have the right to not choose God. God will not force His choice upon us, He is an gentleman. In pictures of Christ there is an attempt to define Him in form. It is more God honoring according to the commandment of not making an graven image of God to not make any image of Jesus Christ. Gods will for original man is to be fruitful and multiply and to subdue the earth. All the animals at that point lived off the grasses and vegetation, there was no carnivous animals. God rested meaning that He was not exhausted but that the creation was completed. This chapter gives the first look at creation, but the next chapter gives an more detailed version of the creation of man. And God is revealed in a different name: Jehovah. This different name of God curtails the relationship between God and man. What is important is what did God say not who did He say it through.",

And if there is, what is it? Here we read that God created man in His own image. They were created in God's image - male and female.

It is important that our lives speak louder than our voices. Does the word change our lives? I pray that our lives will speak louder than our words. That is important to me. We have enough of hypocrisy. We say we are Christians but we get angry and don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t do anything about it. Genesis 1:26 God wanted man to rule over creation so that man would be the manager of creation. When God created man he wanted man to be like Him. He wanted to put man on earth so that he would represent God on earth. That was the heart of God when he created man. That was the duty of man on earth. When He created man He wanted man to be restored to what he should be. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s why he gave Moses the commandments so that he would be in the image of God. \"I give them my commandments so that they can be in my image and likeness.\"",

Stephen Kaung is a Chinese Chrisitan speaker and writer, and now living in Richmond, Virgina. At an early age was converted to Christianity and was active in the Methodist Church in China, with home his father was a minister. He first met watchman need in the early 1930's and joined Nee's indigenous christian work full-time, working with him until 1949 when he left China and became involved with Christian work in other ares of the Far East.\r\n\r\nStephen Kaung worked very closely with T Austin-Sparks until his death in 1972. His burden has been to allow a testimony of the Lord in the local assembly, and to help the saints see the great importance of the Church as God intended it. Stephen Kaung's major work has been to translate the writings of Watchman Nee into English, over 50 titles which have been published by his own organisation, Christian Fellowship Publishers (CFP), In Richmond, Virgina.",
