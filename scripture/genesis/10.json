            "description": "In Chapter ten a lot of the genealogy names really can be traced to the starting of peoples and civilizations, i.e. Chinese. Nimrod was the beginning of the false system of religion in the world. There is much of the historic church that has borrowed and used many of the characteristics of the Babylonian religion of old. The worship of stars began in the tower of Babel, and astrology was started in those days. In the days of pegleg the earth was divided, some people try and say that the actual physical separation of the continents happened in his day. But rather pegleg lived during the tower of Babel and in his day the peoples were divided into different languages and speeches. The original language in the world was possibly Hebrew, because the early names in the genealogies are Hebrew with Hebrew meanings. Babel was rebellion against Gods command to be fruitful and multiply and subdue the earth. It is possible that God could have put the message of the gospel in the heavens but whatever God does the devil always try\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s to pervert and misuse. God has placed the stars in the heavens for signs and seasons. Many of the primitive cultures had very complex language systems. It doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t matter how primitive an culture is there is an ability to communicate ideas, this fact separates man from the animal kingdom.",
