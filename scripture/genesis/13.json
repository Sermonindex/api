God is working in our midst should be something of a conscious presence of every Christian. Before Sodom and Gomorrah was destroyed the Dead Sea was inhabitable by fish and animals. Now in the present day the Dead Sea does not support life but is very rich in mineral wealth. Sin can be very exciting and thrilling and pleasurable, but it eventuates in death. The path of sin leads to death. In the ancient times they counted the amount of stars in the sky, which were approximately 6000+ (which were probably stars visible to the naked eye). Shinar = Babylon. 13= the number of Satan. Which is the number of rebellion. That is why 13 is considered an unlucky number. The number 13 is a very significant number in spiritism. In the tower of Babel they used pitch, which is another word for tar (oil). One person who read his bible thought about this and assumed if they had to get tar there much be oil in that land and therefore mined for oil and became very rich in the modern days.",

He shares a prophetic call to repentance for believers to leave Sodom and Gomorrah in their hearts. There is a great need for preaching on sin, powerful prophetic messages that will lay hearts bare before a Holy God. Judgment day will come for all, we must live in light of it.",

Fueled by his own dramatic deliverance from drugs, alcohol and crime in 1975, Steve Hill dedicates his life to spreading the gospel of Jesus Christ around the world. His passion to help those who are hurting and his pursuit of genuine, God-breathed revival have only intensified after years of missionary work, church planting, and evangelistic crusades.\r\nThrough a vision, God gave Steve Hill a wake up call for everyone. Heresies and false teachings are becoming a threat to millions! Now he shares this revelation and provides the steps we must take to avoid destruction. Speaking of the new book: Spiritual Avalanche, Jack Hayford says: \"A message deserving our ready welcome as a 'word' from the heart of God!\"",
