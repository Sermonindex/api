It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the same in revelation of us being called to go back to our first love. God always calls us back to the first things. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a tragic day when things wane and when we start to act like those things aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t exciting as they used to be. God is working in our midst should be something of a conscious presence of every Christian. Before Sodom and Gomorrah was destroyed the Dead Sea was inhabitable by fish and animals. Now in the present day the Dead Sea does not support life but is very rich in mineral wealth. Sin can be very exciting and thrilling and pleasurable, but it eventuates in death. The path of sin leads to death. In the ancient times they counted the amount of stars in the sky, which were approximately 6000+ (which were probably stars visible to the naked eye). Shinar = Babylon. 13= the number of Satan. Which is the number of rebellion. That is why 13 is considered an unlucky number. The number 13 is a very significant number in spiritism. In the tower of Babel they used pitch, which is another word for tar (oil). One person who read his bible thought about this and assumed if they had to get tar there much be oil in that land and therefore mined for oil and became very rich in the modern days.",
