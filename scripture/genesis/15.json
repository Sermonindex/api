This is the first time also that says He is the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I AM\u00e2\u20ac\u009d the shield and great reward. It is amazing how sometimes we can rethink vivid memories and experiences; this is what happened to Abraham. He was having an flash back from the prior war with the kings of Sodom and Gomorrah, and God comforted him saying I am your shield. The first thing God says to Abraham is \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcFear not\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 when we are in right standing with God we never have to worry, God is our shield, if we have the Lord we have defense. God wants to be our protector and provider. Lord God = Adoni Jehovah. Adoni is the title of God = Lord. This name of God signifies relationship with God. Jesus = name Kurios (Lord) = title. And He believed in the Lord and God counted it for righteousness. This phrase is repeated in the New Testament many times. Our righteousness is imputed to us as we believe in the promise of God. He does not account my prayer, works, for righteousness but my belief. Paul the apostle talked of his works of the law but that never made him righteous before God.",

We all have a sin nature in us that desires to make choices apart from the will of God. God gave us the law as a school master to prove to us that we can't keep it. When we try to struggle our way out of a situation we are being God in that area. When we try to defeat sin in our own strength we are being God in that area. God the Father and Jesus Christ made a covenant with each other to put an end to sin and the power it has over us. It is only when we bend our knee to God and put our faith in the finished work of the Cross the struggle stops and God can be God to us. WE don't make promises to God, He makes them to us and He keeps them. It is not about works, it is all about faith in what Christ has already done.",

Bob's involvement with the Calvary Chapels began in 1971, when he and his wife Dini visited Calvary Chapel Costa Mesa on a Sunday evening. They were deeply touched by the life-giving teaching of the word of God, the simple worship \"in Spirit and in truth\", and the profound expressions of the love of the Lord among the saints. Upon returning to Dallas, they regularly obtained Pastor Chuck Smith's teaching tapes and eventually became daily listeners of the Word for Today on the radio.\r\n\r\nSince 1993, Bob had been teaching at Calvary Chapel and other church fellowships across the country and overseas (including, Seminars, Pastors' Conferences, Church Services, Leadership Conferences, Retreats, and Schools of Evangelism\/Ministry). He has taught numerous classes at Calvary Chapel Bible College (both at its former location in Twin Peaks, CA and its current location in Murrieta Hot Springs, CA) as well as at the extension campuses of Costa Mesa, Vista, San Diego, El Cajon, and others.
