God called brother Zac Poonen to a new work early on in his Christian experience. The movement is now called Christian Fellowship Churches where the New Covenant of New Testament Christianity is clearly preached. \r\n\r\nBrother Zac Poonen has written 25 books most of them being on the deeper Christian life. Many of these have been translated into a number of languages and have been circulated widely around the world. He clearly and passionately shares the  narrow way of Christian discipleship that is neglected by so many modern preachers.",

In the Old Testament specifically the angel of the Lord is referred to as having a divine nature. He is holy as God is holy. It is believed that He is the Lord Jesus revealing Himself to man. He has always been. When the Pharisees accused Jesus, He said, \"Abraham rejoiced to see my day\", and, \"before Abraham was, I am\". Sarah took the matter of her barrenness into her own hands and handed her handmaid to her husband as wife. It's a cursed thing for people not to be able to wait upon God. When Hagar saw that she conceived she despised her mistress, and Sarah suffered. She blamed Abraham and Hagar for her suffering which she brought upon herself. But Abraham told her that it's her slave and it was her idea, so she should do what she thinks best. So Sarah made life impossibly difficult for Hagar. Hagar was also haughty, obstinate and irritated.",
