It is the sublime prophecy of God\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s authority as Judge \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the Judge of all the earth, and the revelation of the supreme royal position of Christ, the Messiah. Daniel was God\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s prophet during the period of Babylonian captivity. The Gentiles thought they were so mighty and powerful. Their despotic rulers and emperors thought they were independent of the God of heaven. The wicked nations thought that their kings had the ultimate and final authority. The kings and the princes of the Gentile world positioned themselves as if they were unpunishable. The prophecy here is a revelation from heaven that God, Who created the earth and all the inhabitants therein, has not abandoned the world to His creatures. This revelation upholds the truth known to patriarchs and prophets from the earliest of times that God is Judge. The God of heaven is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153the Judge of all the earth\u00e2\u20ac\u009d (Genesis 18:25).",

Homosexuality is an abomination \u2013 but what about the people that are bound in this sin? Where do we draw the line? We must seek the Lord and cry out to God with a heart full of compassion. Out of Genesis 18, Wilkerson preaches on the sins of Sodom and Gomorrah and puts this in a message for this day and age.  He lays out the comparison of then and now.

Violence was rampant, and their sexual perversions were not hidden. Their sin reached unto heaven and God could no longer keep silent. God decided to destroy them, but he was looking for someone to turn away His fierce wrath from them. Our society today has surpassed Sodom and Gomorrah in sin. God's judgement is surely coming, even as Billy Graham once said that, \"if God does not judge America, He will have to apologise to Sodom and Gomorrah.\" Lot lived amongst them, but was no testimony. His only concern was for his own safety. He wanted to be saved, and considered the others beyond hope. Many Christians today live similar lives. They consider the homosexuals, rapists and murderers beyond salvation. They pray God's judgement upon them, and not for their salvation.",
