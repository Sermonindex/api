Abraham's lapse in Gerar is a warning that following great experiences or revelation from God to be very careful.  In our judgments of others we need to also be careful, for we may have judged Abraham a liar but God called him a prophet.",

            "description": "Abraham pleads (intercedes) for God being just. God is always just. One of the ways Satan tries to lie to unbelievers is that how can God be just if people are suffering, etc. Abraham saw an inequity that it would not be right to judge the righteous with the wicked. But it must be remembered that Gods ways are higher then our ways and His thoughts higher to our thoughts. So therefore some things that seem to be unjust in our minds are just in the eyes of God.  When the Church is persecuted that persecution is rooted in the world and the worldly system. Jesus said that as it is in the day of lot then it will be in the days of the Son of man. Peter also shows that lot was delivered and how much more can God deliver the godly in Christ Jesus that follow Him. Hospitality is extremely important in the culture of Abraham, etc. The women did a lot of work in those days towards fixing meals etc. To sit in the gate of a city was a place of honor and Lot was there. Know them = to know them in a sexual lewd manner. For Lot to sacrifice his 2 daughters (their virginity) speaks possibly of the low regard for women. It is really through Christianity that women have been given a more elevated place in society. In Greece which was a quite cultured society women were placed just above slaves in status.",

Spiritual laziness and prayerlessness will lead to the loss of passion for Christ and the inability to feed the sheep from the treasure of the Word. We can't know the heart of God until we let God lead us to the place of crucifixion of self. Let him preserve you from selfishness, and settling for less than he has for you. We are called to overcome, to rise above the beggardly elements of this world and stand victorious.",
