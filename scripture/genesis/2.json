He was born in Newtownards, County Down, Ireland in 1911. In his book Tramp after God, he tells of living for more than three years as a tramp abusing alcohol and involved in crime. Willie Mullan had a religious conversion and from that time forward he decided he would strive to serve God.\r\n\r\n In 1953 Willie Mullan was called to Lurgan Baptist church, and in August of that year he commenced the work in Lurgan. One of his great accomplishments during this time was the Tuesday night Bible class. Every Tuesday night hundreds attended to hear the exposition of the Word. In 1957 William Hewitt and a team of helpers commenced the tape recordings of the Bible class. At least 1500 of these recordings remain until this day.",

The Sabbath days are a shadow of things to come, its not the substance. Jesus has become our Sabbath, we have entered into His rest. The righteousness of God is by faith by resting in Jesus and what He has done for us on the cross. It would be extremely healthy for us one day a week to relax once a week. We keep going all the time we need to stop and just rest one day a week, it would be healthy but wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t make you any more spiritual. JHVH this was the form of Gods name because of Godly reverence. YAWEH is possibly the right vowels. LORD = Elohim, Yahweh (as a name) Lord = Adoni (as a title). The earth was watered by an mist before the flood. There is no way to find out where the garden of Eden was, the whole earths form was changed during the flood and other large natural events. During the time of Pegleg the earth was divided, could that mean the earth started to change and separate? The garden of Eden appears to be somewhere in Babylon which is modern day Araq.  Life would be boring if there was nothing to do therefore God had man working in the garden of Eden to tend and care for it. Really an child of God has a true care for the nature and the world that God has created compared to even an humanist, because their humanism is based ultimately in selfishness. Dying thou shalt surely die. So it was a 2 fold death, a spiritual death and an beginning of an physical death. Where ever the gospel of God goes there is a freedom of choice and in nations and places where the gospel doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t exist there is a lose of the freedom of choice and an slavery. To make the power of choice meaningful he had to give the option and choice to disobey. This power of choice makes man something more then a robot. You could never receive meaningful love or devotion from a robot, so for our relationship to God to be meaningful there has to be choice.",

He has raised up many pastors who are a part of the Calvary Chapel movement now and where he pastors the large Costa Mesa church in California.\r\n\r\nThe Calvary Chapel movement is based of simple principles that Chuck Smith taught over the years such as: The priority of agape love, Simple fellowship amongst the saints, the breaking of bread, the teaching of God's word chapter by chapter and verse by verse. And lastly and most importantly the principle not by might nor by power but by my spirit saith the Lord.",

Wilder-Smith uses one of his greatest analogies concerning the impossibility of using the scientific method to perceive or interact with heaven and hell.  The analogy comes in the form of understanding that there is no way to interact with a Black Hole, yet we know that they exist by inference.  So also, we are able to interact with eternal realities by inference.  Through this analogy, Smith reveals the lie concerning our inability to scientifically measure heaven or hell to prove it's existence because you cannot scientifically tamper with a black hole in any way yet scientists believe in them just the same.   The second analogy he explains about dimensionality is that a two dimensional person would be incapable of capturing a three dimensional person, because they would always use their higher dimensionality to give their captors the slip.  So also, Jesus gave death the slip.  Smith explains that this life is about preparation for glorification, as the power that comes with a resurrected body would be too dangerous to place within the hands of immoral people.   So if we suffer with him, so also shall we reign with him.",
