Isaac and Isaac contrast believers under the old covenant (done in the strength of the flesh) and those of the new covenant, that which is done supernaturally.  God's tests come to see whether He is first in our life.  Abraham went against human reason, counted the cost, and obeyed God in offering Isaac, the first mention of worship and also a picture of the resurrection.",

            "description": "As he had said and did as He had spoken. God always does what he says. Abraham laughed first and God called Him laughter, Sarah even laughed when she heard about the child from the tent. God heard the voice of the lad, so Ishmael was praying as well as Hagar. It is interesting that God heard the prayers of Ishmael rather then Hagar. The Arabs and Israel are linked together through Abraham; Ishmael is the father of the Arabic people. The enticements for sinning are from the flesh not from God. God can test us but never will he lead us into doing a sin or sending direct temptation. By our own lusts we are drawn away and enticed. The first time the word love is used in the bible is the fatherly love, the father for the son. This is a type of Father God\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s love for His Son Jesus Christ. There are a lot of works that are done in the flesh that are going to be consumed; they will be wood, hay, and stubble. It is the motives for it, if it draws any praise and glory to ourselves then it will be your reward already. Much of what we do for God is really done for our own glory benefit or recognition. God does not recognize our works in the flesh.",

We were barren and withered, dead in our sins, but Jesus came and brought us life. Now we can display the fruits of righteous. The Bible says my heart is full of joyous laughter because I've found salvation through the Lord Jesus. In Hebrews 11 we read of the faith of Abraham and Sarah.",

A praying woman who spends time regularly with the Lord has an orderly home. If there is chaos, and confusion, it is because of a lack of prayer, most of the time. This is a firm, but loving rebuke to those who do not pray as they know they are supposed to. Issues as to why the lack of prayer are addressed in a helpful way.",
