We face this same test not in the areas we obey so easily but in immediate obedience in the things God speaks to our hearts in secret.  Our worship is not measured by our correct doctrine or what songs we sing but whether we give to God that which costs us something; it's our attitude towards God that matters most.",

SPURGEON AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153And Abraham said, My son, God will provide himself a lamb for a burnt offering.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d \u00e2\u20ac\u201d Genesis 22:8. How stern the trial; how striking the triumph; how sublime, both in action and passion, was the faith of Abraham in that terrible crisis. It pleased God to try him on a very tender point. Abraham had received a great promise, on the fulfillment of which he greatly relied. Year after year elapsed, but no sign of the long-looked-for child appeared. At length old age crept over the patriarch and his wife. Still he looked steadfastly for the promise, because he believed implicitly in the Promiser. He considered not the infirmities of his own body, nor the deadness of Sarah's womb; but he waited patiently, nothing doubting that God would in due time, according to his promise, give him a son. What marvel that this son, when born, should be the object of his fondest affection! Moreover, a strange halo of hope gathers round the lad's head, for God has made him the heir of a covenant. It is in Isaac and in Isaac's seed that God will fulfill his covenant which he has made with Abraham. Nay, something more mysterious still is linked with that youth's life. It is in him that all the nations of the earth must be blessed. And now when the Lord says, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Take thy son, thine only son Isaac, whom thou lovest,\u00e2\u20ac\u009d there is a cut in every word at the most tender part of Abraham's soul.",

Pastor Hession shows there are 3 key sayings in these verses, 1: Where is the Lamb? when we are stubborn and self willed where are the lamb like qualities in us that marked the life of our Lord?  2: God will provide Himself a Lamb,  this He did in the form of his Son, the Lord Jesus, Who was the only One Who could offer up a sweet smelling savour to God.  3: He shall be accepted for Him, here is the wonder of His substitution for us that God credits to us the sweet savour that ascended up from Calvary.",
