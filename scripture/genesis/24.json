God called brother Zac Poonen to a new work early on in his Christian experience. The movement is now called Christian Fellowship Churches where the New Covenant of New Testament Christianity is clearly preached. \r\n\r\nBrother Zac Poonen has written 25 books most of them being on the deeper Christian life. Many of these have been translated into a number of languages and have been circulated widely around the world. He clearly and passionately shares the  narrow way of Christian discipleship that is neglected by so many modern preachers.",

The woman that is being asked by the servant is being asked to take a large step of faith. The chances for the servant to be successful to get a women to come back was a small or very uncertain. The servant re-asks the question to ensure that if a woman would not come because he wanted to get the terms of the vow clear. The servant has faith and prays to God for Him to let a certain women be the one for Abraham\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s son Isaac. The servant makes a fleece prayer before God. It is interesting that sometimes it takes a long time for our prayers to be answered. Sometimes are prayers are done immediately. Why does sometimes it come immediately and sometimes takes a long time. The answer is simply that God is in control of things; he is in control of the issues and timing of our prayers and needs. Every right thing you pray for God wanted to give it to you before you pray. Every good and perfect gift is from above.",

Pastor Chuck was used in the Jesus People revival where he was used along with others to minister to the hippy young people. They saw a work of the Spirit where many were added to the church and discipled. He has raised up many pastors who are a part of the Calvary Chapel movement now and where he pastors the large Costa Mesa church in California.\r\n\r\nThe Calvary Chapel movement is based of simple principles that Chuck Smith taught over the years such as: The priority of agape love, Simple fellowship amongst the saints, the breaking of bread, the teaching of God's word chapter by chapter and verse by verse. And lastly and most importantly the principle not by might nor by power but by my spirit saith the Lord.",

Abraham asked his servant to go and find a wife for His son. The servant asked if he should take his son there if the woman refuses to follow him but Abraham solemnly warned him to never do that. Jesus taught us to pray that God's will be done (Matthew 6:9-13). Jesus also said that those who do the will of His Father are His brother and sister and mother (Matthew 12:50). That should fill us with joy and also help us understand why those who do not do His will deserve hell indeed.",

How was this servant to know who the right wife would be? There were so many possibities. Without God it was impossible. But with God it was easy. This matter is very important.

We are told that they will come from the east and west and sit together with Abraham, Isaac and Jacob at the tables of heaven (Matt 8:11-12). But what is shocking is that that passage goes on to say that the children of the Kingdom will be cast out! Every child of God should test and examine himself that he is not counted with those who are cast out of the Kingdom of Heaven. Abraham was 75 years old when God gave him a promise and told him to leave the land of his forefathers. And he left everything (Gen 12:1-4). We can learn so much from him. If we want to follow Jesus, we must also leave everything behind. But his father Terah wanted to go with him. He respected his father and allowed him to go with him. He was promised that although he was 75 years old and had no children, his offspring will be as the stars of heaven (Gen 15:5, 22:17, 26:4, 12:7). Abraham also took Lot along as a nephew and son, since he had no children of his own. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s so easy to make a mistake. Lot was a very nice person and it was difficult for Abraham to refuse. They traveled as far as Haran and settled there (Gen 11:31). God stopped speaking to Abraham until his father passed away. When his father had died, then God spoke again to him to continue (Gen 11:32 - 12:1). When God calls you, don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t take anything along except what God says you should take along.",
