            "description": "What Abraham gave to Isaac was not a doctrine but a living faith.  The struggle of Jacob and Esau in the womb depicts the struggle in the believer between flesh and spirit.  God's sovereign choice of Jacob was not according to works, which has principles of rest for us, such as being delivered from competition and jealousy over ministry with others in the church.  Isaac's partiality at age 80 is a warning to be steadfast to the spiritual zeal of younger years.",
