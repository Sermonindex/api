            "description": "It is tragic to be in the case of Isaac to be in the way of an invalid. When the body cannot really function or really cant work but the spirit that remains in the body is a hard thing for the person who is in the body and for the people that have to take care of him. God thinks with a for-knowledge. We cannot think in the same way as God. If we select someone we cannot ever see how the person is going to work out, but God knows the end of men. Therefore God can elect a person he has for-knowledge of so that he can fulfill his purposes. The way that Isaac asks Esau to get a savory meat was a cheap way to get a blessing, and his wife (Rebecca) knowing that Jacob would used of the Lord better then Esau. Isaac blessed Jacob instead of Esau, was it Gods will that Jacob should be blessed? Yes. Why is it that we think that God cannot do His work without us? Such is not the case; God can accomplish his purposes apart from us, and will if necessary. The work of God is never dependent on our deception (i.e. Jacob). If it is a true work of God it will be done, God is able and is not dependent on us especially on money situations. It takes abit from the romance of this story that Jacob was 75 years old when he was about to run away from his home.",

Listen to what she said when she wanted the blessing for her child. It was something beautiful. When she heard her husband was going to bless her oldest son, she said. \"My son, Jacob, must take it. He must have the blessing.\" What did she do? She came to him and said, \"Now therefore my son, obey my voice according to what I command you\" (Gen 27:8). Here was a woman who wanted the best for her son. Do we have such mothers in our midst? She commanded him. She didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t say you can choose whether you follow the Lord or not. You are old enough you can decide who you will serve. She had a zeal in her heart and she commanded him and he had to do it. When she heard that her husband wanted to bless the older son, she immediately said, \"That the blessing must come upon my younger son\" and she said, \"You must obey what I command you to do.\" May God raise mothers again who have authority and say you must do what I command you to do. Mothers, is that your life? That you command your children and they do it?",
