As believers, we need to have our eyes opened to see this Jacob in our flesh that God may deliver us.",

Our life is to be an extension of the love and mercy of God and to give of ourselves unselfishly. When we choose to go this way with God we will be lead on a journey into hard places. In these hard places God will visit us. We will find wisdom and compassion for every dreadful place God allows us to go through. Heaven will open to the person who is willing to be poured out for the good and betterment of others.",

Jacob lied, and stole from his brother, but he had a contrite heart. Even though throughout his life he endured many trials, God was with him, all the way. Throughout the 14 years he spent working to marry Rachel, conflict with his fatherinlaw, conflict between his two wives, fear of his brother, his daugther being attacked, and his sons committing murder, to the disappearance of Joseph, and the famine in the land that arose later, God kept Jacob, and his family, and they were never in any real danger. In the end, Jacob's testimony was, \"at 130 years old, few and evil have the days of the years of my life been. \" (Gen. 47:9).  Many are the afflictions of the righteous, but the Lord delivereth him out of them all. Ps. 34:19",
