            "description": "The douri that Jacob gave for Rachel was the 7 years of labor for Laban. The 7 years only seemed like a few days to Jacob because he loved Rachel so much. In this deception of Jacob with the 2 wife\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s so we can see the deception that he showed to his father Isaac. Daniel= God is judge. Dan was the name of Jacob\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s child because he said that God had judged me. Mandrakes thought to have properties to help childbirth, they were called love apples. Men were esteemed much higher then men, if a child was born who was a girl then it was not as a big deal as if it was a boy. Most of Jacob\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s daughters are not named except for Dima. Jacob separates the flocks using his knowledge of raising animals so that his stripped and spotted would reproduce better. The Hebrew word conceive actually means to be made hot. By placing stripes before the animals made them want to conceive. Jacob noticed the countance of Laban that he was not pleased with Jacob. Then Jacob hears from the Lord to tell him to go back to the land of his fathers. Jacob calls his wife to go out to the field from the tent for him to tell them about this so they are not over heard. Jacob left with all he had without telling Laban and went off to mount Gilad, which is about 300 miles away. The best he could do with that type of large size of flocks is 15 miles a day. In reality Laban would never had let Jacob go, he would have taken everything he had. But God spoke to Laban the night before telling him not to harm Jacob.",
