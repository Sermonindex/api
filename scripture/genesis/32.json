            "description": "God has angels to take care and protect over us. Chuck smith recalls of some times when he believes and angel saved him from harm, he was consciously aware of the working of an angel. Jacob prays and reminds the Lord of what he said, there is something that is good to remind the Lord of his promises. When Jacob fled from his brother Esau he left just with the walking stick in his hand, but now when he has returned he had many flocks. In the present he gave to Esau was 500 animals which was just part of what he had. An honest negative confession is worse then a positive dis-honest confession. It is best to be honest when you talk with God, who are you kidding; He knows your heart and everything about you. There is no hiding of anything to God; everything is open and naked before him. Faith is not passive but active. But God wants us to trust in His ability to do His work. Jacob wrestles with an angel and would not give up and surrender, so when the angel saw he would not surrender he crippled Jacob. One of Jacob\u2019s thoughts was that he could always flee; now the Lord through this crippling has taken away this way of his escape in the flesh. This is an good illustration of what God has to do sometimes to get a person to a place of dependence on the Lord.",

In his own emittable segway, right after the previous quote, he states, \"i know you didn't say amen, but it's still there\". This message is about how God strips every man he chooses to use as his chosen instrument everything that the person relies upon themselves to carry them in their daily life. In this case, Jacob relied on his physical strength, not to mention he also was a cheater.",

            "description": "An in-depth look at the life of Jacob reveals that even when you sin, but want to be right, and sorry for your sin, God will look on you with mercy. Jacob lied, and stole from his brother, but he had a contrite heart. Even though throughout his life he endured many trials, God was with him, all the way. Throughout the 14 years he spent working to marry Rachel, conflict with his fatherinlaw, conflict between his two wives, fear of his brother, his daugther being attacked, and his sons committing murder, to the disappearance of Joseph, and the famine in the land that arose later, God kept Jacob, and his family, and they were never in any real danger. In the end, Jacob's testimony was, \"at 130 years old, few and evil have the days of the years of my life been. \" (Gen. 47:9).  Many are the afflictions of the righteous, but the Lord delivereth him out of them all. Ps. 34:19",

Our flesh doesn't like these kind of messages, but there is tremendous spiritual growth possible to the one who submits to God's chastening.",
