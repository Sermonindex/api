            "description": "Jacob's detour to Shechem shows us how important it is to be wholehearted and radical and how this transformation process can be.  In Shechem, Jacob ran into many problems, losing authority in the home and his daughters wandering the streets.  Esau's having kings long before Jacob's teaches that affliction is the true preparation for kingship.  Joseph serves as a challenge to have a heart open to God and also as a tremendous picture of Jesus Christ.",

God called brother Zac Poonen to a new work early on in his Christian experience. The movement is now called Christian Fellowship Churches where the New Covenant of New Testament Christianity is clearly preached. \r\n\r\nBrother Zac Poonen has written 25 books most of them being on the deeper Christian life. Many of these have been translated into a number of languages and have been circulated widely around the world. He clearly and passionately shares the  narrow way of Christian discipleship that is neglected by so many modern preachers.",
