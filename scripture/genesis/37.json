            "description": "The Coat of many colors came from the translation from Martin Luther; the more accurate interpretation would be sleeveless coats. It was the intention of Jacob to make Joseph a ruler and Gods dreams confirmed this to have him rule over his brothers and even his mother and father. The brothers were jealous of their younger brother. This story helps us understand the book of revelation chapter 12. There is a women who has stars over her head which is Israel not the Church. The best commentary you can ever buy on the bible is the bible its self. To interpret the women as the church strains what the church really is. Never does scripture state the church is like a pregnant women. But always as a chaste virgin so right there we already have problems to fit it into the chapter 12 scenarios. When they want to kill Joseph they still mention the dreams which they highly resented. Reuben was the older brother who was responsible for the younger boy. He told them to just throw him into the pit but he would want to save him after. They stripped him of his coat, as they stripped Jesus of the garment he had. Joseph being an ruler in Egypt speaks of Jesus being resurrected and risen with authority at the right hand of God.",

Joseph's call was mighty and so is ours. We need to die to self, and let the crucified One who lives in us live through us.\u00c2\u00a0 He will give us power to die to the things he's asking us to. Our willingess to follow him in this, to follow our Master and lay down our life for his purposes is a life lived sacrificially. The pit creates a longing to shed the selfish and proud life in us and want more of God. This is a message about taking up our cross.",

Founder of the Free Presbyterian Movement with over 100 churches world-wide and bible colleges. This presbyterian renewal movement was started in light of compromise and apostasy in existing churches in Ireland, Scotland and England. These churches are clear biblical churches with a clear emphasis on preaching the Gospel of Jesus Christ and His death for sinners.\r\nIan Paisley also has been active in politics for many years and a leader of a political party. Leonard Ravenhill commented once that the Lord could have used paisley in a powerful way like Whitfield if he stayed away from politics. His preaching is expositional and biblical from a burdened heart to represent His Lord well.",
