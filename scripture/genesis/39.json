We have joy and peace in our problems because they are for our good and God can sustain and keep us during those times. Joseph\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s life typified an life of trials and tribulations but at the same time he has an inward victory knowing that God would bless him and make him prosperous over his family and lead him. Potifers wife daily was tempting Joseph to go to bed with her. Understand who he was kept him from sub coming to the temptation. It was possibly something normal to do in Egypt (world) but even though its normal for the world its our calling as a Christian to be different and follow God because of who we are in Christ. How can we who are dead in sin live any longer, Joseph says this to himself how can he do this evil deed before God with a good conscience. You need to have the reconigition of Gods presence with you all the time, we cannot sin against God willfully knowing He knows all things.",

            "description": "Every Christian should have made a covenant with his eyes not even to look upon temptation. Some temptations only need a spark before it brings forth sin. Remember Job who made a covenant with his eyes not even to look upon a young girl, a virgin (Job 31:1). Why would you live among sinners and those who are corrupt in word and deed. A person is known by his friends. Look at who your friends are, then you know who you are. In Ps 1 we read that \"blessed is the man who walk not after the counsel of the ungodly, nor stand in the way of sinners, nor sit in the seat of the scornful\".",
