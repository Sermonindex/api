Someone had the interpretation that Even knew the serpent and that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s how the seed of Cain was formed but that is clearly conjecture and not scriptural fact. In the Old Mosaic law the offering of grain was a plausible offering to be given to God. It was the lack of faith in Cain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s offering. Sometimes the best commentary of the Old Testament is the New Testament. For example in Hebrews 11 it tells us about the situation of Cain and Abel. Just because God questions in genesis doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t mean that God doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know but rather he is trying to get Cain to confess. God knows exactly what I happening all the time but God is merciful to try and get us to confess our sins before Him. We always try to justify ourselves rather then just saying, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I am wrong\u00e2\u20ac\u009d. There was much more a purer strain of humans in the beginning therefore marrying a sister would not cause such genetic defects as it would today. Methuselah almost lived for an entire millennium. Noah\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s father still lived at the same time that Adam was living. Methuselah died in the year of the flood. Enoch broke the chain, he was a man of faith because he walked with God. He has the testimony in Hebrews that Enoch pleased God. The father says of His son, this is my beloved Son who I am well pleased with. We please God in our trusting Him. There are other records of the flood in Egypt and Babylon etc. Some of them are gross accounts of this biblical truth. But this truth shows that man has a common creation and start.",

            "description": "His clear cut call to really understanding the true nature of Christian life is that it must be lived in prayer. He shows from the beginning of the bible to the end God has gathered apart a people to Himself that would 'call upon His name'. Be challanged, convicted and changed as you listen to this message, it has been a turning point for my life and many others also that I personally know. I believe this message was preached at Jack Hayford's church. The quality isn't the best and the second half of the sermon is missing but its worth the listen.",

Instead, we have turned away from listening to God and His word into paths of unrighteousness. One of the most aggravated sins of moral degeneracy of our nation is that of the unrequited blood of murdered multitudes. Our nation is stained with an ocean of blood that cries to God for His vengeance. In this opening up of God's Word to our nation, we hear God's rebuke and denunciation for our nation's aggravated sins and a call to repentance and prayer.",

There is a great danger of having the gifts of God without the heart of God. God is calling us to a militant love that declares, \"I AM my brother's keeper\".",
