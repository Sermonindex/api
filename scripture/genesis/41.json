In the times of great abundance, Pharaoh\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s dream instructs us to be wise to store up, whether physically or spiritually with our free time to study God's Word.  The naming of Joseph's two sons illustrates that before we can be fruitful, we must forget all the evil and mistakes of others.",

God called brother Zac Poonen to a new work early on in his Christian experience.

Many of these have been translated into a number of languages and have been circulated widely around the world. He clearly and passionately shares the  narrow way of Christian discipleship that is neglected by so many modern preachers.",
