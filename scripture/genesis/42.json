            "description": "Pharaoh had 2 dreams and was brought before the Pharaoh. Joseph interprets the dreams not of his own ability but out of the power and ability of God. Pharaoh was surprised with the way Joseph was able to interpret the dream so he made him 2nd in charge of all of Egypt. Joseph measured and kept the wheat in special places in Egypt. After 7 years of gathering food then the 7 years of famine began. It was not a local famine but rather a large spread famine that affected many areas outside of Egypt. The brothers were commanded by their father to go down to Egypt to get food. They seemed reluctant to go peradventure they run across their brother who they sold into Egypt slave hood, so possibly they had some bad feelings still for doing this. Benjamin replaced his younger brother Joseph so Israel gave more affection to him, so he had that favored position that once was hold by Joseph. So when the brothers went to Egypt Benjamin was kept home for that reason, lest mischief befall on him.  It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s amazing to see Joseph in a place over his brothers again that they were bowing down to him. What a amazing faith Jospeh had to believe it before it came to pass those 21 years ago.",

AN immense number of persons came down into Egypt from all parts of the world to buy corn. Many of these Joseph never saw. Many others came into his personal presence. I do not find that of all who came, he treated any of them roughly, except his own brethren. 'Strange!' you will say, and if you did not know the sequel of the story, it would not only seem strange, but cruel. You would not. know how to account for such a thing. Very like this is the manner of God's providence. There are thousands of people living in this world, with all if whom God deals according to wisdom. We all bear trouble in a measure, for 'Man is born unto trouble, as the sparks fly upwards.' .Some have more troubles than others, and these often happen to be those who are dearest to the Lord. If any man escape the rod, the true-born children of the royal family of heaven never can. Some may sin and prosper, but the righteous, if they sin, suffer. The ungodly are permitted to fatten like sheep for the slaughter, to have no bands even in their death; their strength is firm; they are not in trouble, as other men, neither are they plagued like other men...",
