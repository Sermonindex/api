The blessings and warnings to Jacob's sons can be equally appropriate to us.  Reuben warns us that if we cannot rule over our own passions we cannot lead in the church.  \"Am I in God's place?\" is a good question to ask ourselves if we are secretly delighting in \u00e2\u20ac\u0153being God\u00e2\u20ac\u009d to other brothers and sisters.",

God called brother Zac Poonen to a new work early on in his Christian experience. The movement is now called Christian Fellowship Churches where the New Covenant of New Testament Christianity is clearly preached. \r\n\r\nBrother Zac Poonen has written 25 books most of them being on the deeper Christian life. Many of these have been translated into a number of languages and have been circulated widely around the world. He clearly and passionately shares the  narrow way of Christian discipleship that is neglected by so many modern preachers.",
