He was born in Newtownards, County Down, Ireland in 1911. In his book Tramp after God, he tells of living for more than three years as a tramp abusing alcohol and involved in crime. Willie Mullan had a religious conversion and from that time forward he decided he would strive to serve God.\r\n\r\n In 1953 Willie Mullan was called to Lurgan Baptist church, and in August of that year he commenced the work in Lurgan. One of his great accomplishments during this time was the Tuesday night Bible class. Every Tuesday night hundreds attended to hear the exposition of the Word. In 1957 William Hewitt and a team of helpers commenced the tape recordings of the Bible class. At least 1500 of these recordings remain until this day.",

            "description": "It is an amazing fact to realize that the Noah\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ark can be readily proven via scientific fact and findings. People have found traces of the wood from Noah\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ark on mount Arafat and the countries surrounding the findings are closed to scientific research of this nature for it will shed light on the true ownership of the Land of Israel. There are many theories surrounding all the facets of the true story of Noah and the great flood that occurred. One states that the valley where Noah lived was  flooded but if that was the fact then God could have simply told him to go over to an mountain ridge nearby or over to another valley. Also Many findings of the different coruscations of the earth and layers that occur over time show what was found on each layer, but interestingly there are trees and other objects that go through many of the layers of even so called \u00e2\u20ac\u0153millions\u00e2\u20ac\u009d of years. These inconsistencies really speak against what some scientists call fact. Chuck believes that the Noah story is not a good story to use for the proof of the rapture because God is more merciful then just saving that few. And that is a better picture of those who will be saved through the tribulation ie 140,000. And Enoch is a more better picture of the rapture of the church in Chuck\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s eyes.",
