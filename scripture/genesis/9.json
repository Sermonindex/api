Brother Zac shows the safety of pressures and persecutions such as Noah faced for 120 years; his fall came in the time of ease.

Instead, we have turned away from listening to God and His word into paths of unrighteousness. One of the most aggravated sins of moral degeneracy of our nation is that of the unrequited blood of murdered multitudes. Our nation is stained with an ocean of blood that cries to God for His vengeance.
