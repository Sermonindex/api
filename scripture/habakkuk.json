I will never give up on the mercy of God, but I will tell you this: He will not always strive with man and there is a judgment coming to the house of God. Jesus Christ is the Head of the Church and He must have the preeminence in all. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s His Church, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s His body, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s His Bride\u00e2\u20ac\u201dand I tell you, that any Assembly where Jesus Christ is not truly the Head is sliding rapidly to the judgment of God. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s where we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve got to make the vision plain; we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve got to make it personal: do I honor Him as the Head of the house? It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not enough for us to memorize Scripture that says that Jesus Christ is the Head of the Church.",

He also gives the solution of the great truth of the true baptism of the Holy Spirit for to reach the lost world and make disciples.  This message is needful to be heard by the whole Church in this hour.",

It is an immensely practical teaching encouraging self-examination and personal restoration to broadening one's prayer life for others.  He tackles theological debates on how revival comes, \"Is it just a soverign work of God?\" or \"Is it the right use of appropriate means?\"  Guzik cited a number of fascinating examples from J. Edwin Orr's book about the Second Great Awakening in Britain.",
