I will never give up on the mercy of God, but I will tell you this: He will not always strive with man and there is a judgment coming to the house of God. Jesus Christ is the Head of the Church and He must have the preeminence in all. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s His Church, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s His body, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s His Bride\u00e2\u20ac\u201dand I tell you, that any Assembly where Jesus Christ is not truly the Head is sliding rapidly to the judgment of God. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s where we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve got to make the vision plain; we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve got to make it personal: do I honor Him as the Head of the house? It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not enough for us to memorize Scripture that says that Jesus Christ is the Head of the Church.",

This message given by David Legge in that historic pulpit calls for a glorious new work of the Spirit of God in our day. Such a work will glorify the Lord Jesus Christ as the true Head of the Church and Lord of all creation. May we be challenged afresh to accept and look forward to God\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s work in these last days.",

He has raised up many pastors who are a part of the Calvary Chapel movement now and where he pastors the large Costa Mesa church in California.\r\n\r\nThe Calvary Chapel movement is based of simple principles that Chuck Smith taught over the years such as: The priority of agape love, Simple fellowship amongst the saints, the breaking of bread, the teaching of God's word chapter by chapter and verse by verse.
