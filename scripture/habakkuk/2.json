I will never give up on the mercy of God, but I will tell you this: He will not always strive with man and there is a judgment coming to the house of God. Jesus Christ is the Head of the Church and He must have the preeminence in all. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s His Church, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s His body, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s His Bride\u00e2\u20ac\u201dand I tell you, that any Assembly where Jesus Christ is not truly the Head is sliding rapidly to the judgment of God. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s where we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve got to make the vision plain; we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve got to make it personal: do I honor Him as the Head of the house? It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not enough for us to memorize Scripture that says that Jesus Christ is the Head of the Church.",

He clearly shows biblically that if we are of the kingdom of Christ the kingdom of this world will be in opposition against us. We need to prepare for this and prepare to love our enemies and share the Gospel.",

He was radically converted by reading the New Testament. God used him to have a powerful prophetic insight into the end-times and the coming suffering of the jewish people before the great accepting of Jesus as Messiah. His eschatological insight is a very needful truth to be realized in the body of Christ. \r\n\r\nArt was a prophetic voice insofar as he called his listeners to purposes in God that would affect both time and eternity, purposes that had to do with the glory of God in the Church.   Frequently, his messages called the Church to an awareness of the Last Days [End-times] in such a way that made that time seem imminent and at the door.",
