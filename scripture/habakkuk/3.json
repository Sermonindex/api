            "description": "Guzik illustrates how conversion of sinners follows transformation of life, which follows conviction of sin as the Spirit is poured out on the Church.  It is an immensely practical teaching encouraging self-examination and personal restoration to broadening one's prayer life for others.  He tackles theological debates on how revival comes, \"Is it just a soverign work of God?\" or \"Is it the right use of appropriate means?\"  Guzik cited a number of fascinating examples from J. Edwin Orr's book about the Second Great Awakening in Britain.",

A revivalist and man of God who sought God's will above all else. He was a man of prayer who practiced what he preached.

Yet he stayed true to God's call on his life prayed and pleading for true heaven sent revival. \r\n\r\n\"Those who know of Leonard Ravenhill recognize in him the religious specialist, the man sent from God to battle the priests of Baal on their own mountain top, to shame the careless priest at the altar, to face the false prophet, and to warn the people who are being led astray by him. \" - Tozer | \"Leonard Ravenhill was one of the few men I have ever known who was a true prophet.\" - David Wilkerson",
