It is important because everything a person does today -- no matter how slight -- will have consequences tomorrow. God emphasizes this in Haggi 1:5, 7. Pastor Tozer points out that the Pharisees were classic examples of knowing everyone else's ways but their own. They, who should have known better, ignored God's command to examine themselves, so they remained ignorant of their own actions and were spiritually stagnant.",
