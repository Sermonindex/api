Are you offended by Christ? We pray and doubt that God can hear us, or answer our prayers. so we have unfulfilled expectations. God responds to us, \"You are offended by the way I am bringing about my kingdom\" You have need of patience after you have done the will of the father to receive the promise. David Wilkerson says, \"I am so glad that God didn't answer my prayers in the way that I asked him! I would not be here!\"  One thing that John did well, was to take his doubts to Jesus.  Jesus reaffirmed him of who he was and pressed him further, \"...blessed is he who is not offended because of me\"",

By faith Moses chose the affliction of the people of God, forsaking the pleasures of sin and the riches of Egypt, because he trusted the Lord to make him a partaker of the riches of Christ. Faith \"reckons, risks and rests\" - and secures God's promises, sometimes by doing what is foolish in the eyes of the world. Such obedience can only arise from confidence in God to keep his promises, regardless of appearances.",

The quality of life described in the new covenant is distinctively better than that of the old covenant, as high as Jesus is above Moses.  Living in the superior provision of the new covenant is having a Father as Jesus did, not a policeman full of rules and regulations.",

The root causes of failure to walk by faith are in seeing faith as something in ourselves or working hard to obtain what only God can do.  Zac shares how he tried every doctrine of holiness and failed miserably until he came to see the simplicity of biblical faith--leaning of the human personality in total confidence in God's perfect love for me.",

This was a surprise and great blessing for before we were never aware of this underground house Church name. After reading their statement of faith, there was an immediate burden to make this statement of faith available to Gospel Fellowships and to any other house Churches or groups that would like to identify with the statement. We believe it is a tremendous way for believers to be in unity worldwide with precious brothers and sisters in China who are experiencing a great expansion of the Church and revival.",

It is easy to become offended at God when He moves in ways that we do not expect -- especially if He does not seem to be moving at all! But, our heart's cry should be to know Him.  If this is the case, we will never be offended, no matter how \"forgotten\" we feel. Even our master Jesus exclaimed many times through the gospels 'blessed is he who is not offended in me'.",

God offers a personal relationship to all who desire Him with a sincere heart. When you come with a sincere heart the first thing you will see is His mercy. As you behold the mercy of God and the promises of God you will be changed into a new person. God longs to give you something deeper than a casual relationship. He longs to give you something deeper than just knowing some facts about Him. Have the courage to go deeper and come home to God today!",

He offers a balanced view on how to determine what soulishness is, and says that we must learn to allow the sword of the spirit to divide that which is of the soul from that which is of the Spirit, in order that we may fly out of this snare.",

Who of us haven\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t fallen into sin after being a Christian? One thinks of Esau who sought repentance with tears but could not find it. We need to carefully examine this scripture. We should never take God lightly. A person so easily falls into sexual immorality, or some other sin. And then that person confesses the sin but go back to it a few days later. Such a person is poking his finger in God\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s eyes and his future is not good. What is man that you should be fearful of him? Rather fear God Who can put both soul and body in hell (Matt 10:28).",

SPURGEON, AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON. \u201cOut of weakness were made strong.\u201d-Hebrews 11:34. SOME kinds of weakness are of God's appointment, and necessarily incident to manhood; they are not sinful, and, therefore, we may continue to be subject to them without regret. In reference to such weaknesses it may be that after beseeching the Lord even thrice to remove them, it may be for our good that they should remain. Then will our gracious God give us, in place of removing the weakness, this reply, \u201cMy grace shall be sufficient for thee.\u201d This is a case of in weakness made strong, and there are many of God's saints who daily experience so blessed a privilege. They are weak, and continue weak; they have infirmities which they once wished to have removed, but which now they are content to bear; for now they are of the same mind with the apostle, that they glory in their infirmity, because when they are weak they are strong. But, dear friends, there is another kind of weakness which is sinful, a weakness which springs not from nature but from fallen nature; not from God's appointment, but from our sinfulness, and out of this we should desire to be delivered. We cannot pray for strength in sinful weakness, but must earnestly plead for strength to come out of it and to be made strong.",

            "description": "Wonderful message by Paul Washer about true fellowship within the body of Christ. Going to church on Sunday's and maybe on Wednesday's doesn't mean you are in church or evening having fellowship. It is silly to say that we are going to church...when we are the church. What kind of fellowship can you have in church? Usually we are sitting in pews for an hour, shake some hands in between breaks and then when it is over you go home or maybe even out to lunch!?",

From Hebrews 12:23-27 he goes to a number of scriptures on how God has spoken and conversed with his prophets and saints throughout the whole Bible.

He shows clearly why it is such a necessary and vital part of the Christian life, and what the effects and benefits of it are. In so doing, arguing always from the basis of scripture, he exposes the dangers of \u2018Hyper-Calvinism\u2019 (ie, \u2018extreme\u2019 views of the doctrines of election and predestination), which lead some to believe that things such as exhortation should not be necessary (65 minutes).",

If he can convince you God is mad at you or doesn't care about your situation, he has already won half the battle. Faithfulness to God can only come out of a trusting, believing heart. the devil knows this and tries to hinder and discourage you with lies as you begin seeking to enter into the rest of the Lord, and spiritual blessings he has for his children.",

The Holy Spirit in this chapter selects out of good men's lives the most brilliant instances of their faith. I should hardly have expected that he would have mentioned the dying scene of Joseph's life as the most illustrious proof of his faith in God. That eventful life perhaps the most interesting in all sacred Scripture, with the exception of one, abounds with incidents, of which the Holy Spirit might have said by his servant Paul, \u201cBy faith Joseph did this and that,\u201d but none is mentioned save the closing scene. The triumph especially of his chastity under well-known and exceedingly severe temptation, might have been very properly traced to the power of his faith, but it is passed over, and the fact that he gave commandment concerning his bones is singled out as being the most illustrious proof of his faith. Does not this tell us, dear brethren and sisters, that we are very poor judges of what God will most delight in? Very likely when we least please ourselves God is best pleased with us. That prayer over which we groaned, and thought it was not prayer, may have had more true supplication in it than...",

SPURGEON AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON. \u201cLet us go forth therefore unto him without the camp, bearing his reproach.\u201d- Hebrews 13:13. MODERN professors have discovered a very easy way of religion. There is a method by which a man may attain to great reputation as a Christian, and yet avoid all the trials of the believer's estate. He may go through the world finding his path as smoothly turfed as the flesh could desire. Blessed with the smiles of friendly formalists, and with the admiration of the ungodly, he may pass from his first entrance into the Church to his grave without experiencing so much as a single shower to damp his delight; but, on the contrary, the sun may smile sweetly upon him all the way, the birds may sing, not a raven may dare to croak, not a single owl may hoot; his road to glory and immortality shall be all that ease could wish.

We are to look away from self and consider the need and suffering of those around us reaching out to them with the love of Jesus. Jesus said \u201cif you love me feed my sheep\u201d!!",

Pastor Hession shows there are 3 key sayings in these verses, 1: Where is the Lamb? when we are stubborn and self willed where are the lamb like qualities in us that marked the life of our Lord?  2: God will provide Himself a Lamb,  this He did in the form of his Son, the Lord Jesus, Who was the only One Who could offer up a sweet smelling savour to God.  3: He shall be accepted for Him, here is the wonder of His substitution for us that God credits to us the sweet savour that ascended up from Calvary.",

God is always moving forward but He is having to bring His people back from where they have deviated from His intention and plan. Man never really learns anything theoretically. Man really learns anything only by experience. Everything in Christianity depends on the meaning of Jesus Christ. The main thing is a revelation of a Person inwardly. God reveals His Son \"in us\".",

            "description": "(Erlo Stegen shares in the Zulu language with English translation.) Scientists say that when you look at pornography there are chemicals that are automatically released in the brain which changes the brain in such a way that it alters it's structure. Porn rewires you. Adam and Eve didn't know they were naked, but when they sinned they became aware of it and were ashamed. God Himself then slaughtered an animal and clothed them with the skins. This was a pointer towards the time when Jesus would be slaughtered for our sins on the Cross. The Bible says marriage should be honoured by all and the marriage bed undefiled, for God will judge the adulterers (Hebrews 13:4). Pornography is an evil drug, worse than dagga (marijuana) and many other drugs. Looking at pornography makes you a slave to it. It's easier to stop smoking or drinking than to get free from pornography.",

SPURGEON, AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON, \u201cNow the God of peace, that brought again from the dead our Lord Jesus, that great Shepherd of the sheep, through the blood of the everlasting covenant, make you perfect in every good work to do his will, working in you that which is well pleasing in his sight, through Jesus Christ; to whom be glory for ever and ever. Amen.\u201d- Hebrews 13:20, 21.  THE apostle, in the eighteenth verse, had been earnestly asking for the prayers of the Lord's people. On the behalf of all his brethren he said, \u201cPray for us;\u201d and for himself he added, \u201cI beseech you the rather to do this, that I may be restored to you the sooner.\u201d If the apostle needed the prayers of his brethren, how much more do we who are so greatly inferior to him in all respects. We may, indeed, even with tears appeal to you who are our brethren in Christ, and entreat you to be earnest in your supplications to God on our behalf. What can we do without your prayers? They link us with the omnipotence of God. Like the lightning-rod, they pierce the clouds and bring down the mighty and mysterious power from on high. But what the apostle was anxious to receive he was careful to bestow, and therefore he proceeded in the words of our text to plead for his brethren; from which we learn that if we desire others to pray for us we must set the example of praying for them...",

Those who have been in the heavenly places with Christ, and are overcoming believers. They are overcoming the flesh, the devil, and the world. They walk in the power of the Spirit and their heart is not here but in heaven with Jesus, and their mind is on heavenly things. God has a controversy when the nations of this world mistreat His Son's Body. Sinners and hypocrites in Zion will be afraid when God begins to move and shake things. They won't be prepared for there is no security unless you are IN CHRIST. Unless your life is hid in Him, and you are dead to this world and it's vain attractions. The enemy is coming in like a flood against God's people, but remember, He sits, as KING of the flood.",

When the man  is found by the neighboring citizens, clothed and sitting at the feet of Jesus in his right mind, instead of rejoicing at his deliverance, they reject Jesus, and ask him to leave for they are unwilling to follow him if it means losing their pigs. Many are unwilling to trust their life to Jesus, and are holding back part of themselves, unwilling to surrender, having counted the cost and the price too high. If you are happy with average, this message isn't for you. If you are determined to follow Jesus, wholly,  listen with an open heart.",

For example when you're cut, your body immediately reacts and sends the white blood cells to fight the infection. The dead white blood cells are then expelled as puss. In the same way the Blood of Christ cleanses us from all unrighteousness to counter any poison of sin that enters. The blood is like petrol that allows your body to function. The other members of the body remains in its place, but the blood is present right through your body. The blood also carries oxygen throughout your body. It also gets rid of impurities and acts like a refuse remover. We speak so glibly about the Blood of Christ, little realising what it does. It brings us life and that's why the devil hates it.",

This is the reason why there is such a powerless testimony and the church is becoming a non issue in this society. We cannot be devoted to the Lord and be devoted to the things that offend His holy name. God is calling His church to come outside the camp and come out of mixture and compromise to serve the Lord wholeheartedly. In every generation there has to be somebody that is willing to stand in the middle of the marketplace and bear the reproach of Jesus Christ.",

The problem is not so much error of doctrine as error of emphasis. A Fundamentalist himself, the pastor touches on the history of Fundamentalists and the trouble with increasingly detailed eschatology that has coincided with their emergence over the past 100 years. In spite of many Evangelicals\u2019 dogmatic preoccupation with how to view the millennium, something has not changed and must never be forgotten: Jesus is coming back. Take heed. Beware. Watch. Worship the Christ who is returning in time, and not the details of that time itself. The recording runs for 41 minutes, 21 seconds.",

Secondly, we can know Him personally as our Father, in living connection with Him all the day, both speaking and listening.  And finally, God writes upon the two tablets--the mind and the heart--to not only be willing but the grace as God's power to do it.",

            "description": "This message is about the need to not depend on circumstances in our lives staying the same and putting our future in the hands of God. Carter points out that a Christians life of self denial involves continuous change and that it is important not to rely on past or present people, places, or things. We go from glory to glory and there is a constant need for change. When Christians refuse to change, they stay in secure places and do things even in worship that that are the way they have always done them. Churches that that once had fire can become dead by not changing. Carter went to Rev 2 with the church of Ephesus as an example of a church without change leaving it's first love for familiarity. Carter used the example of Peter getting out of the boat to walk on water of a person who gets away from the security of familiar circumstances to follow the Lord's bidding. Hebrews 13;14 Was quoted early by Carter, \"We have no continuing city\".",

When we mix our prayers with faith, they will work.  To neglect prayer is to neglect God and the salvation he gave us. To not take advantage of the access given to us through the blood of Jesus is to take it lightly and do despite to the grace of God. Now more than ever the church needs to be praying.",

It will be revealed in eternity of how many times God warned us, gave us wake up calls, for what was coming, but we missed the warning signals. I believe our nation, and particularly the church is at this cross road now. God has sent alarming signs to us to show us the path we are on and what is coming. And unless a proper response is done by the church, we will go down in the history books as, 'having eyes to see, but could not see; having ears to hear, but could not hear'. Brethren I beseech you take notice of these words and let us respond now, while there is still time, before the 'night cometh when no man can work'.",
