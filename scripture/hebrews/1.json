He used Helen Keller\u2019s autobiographical comments of how understanding came to her all at once, to explain how spiritually blind and deaf mankind is being communicated to by God. He goes on to explain that God can use creation, experiences, our hearts, and above all, the Bible to speak to us. He ends this sermon with a strong affirmation of the reliability of the Bible. He quotes B. B. Warfield. \u201cThe Bible is the Word of God in such a sense, that whatever it says, God says.\u201d",

For in the Gospel of Matthew it is declared by our Lord: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Then you will be handed over to be persecuted and put to death, and you will be hated by all nations because of Me.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d14 This truth of persecution is Biblical and repeated often in the Scriptures.",

This was a surprise and great blessing for before we were never aware of this underground house Church name. After reading their statement of faith, there was an immediate burden to make this statement of faith available to Gospel Fellowships and to any other house Churches or groups that would like to identify with the statement. We believe it is a tremendous way for believers to be in unity worldwide with precious brothers and sisters in China who are experiencing a great expansion of the Church and revival.",

Soon after that I met Alan Redpath who invited me and my wife Jean to England, where we attended Capernwray Bible School. Upon returning to the United States, I continued my studies at Talbot Seminary in La Mirada, California.\r\nEarly in my ministry, I served for four years as an assistant pastor to Chuck Smith at Calvary Chapel of Costa Mesa, California.

During those years I founded Calvary Chapel Bible College in nearby Twin Peaks at the Calvary Chapel Conference Center (The college is now located in Murrieta Hot Springs). Sensing the Lord's direction to move on, we then pioneered and pastored another Calvary Chapel in Redlands, California, for eleven years. In 1991, we again, still having that pioneering heart, moved to San Jose with the heart to plant a number of churches in the Bay Area. There are now eight fellowships that have grown out of Calvary Chapel of San Jose. In September 2002, we responded to a request from Chuck Smith to return to Calvary Chapel of Costa Mesa to serve as an assistant.
