He used Helen Keller\u2019s autobiographical comments of how understanding came to her all at once, to explain how spiritually blind and deaf mankind is being communicated to by God. He goes on to explain that God can use creation, experiences, our hearts, and above all, the Bible to speak to us. He ends this sermon with a strong affirmation of the reliability of the Bible. He quotes B. B. Warfield. \u201cThe Bible is the Word of God in such a sense, that whatever it says, God says.\u201d",

This was a surprise and great blessing for before we were never aware of this underground house Church name. After reading their statement of faith, there was an immediate burden to make this statement of faith available to Gospel Fellowships and to any other house Churches or groups that would like to identify with the statement. We believe it is a tremendous way for believers to be in unity worldwide with precious brothers and sisters in China who are experiencing a great expansion of the Church and revival.",

It is very important for the people of God to know the meaning of the times in which we live. God is always moving forward but He is having to bring His people back from where they have deviated from His intention and plan. Man never really learns anything theoretically. Man really learns anything only by experience. Everything in Christianity depends on the meaning of Jesus Christ. The main thing is a revelation of a Person inwardly. God reveals His Son \"in us\".",
