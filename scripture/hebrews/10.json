If this is the case, we will never be offended, no matter how \"forgotten\" we feel. Even our master Jesus exclaimed many times through the gospels 'blessed is he who is not offended in me'.",

Going to church on Sunday's and maybe on Wednesday's doesn't mean you are in church or evening having fellowship. It is silly to say that we are going to church...when we are the church. What kind of fellowship can you have in church? Usually we are sitting in pews for an hour, shake some hands in between breaks and then when it is over you go home or maybe even out to lunch!?",

Jesus is met by a possessed man in the Gadarene tombs, who has many devils, and they with fear and trembling (James 2:19) beg Jesus to let them go into a nearby herd of pigs, rather than banish them to the pit, and he allows them to go. When the man  is found by the neighboring citizens, clothed and sitting at the feet of Jesus in his right mind, instead of rejoicing at his deliverance, they reject Jesus, and ask him to leave for they are unwilling to follow him if it means losing their pigs. Many are unwilling to trust their life to Jesus, and are holding back part of themselves, unwilling to surrender, having counted the cost and the price too high. If you are happy with average, this message isn't for you. If you are determined to follow Jesus, wholly,  listen with an open heart.",

When we mix our prayers with faith, they will work.  To neglect prayer is to neglect God and the salvation he gave us. To not take advantage of the access given to us through the blood of Jesus is to take it lightly and do despite to the grace of God. Now more than ever the church needs to be praying.",
