By faith Moses chose the affliction of the people of God, forsaking the pleasures of sin and the riches of Egypt, because he trusted the Lord to make him a partaker of the riches of Christ. Faith \"reckons, risks and rests\" - and secures God's promises, sometimes by doing what is foolish in the eyes of the world.

SPURGEON, AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON. \u201cOut of weakness were made strong.\u201d-Hebrews 11:34. SOME kinds of weakness are of God's appointment, and necessarily incident to manhood; they are not sinful, and, therefore, we may continue to be subject to them without regret. In reference to such weaknesses it may be that after beseeching the Lord even thrice to remove them, it may be for our good that they should remain. Then will our gracious God give us, in place of removing the weakness, this reply, \u201cMy grace shall be sufficient for thee.\u201d This is a case of in weakness made strong, and there are many of God's saints who daily experience so blessed a privilege. They are weak, and continue weak; they have infirmities which they once wished to have removed, but which now they are content to bear; for now they are of the same mind with the apostle, that they glory in their infirmity, because when they are weak they are strong. But, dear friends, there is another kind of weakness which is sinful, a weakness which springs not from nature but from fallen nature; not from God's appointment, but from our sinfulness, and out of this we should desire to be delivered. We cannot pray for strength in sinful weakness, but must earnestly plead for strength to come out of it and to be made strong.",

There are now eight fellowships that have grown out of Calvary Chapel of San Jose. In September 2002, we responded to a request from Chuck Smith to return to Calvary Chapel of Costa Mesa to serve as an assistant. And, in 2004 we took to the leadership of Calvary Chapel of Laguna Beach to help guide it through a difficult time.

I came to Christ at a Billy Graham Los Angeles Crusade in the 1960's. While completing my Bachelor of Science degree in Business Administration at Cal Poly Pomona, I sensed the call of God on my life to follow Jesus Christ completely and possibly forget business and prepare for the ministry.. Soon after that I met Alan Redpath who invited me and my wife Jean to England, where we attended Capernwray Bible School. Upon returning to the United States, I continued my studies at Talbot Seminary in La Mirada, California.\r\nEarly in my ministry, I served for four years as an assistant pastor to Chuck Smith at Calvary Chapel of Costa Mesa, California. Next Jean and I moved to Lake Arrowhead where we planted and pastored Calvary Chapel of Lake Arrowhead. During those years I founded Calvary Chapel Bible College in nearby Twin Peaks at the Calvary Chapel Conference Center (The college is now located in Murrieta Hot Springs). Sensing the Lord's direction to move on, we then pioneered and pastored another Calvary Chapel in Redlands, California, for eleven years. In 1991, we again, still having that pioneering heart, moved to San Jose with the heart to plant a number of churches in the Bay Area. There are now eight fellowships that have grown out of Calvary Chapel of San Jose. In September 2002, we responded to a request from Chuck Smith to return to Calvary Chapel of Costa Mesa to serve as an assistant. And, in 2004 we took to the leadership of Calvary Chapel of Laguna Beach to help guide it through a difficult time. That work being completed, we have now responded to a long time desire to step out and serve the churches and schools and missionaries that we love so much around the world.

I should hardly have expected that he would have mentioned the dying scene of Joseph's life as the most illustrious proof of his faith in God. That eventful life perhaps the most interesting in all sacred Scripture, with the exception of one, abounds with incidents, of which the Holy Spirit might have said by his servant Paul, \u201cBy faith Joseph did this and that,\u201d but none is mentioned save the closing scene. The triumph especially of his chastity under well-known and exceedingly severe temptation, might have been very properly traced to the power of his faith, but it is passed over, and the fact that he gave commandment concerning his bones is singled out as being the most illustrious proof of his faith. Does not this tell us, dear brethren and sisters, that we are very poor judges of what God will most delight in? Very likely when we least please ourselves God is best pleased with us.

Isaac was to be the burnt offering which would produce a sweet smelling savour to the Lord, we see him here in the place of the lamb that bows his head instead of stiffening his neck.  Pastor Hession shows there are 3 key sayings in these verses, 1: Where is the Lamb? when we are stubborn and self willed where are the lamb like qualities in us that marked the life of our Lord?  2: God will provide Himself a Lamb,  this He did in the form of his Son, the Lord Jesus, Who was the only One Who could offer up a sweet smelling savour to God.  3: He shall be accepted for Him, here is the wonder of His substitution for us that God credits to us the sweet savour that ascended up from Calvary.",

This missionary organization was founded in 1914 by C.T Studd, and was directed for many years by his son-in-law, Norman Grubb.\r\n\r\nIn 1947 Hession met leaders of the East African Church which was then experiencing a sweeping revival, and recognized his deep personal need. It was like starting the Christian life over as he came humbly to the Cross. The principles which the Lord taught him were first published in 1950 as The Calvary Road and are now available in over 70 languages! Hession's other titles include We Would See Jesus and Be Filled Now.",

In the same way the Blood of Christ cleanses us from all unrighteousness to counter any poison of sin that enters. The blood is like petrol that allows your body to function. The other members of the body remains in its place, but the blood is present right through your body. The blood also carries oxygen throughout your body. It also gets rid of impurities and acts like a refuse remover. We speak so glibly about the Blood of Christ, little realising what it does. It brings us life and that's why the devil hates it.",
