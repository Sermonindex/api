He carefully places Melchizedek as the icon of change from a Priesthood of antiquity, to a Priesthood of Eternal purpose. He clearly separates Levi from Melchizedek and authenicates the acquisition of Christ as our Great High Priest thus forever ending the Levitical priesthood.",

God offers a personal relationship to all who desire Him with a sincere heart. When you come with a sincere heart the first thing you will see is His mercy. As you behold the mercy of God and the promises of God you will be changed into a new person. God longs to give you something deeper than a casual relationship. He longs to give you something deeper than just knowing some facts about Him. Have the courage to go deeper and come home to God today!",
