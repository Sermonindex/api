The priest, whose charge it was to instruct the people in the ways of the ways of the Lord, had neglected their duty and no longer taught the people, for this God held them accountable.  The people of Israel had pushed God away so much that He would no longer warn them of their errors and He acctually departed from them in order to leave them their own devices. God's desire was that Israel would return to Him, and so Hosea wanted to lead the people in repentance towards the Lord for he knew that if the people would seek Him then He would be found of them.",

But the LOrd desired to draw Israel back to Himself with His love for them.  The Lord was like a parent to Israel who lovingly draws a child in their first uneasy steps.  Israel however did not want this and kept willfully backsliding away from God, they refused to repent of the sin they were now openly comitting before Him.  But despite this the Lord would not give up on them, He allowed them to go their own way but all the time was patient and longsuffering towards the nation.  This is a great illustration of the mercy and forgiveness of the Lord a thing we should be ever thankful for as He has also shown His great love for us in the death of His Son the Lord Jesus.",

Hosea likened the nation to an unturned pancake, burnt on one side towards the world and undone or unprepared toward the Lord, hence they were good for nothing neither hot nor cold like the church of Laodicea in Revelation 3.  By this time in their history Israel had become established in their sin and had set up their own ungodly rulers.  Even though they continued to sacrifice to the Lord the Lord no longer accepted the sacrifices as they were given from an unrepentant heart. The southern nation of Judah now tursted in their fortified cities but these cities could not save them from the judgement of God.  These prophecies were given at a time of great material prosperity in the nation of Israel when the people must have thought that the Lord was blessing them but didn't care that their hearts were foul towards Him.",

The Lord instructed Hosea to do a very difficult thing, to marry a woman who was a known prostitute, God commanded this because of Israels adultery against Him and He desired to work His word into the life of the prophet.  Hosea was the instructed by the Lord what to name each of his children the first was Jezreel (scattered), the second was Lo-ruhamah (no mercy) the third was Lo-ammi (not my people)  each of these childens names was reminder to all around them that the Lord would scatter the nation of Israel and would not show mercy to them as they no longer wanted to be His people. The Lord showed His love for the people in the life of Hosea in that when his adulterous wife was living with another man Hosea still povided for her, such is the Lord attitude of grace towards us in that even though we go astray He still mercifully provides for us.",

They had sent the Lord a message with their actions by showing they would only turn to Him when times where bad, so the Lord promised judgement so they would cry out to Him to save them once more.  The Lord makes great promises of deliverence to Israel even going so far as to say He will conquer death but if they would not turn to Him then they would go into exhile. The book of Hosea ends though not with judgement but with a great proclamation of the grace of God and that how if we would turn to Him with our whole hearts then He will shower us with His great mercies.",

How this must break the heart of God! The Lord doesn\u2019t judge with any delight in His heart but He looks down on what was supposed to be His heritage and says I can't let this go on any longer! He absolutely will not let His people pursue a path that will lead to hell. God is calling His church to return to Him and allow Him to take away all the iniquity in us that would keep His life from flowing through His Body. When we get right with God the storms will come but His church will stand with His Glory upon us. The testimony of the true church of Christ will not be shaken!",

Do you have recovery groups for the divorced and drug-dependent? Do you have yoga classes? Do you have Zumba dance classes? In other words, a typical American family looking for a typical American church today approaches it like they do a buffet line in a restaurant with a smorgasbord of choices. In essence, they are saying, \u201cBefore I join your church let me see a menu and look over it to see if you can service my family the way I want you to.\u201d",

They turned aside from God Who brought them out of Egypt with an outstretched hand and great power. Time after time they would repent, often half-heartedly, but then fall back worse than before. God refers here to \"the names of Baalim\" in their mouth - serving many Baals. You might serve many things, money, honour or pleasure. God says that He will make a covenant with them and the beasts of the field. What does He mean by this expression? There's a reference in the Bible that \"you may not muzzle the ox who treads the corn\", and it is applied in the New Testament to refer to those who sow the Gospel. So too these animals are a symbol of people.",

The 'core' sin of Israel was idolatry, but it was not their only sin far from it.  The Lord chose Hosea's marriage to illustrate how He felt toward Israel, His adulterous wife. the Lord commanded hosea to marry a woman of whoredom and shows Hosea before hand what she will be like toward him.  Each of their childen God then names, again as an illustration of how He felt toward Israel ie the children were the result of a relationship where the husband loved the wife but the wife went away to other men. The first was named Jezreel, which is a place in Israel where there has been great bloodshed and will one day be the location of the final war battle Armageddon. Hosea's other children children showed how the Lord for a time would judge Israel and not show mercy to them for they were no longer considered his people, hence they were called Lo-ruhammah (no mercy) and Lo-ammi (not My people).",

This is reflected in Hosea's adulterous wife Gomer and his faithfulness and love towards, the Lord had blessed Israel greatly and they had turned and praised idols for their blessings, so the Lord promises to send judgement on Israel in order to turn them back to Hi, and that is exactly where Israel are today mostly away from the Lord. Chapter 3 of Hosea has been described by some as the greatest chapter in the whole Bible quite a feat for 5 verses.  Gomer is up for auction as a slave and Hosea buys her back with all he has, he then takes her home and reclothes her.  This is exactly what the Lord has done for us, where we are obviously in the place of Gomer and Hosea in the place of the Lord.",

Chapter 5 deals with the punishment for their crimes Hosea prophesied the Israel would fall and later on Judah would fall too, this is exactly what happened even though Judah were given 100 years longer than Israel.  The Lord passed judgement on Israel.  The final verse in chapter 5 is of particular note as it refers to Christs first coming as it mentions the Lord going and the returning (to Heaven) and returning again until Israel acknowledges their sin of rejecting their Messiah and then He will return to them.",

Israel will realise that their years of affliction have been disciplinary in nature in order to bring them back into the loving arms of the Lord.  There will be a time of great tribulation for the nation of Israel that will culminate in the second advent of the Lord Jesus.  The rest of the chapter gets back into the teritory of God's charges against Israel, these include exploitation, injustice and the most abominable sexual sins, it is again more evidence of adulterous attitude of Israel toward the Lord, but also shows how we are toward Him aswell in running after our 'idols'.",

Israel in Hosea time, like our society today, believed that right and wrong were relative concepts thatcould be correct for one person but not necessarily for another, this is of course is utterly wrong God is absolute and He defines right and wrong.  Several of the kings of Israel were assasinated and hence surrounding the ruler there were many men with blood on their hands, Israel had put it's faith in the neighbouring nations and not in the Lord.  Because they had cast god away He would cast them away.  They had replaced the service of God with a dead religion and so thought they could atone for their own sins and because of this God would not even accept their sacrifices to Him.",

But now Israel was almost as abominable as in those days.  Verse 11 of chapter 9 is one of the many 'Pro-life' verses of the Bible stating plainly that life begins at conception. Hosea predicts that Israel would be scattered among the nations until the Lord regathered them into the land as only He could do this.  The Lord as always offered Israel one last chance to repent but they did not and so judgement came in the form of exhile into Assyria.",

The prophet began to discover that at the very heart of the almighty Creator was love and that God is love.  The Lord shows how His heart was torn for His people as He did not want to judge them but His holiness demanded it.  So judgement had to be prescribed upon the nation as they had commited idolatry in Bethel (the house of God) and this was a forshadowing of the abomination of desolation. We know that ultimately the Lord's love and justice met when His wrath was poured upon our Lord Jesus on the cross of Calvary.  How only His precious blood could atone for the wrong of not just Israel but for all of us.",

The Lord reminded Israel that He had brought them out of Egypt and out of bondage, and from this reminded them that He alone was their Saviour.  He shows them that He is their only Hope but they have stubbornly rejected Him and so their Saviour would be their Judge. Hosea beseeches the people to return to the Lord and repent. The Lord states that He will restore them to Him after they have repented, and the Lord would wonderfully take them back to Himself.  The prophecy of Hosea finishes with the ultimate repentence of Israel and turning back to the Lord and the Lord's acceptance of them which will herald the Second Coming.",

In the Bible it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s to be betrothed, \"a deed with a promise of marriage\". According to the law it is a contract between a man and a woman to get married in the future. The greatest engagement ever between two parties is between Jesus Christ and you. He says, \"I will betroth you to Me forever\". There cannot be engagement if the one party says yes and the other no \u00e2\u20ac\u201c both have to agree. God proposes to you, that He wants to be engaged to you. And this engagement is forever, it has no end. How can you say no to that proposal? In fact, if you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t agree to that engagement, it will be to your damnation in hell forever. And God says that He wants to get engaged to you now. Do you have the ring of Jesus on your finger?",
