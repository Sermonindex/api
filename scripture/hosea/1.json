The Lord instructed Hosea to do a very difficult thing, to marry a woman who was a known prostitute, God commanded this because of Israels adultery against Him and He desired to work His word into the life of the prophet.  Hosea was the instructed by the Lord what to name each of his children the first was Jezreel (scattered), the second was Lo-ruhamah (no mercy) the third was Lo-ammi (not my people)  each of these childens names was reminder to all around them that the Lord would scatter the nation of Israel and would not show mercy to them as they no longer wanted to be His people. The Lord showed His love for the people in the life of Hosea in that when his adulterous wife was living with another man Hosea still povided for her, such is the Lord attitude of grace towards us in that even though we go astray He still mercifully provides for us.",

The 'core' sin of Israel was idolatry, but it was not their only sin far from it.  The Lord chose Hosea's marriage to illustrate how He felt toward Israel, His adulterous wife. the Lord commanded hosea to marry a woman of whoredom and shows Hosea before hand what she will be like toward him.  Each of their childen God then names, again as an illustration of how He felt toward Israel ie the children were the result of a relationship where the husband loved the wife but the wife went away to other men. The first was named Jezreel, which is a place in Israel where there has been great bloodshed and will one day be the location of the final war battle Armageddon. Hosea's other children children showed how the Lord for a time would judge Israel and not show mercy to them for they were no longer considered his people, hence they were called Lo-ruhammah (no mercy) and Lo-ammi (not My people).",
