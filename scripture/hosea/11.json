            "description": "Here in Hosea we find the troubled heart of the Lord for His people Israel, the Lord's love for humanity is one of the greatest mysteries, it is shown in God's fatherly attributes toward us, yet these attributes are not common in the Old Testament and so this revelation must have been astonishing to Hosea at the time.  The prophet began to discover that at the very heart of the almighty Creator was love and that God is love.  The Lord shows how His heart was torn for His people as He did not want to judge them but His holiness demanded it.  So judgement had to be prescribed upon the nation as they had commited idolatry in Bethel (the house of God) and this was a forshadowing of the abomination of desolation. We know that ultimately the Lord's love and justice met when His wrath was poured upon our Lord Jesus on the cross of Calvary.  How only His precious blood could atone for the wrong of not just Israel but for all of us.",
