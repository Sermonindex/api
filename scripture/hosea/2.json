            "description": "This is a marvelous word! This is God Himself speaking to people who continually trouble Him. They've broken their covenant with God time and again. They turned aside from God Who brought them out of Egypt with an outstretched hand and great power. Time after time they would repent, often half-heartedly, but then fall back worse than before. God refers here to \"the names of Baalim\" in their mouth - serving many Baals. You might serve many things, money, honour or pleasure. God says that He will make a covenant with them and the beasts of the field. What does He mean by this expression? There's a reference in the Bible that \"you may not muzzle the ox who treads the corn\", and it is applied in the New Testament to refer to those who sow the Gospel. So too these animals are a symbol of people.",

This is reflected in Hosea's adulterous wife Gomer and his faithfulness and love towards, the Lord had blessed Israel greatly and they had turned and praised idols for their blessings, so the Lord promises to send judgement on Israel in order to turn them back to Hi, and that is exactly where Israel are today mostly away from the Lord. Chapter 3 of Hosea has been described by some as the greatest chapter in the whole Bible quite a feat for 5 verses.  Gomer is up for auction as a slave and Hosea buys her back with all he has, he then takes her home and reclothes her.  This is exactly what the Lord has done for us, where we are obviously in the place of Gomer and Hosea in the place of the Lord.",

In the Bible it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s to be betrothed, \"a deed with a promise of marriage\". According to the law it is a contract between a man and a woman to get married in the future. The greatest engagement ever between two parties is between Jesus Christ and you. He says, \"I will betroth you to Me forever\". There cannot be engagement if the one party says yes and the other no \u00e2\u20ac\u201c both have to agree. God proposes to you, that He wants to be engaged to you. And this engagement is forever, it has no end. How can you say no to that proposal? In fact, if you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t agree to that engagement, it will be to your damnation in hell forever. And God says that He wants to get engaged to you now. Do you have the ring of Jesus on your finger?",
