The message was preached in Chicago, Illinois, on January 24, 1954, and it addresses 1 Peter 2:1-3, as well as 1 Peter 1:23-25 (from Isaiah 40:6-7.) Pastor Tozer treats us to several very astute word studies: \u201cwherefore,\u201d \u201claying aside,\u201d \u201cguile,\u201d \u201chypocrisies,\u201d \u201cenvies,\u201d and \u201csincere milk.\u201d Without rebirth, the most promising child, the actress in Hollywood, the president in the White House, and the eugenicists\u2019 theoretical \u201csuper man,\u201d all exist beneath the same two, dark clouds: mortality and corruption. Men die and then they rot; thank God for the birth that is incorruptible and never dies! Drawing wisely from Socrates, Pastor Tozer also challenges those liberals who ask, instead of turning from wickedness, \u201cWhat is wickedness?\u201d The length of the recording is 39 minutes and 5 seconds.",

He takes use of many examples of people who try to get into heaven with money, with price. He explains how many people without God spend their days trying not to focus on Eternity, and trying to focus instead on the temporal. He charges the person thus without God to instead dare ponder his own soul's destination, that he will spend forever in Hell until he turns to the cross of Christ. Then he offers a firm and resolute \"entreat to believe on the Lord Jesus.\"",

Drawing amply from the scriptures, he paints a portrait of the revival spirit in its simplicity and pureness. He delivers with passion and brokenness as he accurately identifies the single reason why we do not see revival in our day. Listen, find out, be transformed.",

We don't know the journey God is taking us but he does. God will test and prove his people along this journey as he did Israel in the wilderness to see if we will believe and obey him. He wants us not living on bread (prosperity) promises alone, but by every promise in the Word of God. To not fully trust God is to strip him of all he wants to be and can be to us and bring him down to the level of a dead idol. It's a grievous sin in God's eyes to have unbelief, and the church needs to realize it.",

The reason we don't see God move is that we think that someone else besides us is blocking the moving of the Spirit. Included is a very interesting narrative about Dr. Ernest M. Wadsworth that documents his efforts for ministers to look inward to unblock the hindrance to revival, as well as many angry church members that called him during the week after being told to 'make your crooked places straight.' \"I went to the office of the mayor and was ushered into a private room. After I was seated, he said, 'I heard your sermon yesterday morning, now; man to man, I want to know who's been telling you about me?'\"",

Jackie gives a short, deep and challenging call to go and minister to the poor with a broken heart. Her message is followed by personal testimonies. The recording ends in weeping over the hardness of our hearts and for the poor. Real ministry is to show people the Lord of the Word: \"They will know what He is like by what you are like. So you live it with your life and they will read you like an epistle.\" Whenever the destitute cry out, God will respond by sending a person, and it could be you. God works through people. Jackie also points out that the poor don't need training in evangelism, as evangelism is simply \"one poor man telling another poor man where to find bread\".",

When the Lord has used His servant and His touch has come upon us there is a season of weeping and spiritual fatigue that will follow. It is in these seasons that satan himself will come with roaring accusations and attempt to lead us into a wilderness and a sense of powerlessness. It is complete fiction to believe the devil has any power to take you as a sincere believer from the security of your position through Christ in God. The devil can only come against us with roaring lies but in REALITY he has no power to do this. God Himself will come and whisper His mercy and love to show us we are not alone and evil will not triumph over us. He will vanquish our enemies with a still small voice and comfort and nourish us.",

That he is able, faithful and willing to do what he said he would? If we do, then why don't we pray or believe like we should? Why do we not cast our cares on him and leave them there instead of picking them back up and trying to do it ourselves? Bro. Wilkerson examines the passage in Jer. 17:5 \"Cursed be the man who trusteth in flesh\".\u00a0 This is a very important message for all. True faith in God results in an abiding peace and rest in your soul. When we haven't learned to trust God, he will bring us to a place of depth to train us to trust him no matter whats. God wants us to be prepared to trust him. He wants us to learn how to depend totally on him for everthing, completely surrendering to his will. Then comes the calm and rest.",

And people laid hold of it all over the place.  And I think before I got through preaching, many were filled with the Holy Ghost, and many got up, one by one, and testified that they had been healed of the most unbelievable diseases.

God will allow seasons of discouragement when; there is something hidden in our heart and He wants to get at it; when we take that which belongs to the Lord and keep it for ourselves; and when we fail to realize there is a divine purpose even in the darkest of times. We must cry out to God and ask Him to take away the perception that coming to Christ is all about us. We are not called to live for ourselves. It is Christ is in us for the betterment of others. When we understand this truth God will transform the valley of trouble into a gateway of hope!",

Too many people come to church with their mind elsewhere and are only going through the motions. We must be honest and keep our focus on the Lord when we come into his house. Wait on him, love him.

Jeremiah told them to be obedient and God would be with them and give them a hope and a future in the foreign godless country. So they went into exile and found it to be a godless nation. But God rose up mighty men of God like Daniel, Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego. And they shook that nation through their lives and testimony and God's Word spread through that nation through their testimony. Not that they didn't meet up with difficulties, but as they remained faithful to God He delivered them and through it glorified God.",

This is a title that is misused today and Wilkerson explains that in detail. This is a powerful message about the \"new thing\" God is doing in His Church. He is removing His Presence (though a \"feeling\" might still remain) from the idolatrous, and bringing those whose hearts are longing for Him in TRUTH into a \"new order\" -- that is, God's order. This new thing is not about success, prosperity, or a world-wide \"revival.\" God is stirring the hearts of His people (a remnant) into Holiness and righteousness and Truth. This message brings the blessing of God into the right perspective.",

He also saw God reduce Satan's empire into rubble in an instant. God saved the best wine for last. He's pouring out his spirit and those who seek his presence are feasting on wonderful things. Yet too many Christian homes are not a place where Christ's Spirit is presently manifested and God wants this to change. Only Jesus' manifest reality will melt Satan's bondage on your lost loved ones like wax. A wonderful message revealing just how God is going to deal with the enemy of our souls that will rejoice your spirit!",

They realised that they had sinned grievously, and were totally despondent. And then God's Word turned from judgement to mercy. Consider this carefully, for it is applicable to our day too. There are Christians who have been taken captive and live a defeated Christian life, as we read in Rom 7, \"For what I will to do, that I do not practice; but what I hate, that I do\". They realise and acknowledge their utter desperate state, and have grown despondent. God has pity and feels compassion on His people who have lost their way and acknowledge their desperate state and cry unto Him for mercy.",

The continuation and explanation of this grace flows naturally into the next verses. This grace and comfort is through true repentance, as this text shows. When it speaks of the \"voice of Him\" crying in the wilderness it is a direct reference to John the Baptist but is not limited to him, for it is God's own voice that declares this message which brings repentance, faith, and glory (as shown in verse 5). King Herod, in a moment of intoxication and lust promised his lover's daughter (who had eroticially danced at the wine-flowing party) \"up to half his kingdom\". Her mother, with a deep-seated hatred against John the Baptist seized the opportunity to demand his head on a platter. She hated John for openly declaring that it \"was not right for Herod to take his brother's wife\". Nevertheless, the decaptitation of John, did not silence \"the voice of Him\". Even after the death of John this voice continued to cry out; as it does even now.",

The Kingdom of God is a deep inward work where our heart moves forward in quietness and confidence. You cannot see it, you cannot hear it. It is an unseen work of the Holy Spirit. Some of the times God is doing the deepest work in our lives are the times when we are not hearing anything. These are seasons when God leads us by waters of quietness. God is building a temple where His glory will me manifested and He does it in quietness.Because we don't hear anything doesnt mean that nothing is going on. In the silence God is doing His most creative work.",

God has forgotten about me and my problem. 3. The wait is just too long. I can't carry on anymore. He brings encouragement from the Scriptures and shows how big, how caring, and how faithful our God is.",

He cannot sin. Natural man is born in sin. Some families (and even nations) are known for their sinful traits as being full of wrath, lazy, etc. The birth of Jesus was different from any other normal birth. He is fully God and fully man. He possessed two different natures. Being fully man He was tempted in all things like we are tempted, yet His delight was in the fear of God and He sinned not.",

Before one becomes a partaker of the divine nature, Major Thomas expounds what man in fact is.  We discover he is a living soul wrapped in flesh, needing the Spirit of God to breathe life into his Spirit.  Once the man is forgiven his goal must become, through grace, to allow and yield the Spirit\u2019s infiltration into jis soul and flesh that he may become an instrument of righteousness.",

Too many in the church don't have the spiritual authority the Lord said he gave his own over all power of the enemy. Paul warned in the last days people would have an appearance of godliness with no power. You can stand up to the devil and say enough! Enough of the powerlessness in your life. Enough of letting him by with laughing at you. Submit to God, and take back your family for God. Take back what the enemy has stolen.",

In Revival we need to not settle for too little too soon.  He pointed out that possibly Isaiah recorded the scripture in Isaiah 59:16 at that time (God was astonished that there was no one to intercede. He also feels that the greatest revival can not stop the judgment.  If there is a watchman that is sounding the alarm Jimmy Davis is sounding the alarm.",

But the disciples cried out in fear, not having the confidence, God was in their boat! The still didn't realize who Jesus was. We need to focus on those who need Jesus and are lost in this stormy world in these last days. No matter what storm we face as believers, we have Christ in the ship, so let's get away from the focus on self and focus on those around us who don't know the Savior! Woe to those who are at ease in Zion! (Amos 6:1).",

SPURGEON, AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON. \u201cThine eyes shall see the king in his beauty: they shall behold the land that is very far off.\u201d-Isaiah 33:17. WHEN the Assyrians had invaded Judea with an immense army, and were about to attack Jerusalem, Rab-shakeh was sent with a railing message to the king and his people. When Hezekiah heard of the blasphemies of the proud Assyrian, he rent his clothes and put on sackcloth, and went into the house of the Lord, and sent the elders of the priests covered with sackcloth to consult with Isaiah the prophet. The people of Jerusalem, therefore, had seen their king in most mournful array, wearing the garments of sorrow, and the weeds of mourning; they were, however, cheered by the promise that there should be so complete a defeat to Sennacherib, that the king should again adorn himself with the robes of state, and appear with a smiling countenance in all the beauty of joy. Moreover, through the invasion of Sennacherib, the people had not been able to travel; they had been cooped up within the walls of Jerusalem like prisoners. No journeys had been made, either in the direction of Dan or Beersheba, even the nearest villages could not be reached; but the promise is given, that so completely should the country be rid of the enemy, that wayfarers should be able to see the whole of their territory, even that part of the land which was very far off...",

They walk in the power of the Spirit and their heart is not here but in heaven with Jesus, and their mind is on heavenly things. God has a controversy when the nations of this world mistreat His Son's Body. Sinners and hypocrites in Zion will be afraid when God begins to move and shake things. They won't be prepared for there is no security unless you are IN CHRIST. Unless your life is hid in Him, and you are dead to this world and it's vain attractions.

Just as Jesus will prevail and accomplish the will of the Father we have the word of God given to us and it will accomplish in and through us all that the Father wills. The Bible says the word will not return void and it will prosper the thing it intended. This is a fantastic sermon (and a newer one) where Wilkerson preaches on the fact that although things around us seem to be heading one way in our society\u2026  none of that takes away from this simple fact.  Neither God\u2019s word nor His ways are changing just because the societal norm has shifted.",

SPURGEON, AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON. \u201cBehold, they shall be as stubble; the fire shall burn them; they shall not deliver themselves from the power of the flame: there shall not be a coal to warm at, nor fire to sit before it.\u201d-Isaiah 47:14. THIS text is part of a terrible description of God's judgment upon Babylon and Chaldea. The prophet had clearly written out the indictment of the Lord against that tyrannic people, and having proved their guilt he pronounces their sentence. He accused them of shewing no mercy to the inheritance of the Lord which, in his wrath, he had given into their hands. He charges them with pride and boastfulness, for Chaldea had said in her heart, \u201cI am, and there is none beside me;\u201d and Babylon had boasted, \u201cI shall be a lady for ever; I shall see no sorrow.\u201d He testifies against their over-boldness and presumption; for they were given to pleasures and lived carelessly, expecting no ill. Thus said the prophet, speaking in the name of the Lord, \u201cThou hast trusted in thy wickedness: thou hast said, None seeth me. Thy wisdom and thy knowledge, it hath perverted thee; and thou hast said in thine heart, I am, and none else beside me.\u201d On account of these iniquities the destruction of Chaldea and Babylon was to be sudden, terrible, and complete. They were to be so utterly destroyed...",

The message is centered on the verses between Revelation 3:14 to 3:22  Carter also uses verses from Mark chapter 4 to show the disciples fearfulness and lack of concern for others when they were in storm with Jesus in the boat.  The church of Laodicea had the same lack of concern for others with the self-centered life that they were in.  In Isaiah chapter 58, the message speaks of the fast that God has chosen instead of the fasts of pretence that the people of that time were doing.  Like the church of Laodicea, the people of Isaiah\u2019s day were living life for themselves with no concern or grief for the poor or suffering.  With these verses the message went into a parallel with much of the church of today that looks for self-help books, or seminaries, or even counseling without seeking God or God\u2019s word for problems.  Carter encourages married people with problems to look to Ephesians chapter 5 for an answer to problems instead of the counsel of someone who suggests that all your problems are from your third and forth generation.  The message ends with words about revival using the revival of Ezra where it speaks of the people weeping. Revival has a strange mixture of weeping and joy.  In revival the hearts of the people are broken and there is remorse.  The church of Laodicea did not weep for others.",

You may put your trust in other things, as in money, but the same woe will be on you unless you trust in the Lord.

The basic fruit of the Spirit is love it is at the heart of all the other fruits, the basis for the works of the flesh is self.

He uses this verse then different verses\\ with the disciples in boats during storms to show the need of having to learn a lesson of faith. In this message Carter shows how God allows his people to go through hard times so that they later are able to trust the Lord in the situations that they will go through in the future. Paul\u2019s life was also used in a parallel to the disciples to show how God uses trials to mold the people of God. His points are that there is a coming storm that God will allow and it is those people that learn trust in the current trials that they are going through that will be used in this future storm. The people who will be used in the future storm are the man or woman of God that can say {I believe God} when the storm is happening.",

Herein lies an exhortation to seriously consider what a work of God really is, and what will truly glorify him.  In order to truly cover the naked, and be Eunuch\u2019s for God, we must operate out of his utter rest.",

God in His mercy will take us by the hand and lead us outside of the mindset of selfishness and self consumption. God is calling us to escape to the mountain of calvary where self dies, and we move out of the realm of \"self\" and a \"me first\" mindset to the giving of ourselves for the Glory of God. God desires to baptize us with His compassion to put others first. Do you want your heart marked with the compassion of Jesus Christ?",

            "description": "Paul Washer sets out to answer the question of where his passion comes from, and in so doing he traces a path to the holiness and extra-ordinary majesty of God as seen by Isaiah. He reveals his own love for Godly men of old, who thought great thoughts about God, and whose writings have been influential in his own life. Reading from some of their writings, as well as his own notes, he explains something of what Isaiah saw. The Apostle John shows that Isaiah saw a revelation of the Son (thereby proving his eternal deity), yet Isaiah saw only an image, reduced to what his finite capacity could receive. Holiness is so much more than we think; holiness is the highest statement which could ever be made in regard to God; it speaks of separateness and uniqueness. And what is the effect of its revelation? We are faced with our own uncleanness and nothingness in the presence of a holy God; yet at the same time a Saviour is revealed to us in his condescending love. Let all flesh be abased, that God\u2019s glory may be the more elevated. (73 minutes)",
