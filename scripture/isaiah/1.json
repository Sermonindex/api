Too many people come to church with their mind elsewhere and are only going through the motions. We must be honest and keep our focus on the Lord when we come into his house. Wait on him, love him. God wants to take the burden out of those who are coming before him. He doesn't want us going through the motions of coming to church heavy with burdens we are trying to deal with ourselves.",

We want to know all the facts about God, ourselves and our relationship with the Creator. What about sin? What about judgment? What about Heaven and hell? Dr. Tozer says that no other philosophy on earth deals with all the facts of life, death and God \u2013 only Christianity. It is the believer\u2019s voice of reason.",
