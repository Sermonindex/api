Tozer and spoke of him as one of the most influential voices in the Church in America. A.W. Tozer's materials are a mainstay in Evangelical churches in our day and he is one of the most quoted authors. He was a prophet in his day and his writings are even more influential in our day.

God used him to have a powerful prophetic insight into the end-times and the coming suffering of the jewish people before the great accepting of Jesus as Messiah. His eschatological insight is a very needful truth to be realized in the body of Christ. \r\n\r\nArt was a prophetic voice insofar as he called his listeners to purposes in God that would affect both time and eternity, purposes that had to do with the glory of God in the Church.   Frequently, his messages called the Church to an awareness of the Last Days [End-times] in such a way that made that time seem imminent and at the door.",

Though Christians are accused of letting their imaginations run away with them, we actually deal in reality because of our insistence in stripping everything down to the hard core. We want to know all the facts about God, ourselves and our relationship with the Creator. What about sin? What about judgment? What about Heaven and hell? Dr. Tozer says that no other philosophy on earth deals with all the facts of life, death and God \u2013 only Christianity. It is the believer\u2019s voice of reason.",
