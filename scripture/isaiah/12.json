We are still commanded to stop up the wells of the enemy and old nature, and by asking the Holy Spirit to show us each one and lead us through the enemy territory in our own minds, to stop up each one. God will give you strength to not make peace with these things he will lead you to each area where the enemy has gained a foothold and sends out streams of lies to hinder you or lead you differently than the Lord wants you to go and take authority over them and stop them up. Wonderful message of deliverance from torment of the mind.",
