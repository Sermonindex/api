If one is not submissive but rebellious in spirit, there is a great danger of pride and sin. Many warnings are given in Scripture towards that state of rebellion and un-submissiveness in a believer\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s life. We must recognize God\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sovereignty and rule over all creation, our lives and the Church. We must submit our minds to the authority of Scripture as we submit to God in our spirits; He owns us now.",

Before one becomes a partaker of the divine nature, Major Thomas expounds what man in fact is.  We discover he is a living soul wrapped in flesh, needing the Spirit of God to breathe life into his Spirit.  Once the man is forgiven his goal must become, through grace, to allow and yield the Spirit\u2019s infiltration into jis soul and flesh that he may become an instrument of righteousness.",

It began, as all such evil careers begin, with a wayward thought that gained traction. A fascinating glimpse into the life in Heaven before Lucifer\u2019s fall from grace.",
