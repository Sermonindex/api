Where ever we walk in the Word of God, when we begin to see the promises of God through the eyes of faith and realize they are for us, personally, things will begin to change. The difference between the kingdom of this world and the kingdom of God are contrasted in this message. An exciting truth!!",

But even in spite of dreadful knowledge of what was coming, they did not despair of hope. They knew God had mercy and compassion, and would not destroy the righteous with the wicked. There are hard times coming but those who keep their minds stayed on the Lord will have perfect peace. No matter what happens, God is in control and is reigning on his throne.",

            "description": "Carter starts this message out at Isaiah 24:10 where the word speaks of a hard time that is to come. He uses this verse then different verses\\ with the disciples in boats during storms to show the need of having to learn a lesson of faith. In this message Carter shows how God allows his people to go through hard times so that they later are able to trust the Lord in the situations that they will go through in the future. Paul\u2019s life was also used in a parallel to the disciples to show how God uses trials to mold the people of God. His points are that there is a coming storm that God will allow and it is those people that learn trust in the current trials that they are going through that will be used in this future storm. The people who will be used in the future storm are the man or woman of God that can say {I believe God} when the storm is happening.",

These are they who are crying out to God, who still hunger and thirst after righteousness, inspite of the apostasy in the mainstream church, and a sin-sick world, there are those who still hunger for God. This is a sobering message reflective of today's society, but ends in a joyous certainty of the victory and provision of our Lord for his people.",
