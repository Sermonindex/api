He also saw God reduce Satan's empire into rubble in an instant. God saved the best wine for last. He's pouring out his spirit and those who seek his presence are feasting on wonderful things. Yet too many Christian homes are not a place where Christ's Spirit is presently manifested and God wants this to change. Only Jesus' manifest reality will melt Satan's bondage on your lost loved ones like wax. A wonderful message revealing just how God is going to deal with the enemy of our souls that will rejoice your spirit!",
