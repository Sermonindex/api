God however warned them that it would bode ill for them if they trusted in man, horses and chariots for deliverance. They should in the first place trust the Lord. You may put your trust in other things, as in money, but the same woe will be on you unless you trust in the Lord. King Asa was a great king; but when he was old and diseased in his feat, he sought the help of physicians and did not trust the Lord. Because of this he lost out on many blessings!",
