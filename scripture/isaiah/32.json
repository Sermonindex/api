Too many in the church don't have the spiritual authority the Lord said he gave his own over all power of the enemy. Paul warned in the last days people would have an appearance of godliness with no power. You can stand up to the devil and say enough! Enough of the powerlessness in your life. Enough of letting him by with laughing at you. Submit to God, and take back your family for God. Take back what the enemy has stolen.",
