He teaches how your home can become a \"haven of rest and refreshment\" by taking proactive leadership with your children in the good and right way.  Four ways of establishing calm, quiet authority are addressed along with four categories of parenting, good and bad.",

Do you have a supply of the Holy Spirit to sustain you And to minister to those around you who are nearly insane with fear when the next terrorist bomb kills hundreds of thousands? The Holy Spirit is the administrator of the peace of Christ. We must have an outpouring of the Spirit before the coming judgments- but the Spirit will fall only upon those who pray, who rise up and tremble at His Word, who strip themselves of all confidence in the flesh, who seek a broken spirit and a contrite heart, who ask in faith.\r\nProphetic Message",

Submit, forgive yourself for your mistakes. Go to the cross for cleansing. Seek the Lord and he will do the work in you. Excellent message on spiritual warfare. Too many in the church don't have the spiritual authority the Lord said he gave his own over all power of the enemy. Paul warned in the last days people would have an appearance of godliness with no power. You can stand up to the devil and say enough! Enough of the powerlessness in your life. Enough of letting him by with laughing at you. Submit to God, and take back your family for God. Take back what the enemy has stolen.",
