The Lord is calling His church to rise up and take courage and trust God. He will begin to fill us with His grace and peace. God in these last days wants to give us an understanding of His love to keep us standing strong and secure .",

            "description": "Zion represents the overcoming, last days church. Not everybody who says Lord, Lord is going to make it in. Those who have been in the heavenly places with Christ, and are overcoming believers. They are overcoming the flesh, the devil, and the world. They walk in the power of the Spirit and their heart is not here but in heaven with Jesus, and their mind is on heavenly things. God has a controversy when the nations of this world mistreat His Son's Body. Sinners and hypocrites in Zion will be afraid when God begins to move and shake things. They won't be prepared for there is no security unless you are IN CHRIST. Unless your life is hid in Him, and you are dead to this world and it's vain attractions. The enemy is coming in like a flood against God's people, but remember, He sits, as KING of the flood.",
