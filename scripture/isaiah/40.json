            "description": "\u201cOn Laying Aside Certain Things\u201d is part 18 of Pastor A. W. Tozer\u2019s delightful, 34-part series based upon Peter\u2019s first epistle. The message was preached in Chicago, Illinois, on January 24, 1954, and it addresses 1 Peter 2:1-3, as well as 1 Peter 1:23-25 (from Isaiah 40:6-7.) Pastor Tozer treats us to several very astute word studies: \u201cwherefore,\u201d \u201claying aside,\u201d \u201cguile,\u201d \u201chypocrisies,\u201d \u201cenvies,\u201d and \u201csincere milk.\u201d Without rebirth, the most promising child, the actress in Hollywood, the president in the White House, and the eugenicists\u2019 theoretical \u201csuper man,\u201d all exist beneath the same two, dark clouds: mortality and corruption. Men die and then they rot; thank God for the birth that is incorruptible and never dies! Drawing wisely from Socrates, Pastor Tozer also challenges those liberals who ask, instead of turning from wickedness, \u201cWhat is wickedness?\u201d The length of the recording is 39 minutes and 5 seconds.",

He was involved in the missionary alliance movement for most of his pulpit life. A.W. Tozer lived in the presence of God he saw clearly and he spoke as a prophet to the church. He sought for God's honor with the zeal of Elijah and mourned with Jeremiah at the apostasy of God's people. \r\n\r\nLeonard Ravenhill was a close friend of pastor and writer A. W. Tozer and spoke of him as one of the most influential voices in the Church in America. A.W. Tozer's materials are a mainstay in Evangelical churches in our day and he is one of the most quoted authors. He was a prophet in his day and his writings are even more influential in our day. One of his books: The Pursuit of God, has had over 1 million copies sold world-wide.",

The continuation and explanation of this grace flows naturally into the next verses. This grace and comfort is through true repentance, as this text shows. When it speaks of the \"voice of Him\" crying in the wilderness it is a direct reference to John the Baptist but is not limited to him, for it is God's own voice that declares this message which brings repentance, faith, and glory (as shown in verse 5). King Herod, in a moment of intoxication and lust promised his lover's daughter (who had eroticially danced at the wine-flowing party) \"up to half his kingdom\". Her mother, with a deep-seated hatred against John the Baptist seized the opportunity to demand his head on a platter. She hated John for openly declaring that it \"was not right for Herod to take his brother's wife\". Nevertheless, the decaptitation of John, did not silence \"the voice of Him\". Even after the death of John this voice continued to cry out; as it does even now.",
