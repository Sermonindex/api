            "description": "\u201cOn Laying Aside Certain Things\u201d is part 18 of Pastor A. W. Tozer\u2019s delightful, 34-part series based upon Peter\u2019s first epistle. The message was preached in Chicago, Illinois, on January 24, 1954, and it addresses 1 Peter 2:1-3, as well as 1 Peter 1:23-25 (from Isaiah 40:6-7.) Pastor Tozer treats us to several very astute word studies: \u201cwherefore,\u201d \u201claying aside,\u201d \u201cguile,\u201d \u201chypocrisies,\u201d \u201cenvies,\u201d and \u201csincere milk.\u201d Without rebirth, the most promising child, the actress in Hollywood, the president in the White House, and the eugenicists\u2019 theoretical \u201csuper man,\u201d all exist beneath the same two, dark clouds: mortality and corruption. Men die and then they rot; thank God for the birth that is incorruptible and never dies! Drawing wisely from Socrates, Pastor Tozer also challenges those liberals who ask, instead of turning from wickedness, \u201cWhat is wickedness?\u201d The length of the recording is 39 minutes and 5 seconds.",

It is realized then that it was not the work of men385 but the work of God. To bring maximum glory to His Name the Lord is assembling an end times movement of weak, poor, helpless, and despised people who the religious system of our day have written off as unusable for their purposes.",

He wants us not living on bread (prosperity) promises alone, but by every promise in the Word of God. To not fully trust God is to strip him of all he wants to be and can be to us and bring him down to the level of a dead idol. It's a grievous sin in God's eyes to have unbelief, and the church needs to realize it.",

God will allow seasons of discouragement when; there is something hidden in our heart and He wants to get at it; when we take that which belongs to the Lord and keep it for ourselves; and when we fail to realize there is a divine purpose even in the darkest of times. We must cry out to God and ask Him to take away the perception that coming to Christ is all about us. We are not called to live for ourselves. It is Christ is in us for the betterment of others. When we understand this truth God will transform the valley of trouble into a gateway of hope!",

They realised that they had sinned grievously, and were totally despondent. And then God's Word turned from judgement to mercy. Consider this carefully, for it is applicable to our day too. There are Christians who have been taken captive and live a defeated Christian life, as we read in Rom 7, \"For what I will to do, that I do not practice; but what I hate, that I do\". They realise and acknowledge their utter desperate state, and have grown despondent. God has pity and feels compassion on His people who have lost their way and acknowledge their desperate state and cry unto Him for mercy.",

The continuation and explanation of this grace flows naturally into the next verses. This grace and comfort is through true repentance, as this text shows. When it speaks of the \"voice of Him\" crying in the wilderness it is a direct reference to John the Baptist but is not limited to him, for it is God's own voice that declares this message which brings repentance, faith, and glory (as shown in verse 5). King Herod, in a moment of intoxication and lust promised his lover's daughter (who had eroticially danced at the wine-flowing party) \"up to half his kingdom\". Her mother, with a deep-seated hatred against John the Baptist seized the opportunity to demand his head on a platter. She hated John for openly declaring that it \"was not right for Herod to take his brother's wife\". Nevertheless, the decaptitation of John, did not silence \"the voice of Him\". Even after the death of John this voice continued to cry out; as it does even now.",
