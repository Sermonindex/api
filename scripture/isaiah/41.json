Only the meek and lowly can be mightily used of God, whose strength is made perfect in weakness. In the Kingdom of heaven the way up is down! \"Blessed are the meek.\" \"He who humbles himself will be exalted.\" Ravenhill recommends reading Isaiah 40 every day to keep in view the supremacy and all-sufficiency of the Lord.",

They were haughty and did detestable things before me. Therefore I did away with them as you have seen\" Ezekiel 16:49. Jackie gives a short, deep and challenging call to go and minister to the poor with a broken heart. Her message is followed by personal testimonies. The recording ends in weeping over the hardness of our hearts and for the poor. Real ministry is to show people the Lord of the Word: \"They will know what He is like by what you are like. So you live it with your life and they will read you like an epistle.\" Whenever the destitute cry out, God will respond by sending a person, and it could be you. God works through people. Jackie also points out that the poor don't need training in evangelism, as evangelism is simply \"one poor man telling another poor man where to find bread\".",
