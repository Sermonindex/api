A \"20th-century prophet\" many called him during his lifetime. For 31 years A.W.Tozer was pastor of Southside Alliance Church in Chicago. He was involved in the missionary alliance movement for most of his pulpit life. A.W. Tozer lived in the presence of God he saw clearly and he spoke as a prophet to the church. He sought for God's honor with the zeal of Elijah and mourned with Jeremiah at the apostasy of God's people. \r\n\r\nLeonard Ravenhill was a close friend of pastor and writer A. W. Tozer and spoke of him as one of the most influential voices in the Church in America. A.W. Tozer's materials are a mainstay in Evangelical churches in our day and he is one of the most quoted authors. He was a prophet in his day and his writings are even more influential in our day. One of his books: The Pursuit of God, has had over 1 million copies sold world-wide.",

The reason we don't see God move is that we think that someone else besides us is blocking the moving of the Spirit. Included is a very interesting narrative about Dr. Ernest M. Wadsworth that documents his efforts for ministers to look inward to unblock the hindrance to revival, as well as many angry church members that called him during the week after being told to 'make your crooked places straight.' \"I went to the office of the mayor and was ushered into a private room. After I was seated, he said, 'I heard your sermon yesterday morning, now; man to man, I want to know who's been telling you about me?'\"",
