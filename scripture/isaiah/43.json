This is a title that is misused today and Wilkerson explains that in detail. This is a powerful message about the \"new thing\" God is doing in His Church. He is removing His Presence (though a \"feeling\" might still remain) from the idolatrous, and bringing those whose hearts are longing for Him in TRUTH into a \"new order\" -- that is, God's order. This new thing is not about success, prosperity, or a world-wide \"revival.\" God is stirring the hearts of His people (a remnant) into Holiness and righteousness and Truth. This message brings the blessing of God into the right perspective.",
