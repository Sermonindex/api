The evangelical organization Desiring God is named for his book Desiring God: Meditations of a Christian Hedonist (1986).\r\n\r\nIn 1980, after what he described as an \"irresistible call of the Lord to preach\", Piper became Pastor of Bethlehem Baptist Church in Minneapolis, Minnesota, where he has been ministering ever since. Piper hit the evangelical scene after the publication of his book Desiring God: Meditations of a Christian Hedonist (1986) and has continued to publish dozens of other books further articulating this theological perspective. In 1994, he founded Desiring God Ministries, which provides all of Piper's sermons and articles from the past three decades, and most of his books online free of charge, as well as offering for sale books, CDs, and DVDs and regularly hosting conferences.",

This is a title that is misused today and Wilkerson explains that in detail. This is a powerful message about the \"new thing\" God is doing in His Church. He is removing His Presence (though a \"feeling\" might still remain) from the idolatrous, and bringing those whose hearts are longing for Him in TRUTH into a \"new order\" -- that is, God's order. This new thing is not about success, prosperity, or a world-wide \"revival.\" God is stirring the hearts of His people (a remnant) into Holiness and righteousness and Truth. This message brings the blessing of God into the right perspective.",
