I shall come at once to the text, and notice that, first, we must expect a measure of decrease in the Church; but then, secondly, we may expect a great increase in the Church; and, thirdly, from what this text has to say upon that subject, and for other reasons also, we ought to be encouraged to seek the increase of the Church of God.",

At the time Jeremiah gave this word there were also other false prophets saying that it would go bad with them in exile. But they were false prophets. Jeremiah told them to be obedient and God would be with them and give them a hope and a future in the foreign godless country. So they went into exile and found it to be a godless nation. But God rose up mighty men of God like Daniel, Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego. And they shook that nation through their lives and testimony and God's Word spread through that nation through their testimony. Not that they didn't meet up with difficulties, but as they remained faithful to God He delivered them and through it glorified God.",

The enemy will come with lies to discourage us and that lie is to get us to think that we have labored in vain because of unanswered prayers and shattered expectations. It is very dangerous to allow this lie to fester in our heart. The Holy Spirit will awaken our spirit and mind to the truth that God will not fail us and that the verdict of our life is in His hands.",
