God in His mercy will take us by the hand and lead us outside of the mindset of selfishness and self consumption. God is calling us to escape to the mountain of calvary where self dies, and we move out of the realm of \"self\" and a \"me first\" mindset to the giving of ourselves for the Glory of God.
