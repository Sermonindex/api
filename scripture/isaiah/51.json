We sadly see many abuses of Spirit-led living in modern Christendom but this should make us all the more hungry for the true manifestation. We are impotent without the infilling power of the Spirit. When we have God in the midst everything changes. We will not be able to stay quiet, we will speak boldly for our Lord that bought us with such a great price.1003 The underground Church in China chooses their leadership from those who are the hungriest after God. Are you hungry for the living God? For His power displayed in your life?",

Likewise, today he's addressing every Christian who's become captive to some form of bondage. This is a powerful message of encouragement to every Christian who is fighting a battle of the mind, under attack by the enemy, who have become discouraged. God wants to deliver you.",
