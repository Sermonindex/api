But now a message of hope appears, an invitation to come to Him, to eat and drink of Him; extended to those who have no means of buying or paying, nothing to give - destitute. If they will come to Him, through his Messiah, they will find abundant life. And throughout the chapter God speaks to convince them with many arguments. (78 minutes)",

Not leaders that seek their own honor or use believers to exalt themselves. Rather, servant leaders who emulate Jesus Christ and desire others in the body to come to full maturity in the Lord. Hence, in the end, leaders raise up other leaders, for that is the goal; true servanthood\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s aim is for others. To submit to such leaders who share in the character of the early Apostles and the Lord will be of great benefit and blessing to gatherings. Un-submission leads to carnality and is the first sin of the devil950 who did not submit to God\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s authority over him.",

In this sermon Spurgeon wonderfully offers the Gospel, \"without money and without price\" to everyone w ho is able to \"know enough to know yourself a lost sinner, and Christ a great Saviour.\" He pleads with poor sinners that no matter how great their sin may be, his mercy is, and always will be, greater. He takes use of many examples of people who try to get into heaven with money, with price. He explains how many people without God spend their days trying not to focus on Eternity, and trying to focus instead on the temporal. He charges the person thus without God to instead dare ponder his own soul's destination, that he will spend forever in Hell until he turns to the cross of Christ. Then he offers a firm and resolute \"entreat to believe on the Lord Jesus.\"",

Just as Jesus will prevail and accomplish the will of the Father we have the word of God given to us and it will accomplish in and through us all that the Father wills. The Bible says the word will not return void and it will prosper the thing it intended. This is a fantastic sermon (and a newer one) where Wilkerson preaches on the fact that although things around us seem to be heading one way in our society\u2026  none of that takes away from this simple fact.  Neither God\u2019s word nor His ways are changing just because the societal norm has shifted.",
