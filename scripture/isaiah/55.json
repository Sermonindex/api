But now a message of hope appears, an invitation to come to Him, to eat and drink of Him; extended to those who have no means of buying or paying, nothing to give - destitute. If they will come to Him, through his Messiah, they will find abundant life. And throughout the chapter God speaks to convince them with many arguments. (78 minutes)",

He takes use of many examples of people who try to get into heaven with money, with price. He explains how many people without God spend their days trying not to focus on Eternity, and trying to focus instead on the temporal. He charges the person thus without God to instead dare ponder his own soul's destination, that he will spend forever in Hell until he turns to the cross of Christ. Then he offers a firm and resolute \"entreat to believe on the Lord Jesus.\"",
