Pastor Chuck was used in the Jesus People revival where he was used along with others to minister to the hippy young people. They saw a work of the Spirit where many were added to the church and discipled. He has raised up many pastors who are a part of the Calvary Chapel movement now and where he pastors the large Costa Mesa church in California.\r\n\r\nThe Calvary Chapel movement is based of simple principles that Chuck Smith taught over the years such as: The priority of agape love, Simple fellowship amongst the saints, the breaking of bread, the teaching of God's word chapter by chapter and verse by verse. And lastly and most importantly the principle not by might nor by power but by my spirit saith the Lord.",

Much of the church is fast asleep as the foolish virgins with no oil were, in Matt. 25. How do you know if you are ready? Get your eyes on Jesus, focus on his purposes for your life, not the things of this world, (Col 3:1-3), Stay in the Word daily; seeking him, for how shall you escape if you neglect so great a salvation? (Heb. 2:3). Settle every grudge, forgive those who have hurt you and don't be a smiter or unbeliever!\u00a0If you really BELIEVE he's coming, does your life reflect that? Or are you at ease in Zion? Pray before you listen to this, and while you listen to this, for the Holy Spirit to shed his Light in your heart.",

Herein lies an exhortation to seriously consider what a work of God really is, and what will truly glorify him.  In order to truly cover the naked, and be Eunuch\u2019s for God, we must operate out of his utter rest.",

He was radically converted by reading the New Testament. God used him to have a powerful prophetic insight into the end-times and the coming suffering of the jewish people before the great accepting of Jesus as Messiah. His eschatological insight is a very needful truth to be realized in the body of Christ. \r\n\r\nArt was a prophetic voice insofar as he called his listeners to purposes in God that would affect both time and eternity, purposes that had to do with the glory of God in the Church.   Frequently, his messages called the Church to an awareness of the Last Days [End-times] in such a way that made that time seem imminent and at the door.",
