Amidst this great crisis, the Church seems to be sleeping. We desperately need true revival from heaven.

We pray that this is just not another conference or meeting, but a crisis point that we can hear clearly God\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s heart and respond with repentance and prayer. It is not too late for God to send revival, revive His Church, and win the lost world to Himself.\r\n\r\nAll speakers have come freely on their own accord not recieving any honorium. The event is 100% free. SermonIndex does not recieve any money from the event. We have prayerfully selected 12 speakers to seek the face of God and give us God\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s heart for the current hour. Would you consider being a part of this event in 2018 and being part of the solution of praying for revival?

Paul Washer said he was one of the most godly men he met in Canada.\r\n\r\nBill Mcleod had been praying and had his congregation praying for revival for years. On, October 17, 1971, God in His sovereignty came in revival. Without human means or explanation, the revival spread from church to church, community to community, city to city, and not long after from province to province. This has become known as the 1971 Canadian Revival movement.",
