There are alot of profound statements given by Keith Daniel throughout the sermon, namely a prophetic voicing of the next revival of religion and how it will be birthed through persection of a servere degree. This is a great recording to really put in perspective your anguish and trials in the Chrisitan life.",

He points out that if there is any book of the Bible that is relevant to America today it is the book of Jeremiah  (dealing with moral & spiritual decay).  In Revival we need to not settle for too little too soon.  He pointed out that possibly Isaiah recorded the scripture in Isaiah 59:16 at that time (God was astonished that there was no one to intercede. He also feels that the greatest revival can not stop the judgment.  If there is a watchman that is sounding the alarm Jimmy Davis is sounding the alarm.",
