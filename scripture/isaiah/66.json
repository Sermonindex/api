            "description": "Dr. Thompson touches on the difference between \u201cgoing to Heaven\u201d versus \u201cgoing to The Father.\u201d He addresses the problems with the King James word \u201cmansion\u201d in our understanding of what God is doing. He discusses in depth John 14:3. The \u201chouse\u201d referred to in the phrase \u201cIn My Father\u2019s House\u2026\u201d is not Heaven, but Jesus Himself \u2013 Jesus is the house of God. Not that Heaven does not exist, but it is not the goal. Jesus is the Father\u2019s house, and He makes a place in Himself for us, so that we become a room in that house. This sermon is practical, and it will stretch your brain a bit. (49 minutes 36 seconds)",
