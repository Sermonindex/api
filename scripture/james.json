For many of us having mercy or asking: Am I correct in feeling this way? can become an afterthought. Scripture reminds us to examine ourselves first. Judging, criticizing, maligning character, slandering and speaking to tear down another is probably one of the easiest things to do. Sadly, in the Christianity of our day such unedifying practices are applauded as righteous and discerning. Tearing down has become a ministry preoccupation with many in the blogosphere and Internet in general.",

He has been building a pure pristine Book of Acts fellowship in House Church networks all over rural China. There is a simplicity to the move of God yet such fervency, love, and desire born in the hearts of these believers. We need to break out of the simple 1 hour church meeting patterns, and start to serve the Lord with full commitment like many of these precious brothers and sisters in the Lord. For many of us the questions and truths that are revealed are very important for us to hear as we gather under the Headship of Jesus Christ in local areas.",

In this case we are encouraging a chronological reading of the Scriptures. Most of the confusion is created when certain teachers, groups, or denominations take singular verses out of context and compare them with others. Though it is a good spiritual principle to compare spiritual truths with spiritual truths,1139 yet this must all be done in the larger context of God\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Word.

They will forbid and command prodigals not to come into the presence of God until you work your way back into His favor through human effort and religion.

There are many hard teachings and doctrines in the Bible yet under all of these things the mercy and love of God are paramount. At times we can \"choke\" and \"judge\" others without mercy. May God give us the mercy and love of Christ in our Christian walks. A very searching sermon. Do we REALLY fulfill the royal law?  God is after the Pharisee in us, and it is His great mercy to do so to set us free.  The danger in being separated to God is to really think you know and judge others critically and keep others away at a distance because they're not as easy to get along with.",

For what is your life? It is even a vapor, that appeareth for a little time, and then vanisheth away. For that ye ought to say, If the Lord will, we shall live, and do this or that. But now ye rejoice in your boastings: all such rejoicing is evil. Therefore to him that knoweth to do good, and doeth it not, to him it is sin.\u201d \u2014 James 4:13-17 MEN today are just the same as when these words were first written. We still find people saying what they are going to do today, tomorrow, or in six months time, at the end of another year, and perhaps still further. I have no doubt there are persons here who have their own career mapped out before them pretty distinctly, and they feel well-nigh certain that they will realize it all. We are like the men of the past; and this Book, though it has been written so long, might have been written yesterday, so exactly does it describe human nature as it is at the end of this nineteenth century.

While Paul was affirming the power of real saving faith, James was criticizing the impotency of empty professing faith.  The sermon ends with Pauls\u2019 exhortation. \u201cExamine yourselves whether ye be in the faith.\u201d  (Interesting side note: McGee claimed as inaccurate the familiar story that Martin Luther called James an \u201cEpistle of straw\u201d.)",

When the man  is found by the neighboring citizens, clothed and sitting at the feet of Jesus in his right mind, instead of rejoicing at his deliverance, they reject Jesus, and ask him to leave for they are unwilling to follow him if it means losing their pigs. Many are unwilling to trust their life to Jesus, and are holding back part of themselves, unwilling to surrender, having counted the cost and the price too high. If you are happy with average, this message isn't for you. If you are determined to follow Jesus, wholly,  listen with an open heart.",

            "description": "McGee asks the question \u201cWhat is Worldliness?\u201d He begins his answer by first dismissing some of the more popular answers such as carnal amusement, running with wrong people, inappropriate dress, preoccupation with money, and neglecting the church. Instead, true worldliness is the jealousy, the pride, the rivalries, and the selfish ambitions we invite into our churches. The sermon ends with a call for renewed consecration to God and humble communion with one another.",
