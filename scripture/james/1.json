In this case we are encouraging a chronological reading of the Scriptures. Most of the confusion is created when certain teachers, groups, or denominations take singular verses out of context and compare them with others. Though it is a good spiritual principle to compare spiritual truths with spiritual truths,1139 yet this must all be done in the larger context of God\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Word. Therefore we are encouraging all of God\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s saints to have a consistent discipline of reading through the whole Scriptures once a year as a supplemental reading plan.",

They will forbid and command prodigals not to come into the presence of God until you work your way back into His favor through human effort and religion.
