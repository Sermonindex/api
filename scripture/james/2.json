There are many hard teachings and doctrines in the Bible yet under all of these things the mercy and love of God are paramount. At times we can \"choke\" and \"judge\" others without mercy. May God give us the mercy and love of Christ in our Christian walks. A very searching sermon. Do we REALLY fulfill the royal law?  God is after the Pharisee in us, and it is His great mercy to do so to set us free.  The danger in being separated to God is to really think you know and judge others critically and keep others away at a distance because they're not as easy to get along with.",

God used him to have a powerful prophetic insight into the end-times and the coming suffering of the jewish people before the great accepting of Jesus as Messiah. His eschatological insight is a very needful truth to be realized in the body of Christ. \r\n\r\nArt was a prophetic voice insofar as he called his listeners to purposes in God that would affect both time and eternity, purposes that had to do with the glory of God in the Church.   Frequently, his messages called the Church to an awareness of the Last Days [End-times] in such a way that made that time seem imminent and at the door.",

            "description": "Prepare to be convicted if you are holding back on God. Luke 8:27-40. Jesus is met by a possessed man in the Gadarene tombs, who has many devils, and they with fear and trembling (James 2:19) beg Jesus to let them go into a nearby herd of pigs, rather than banish them to the pit, and he allows them to go. When the man  is found by the neighboring citizens, clothed and sitting at the feet of Jesus in his right mind, instead of rejoicing at his deliverance, they reject Jesus, and ask him to leave for they are unwilling to follow him if it means losing their pigs. Many are unwilling to trust their life to Jesus, and are holding back part of themselves, unwilling to surrender, having counted the cost and the price too high. If you are happy with average, this message isn't for you. If you are determined to follow Jesus, wholly,  listen with an open heart.",
