There are many hard teachings and doctrines in the Bible yet under all of these things the mercy and love of God are paramount. At times we can \"choke\" and \"judge\" others without mercy. May God give us the mercy and love of Christ in our Christian walks. A very searching sermon. Do we REALLY fulfill the royal law?  God is after the Pharisee in us, and it is His great mercy to do so to set us free.  The danger in being separated to God is to really think you know and judge others critically and keep others away at a distance because they're not as easy to get along with.",

Many are unwilling to trust their life to Jesus, and are holding back part of themselves, unwilling to surrender, having counted the cost and the price too high.
