They saw a work of the Spirit where many were added to the church and discipled. He has raised up many pastors who are a part of the Calvary Chapel movement now and where he pastors the large Costa Mesa church in California.\r\n\r\nThe Calvary Chapel movement is based of simple principles that Chuck Smith taught over the years such as: The priority of agape love, Simple fellowship amongst the saints, the breaking of bread, the teaching of God's word chapter by chapter and verse by verse. And lastly and most importantly the principle not by might nor by power but by my spirit saith the Lord.",

For many of us having mercy or asking: Am I correct in feeling this way? can become an afterthought. Scripture reminds us to examine ourselves first. Judging, criticizing, maligning character, slandering and speaking to tear down another is probably one of the easiest things to do. Sadly, in the Christianity of our day such unedifying practices are applauded as righteous and discerning. Tearing down has become a ministry preoccupation with many in the blogosphere and Internet in general.",

            "description": "McGee asks the question \u201cWhat is Worldliness?\u201d He begins his answer by first dismissing some of the more popular answers such as carnal amusement, running with wrong people, inappropriate dress, preoccupation with money, and neglecting the church. Instead, true worldliness is the jealousy, the pride, the rivalries, and the selfish ambitions we invite into our churches. The sermon ends with a call for renewed consecration to God and humble communion with one another.",
