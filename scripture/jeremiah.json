            "description": "Daniel 9 is one of the most incredible prophecies in the whole of the Bible because of it's accuracy in fulfillment, Daniel in this passge is reading his Bible, specifically Jeremiah, he reads about how the people of Israel will go into captivity for 70 years and realises he is living in the fullfilment of that prophecy, Daniel believed the Bible literally and thus the 70 years he read about in the book of Jeremiah he believed was 70 years in reality.  Daniel is moved by what he reads and begins to intercede for the his people, he prays that the Lord would take this 70 years from the first move into captivity in 605BC and not 597BC.  Daniel was the 'chief of staff' for Babylon and still had time to pray in this incredible way, he set his face to seek the Lord and begn to repent for the sins of Israel and he begged the Lord to turn away His anger from His people and for the sake of His own righteousness restore His people.  The Lord answered Daniel's prayer.",

A fire will burn in us to walk out our calling. God allows twisted situations in our lives of being hurt and misunderstood and we must prevail against our enemies through the faithfulness of Jesus. God understands our pain and He will instill us a faith in that fire that can\u2019t be shaken. Preaching from the book of Jeremiah, Wilkerson preaches on a popular passage of Scripture.

And there are other tears, too, which are the evidences not of weakness, but of might \u2014 the tears of tender sympathy are the children of strong affection, and they are strong like their parents. He that loves much, must weep much. The unfeeling heart, the unloving spirit, may pass from earth's portal to its utmost bound almost without a sigh except for itself; but he that loves, has dug as many wells of tears as he has chosen objects of affection; for by as many as our friends are multiplied, by so many must our griefs be multiplied too, if we have love enough to share in their griefs and to bear their burden for them. It needs a mighty prophet like Jeremiah to weep as mightily as he. May we have more weeping in our churches.",

Often times it may well just be one area that remains but nonetheless folks continue in that sin.  Wilkerson preaches a very personal message here and he shares his heart and shows his own weakness as an example.  The consequences for a Christian continuing in sin are sobering, but he gave us what we needed to overcome sin, if we want to. For those who are sick of their sin, and hate it, and cry out to God, there is wonderful news. He will empower you, and he wants to put his fear in your heart so you will not turn away from him, and then he can take you into the fullness of the new covenant. Powerful preaching, with a gentle compassion for those who are struggling.",

Why do we not cast our cares on him and leave them there instead of picking them back up and trying to do it ourselves? Bro. Wilkerson examines the passage in Jer. 17:5 \"Cursed be the man who trusteth in flesh\".\u00a0 This is a very important message for all. True faith in God results in an abiding peace and rest in your soul. When we haven't learned to trust God, he will bring us to a place of depth to train us to trust him no matter whats. God wants us to be prepared to trust him. He wants us to learn how to depend totally on him for everthing, completely surrendering to his will. Then comes the calm and rest.",

Jeremiah told them to be obedient and God would be with them and give them a hope and a future in the foreign godless country. So they went into exile and found it to be a godless nation. But God rose up mighty men of God like Daniel, Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego. And they shook that nation through their lives and testimony and God's Word spread through that nation through their testimony.

THIS method of questioning the person to be instructed is known to teachers as the Socratic method. Socrates was wont, not so much to state a fact, as to ask a question and draw out thoughts from those whom he taught. His method had long before been used by a far greater teacher. Putting questions is Jehovah's frequent method of instruction. When the Lord answered Job out of the whirlwind it was with a series of questions. \u201cKnowest thou the ordinances of heaven? canst thou set the dominion thereof in the earth? Canst thou lift up thy voice to the clouds, that abundance of waters may cover thee? Canst thou send lightnings, that they may go, and say unto thee, Here we are?\u201d and so forth. Questions from the Lord are very often the strongest affirmations. He would have us perceive their absolute certainty. They are put in this particular form because he would have us think over his great thought, and confirm it by our own reflections. The Lord shines upon us in the question, and our answer to it is the reflection of his light. The Infallible One challenges a contradiction, or even a doubt. \u201cIs anything too hard for me?\u201d is the strongest way of saying that nothing can be too hard for him...",

Here we see clearly the two possible ways that exist in life. Either a blessed or cursed life. There is no middle way. The man that is blessed prospers spiritually. He will bear fruit and his leaf will stay green, even in drought. We do not know our lives ahead. Difficult times might come, but if we are of this blessed kind, we will continue to bear sweet fruit and prosper. It is a great blessing if this life is your desire, and not on your lips only, but a reality in your life.

Salvation consists in knowing God.  How many, many people miss it!  How very, very few people in the world know God! You can tell it when you travel through the world and meet with works and ministers.  The great complaint is like it was by the prophet Jeremiah: the priests knew not the Lord.  How differently they would act and live and minister if they knew the Lord!  How different our conventions would turn out if those in charge knew the Lord!  But why don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t we know Him?  Jesus says, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Every one that seeketh findeth.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d  Findeth what?  Why, findeth God. Are we seeking God?  Are we really seeking God?  Then we shall find Him.  God says we shall find Him.  The very principle of faith is to start out with that knowledge: why, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153God is.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d  When you seek for something that you want very badly, you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re not going to give up until you find that thing.",

The serpent will not take us but rather we will take him up and whatever death the enemy has caused us to swallow it wiil not harm us. God will fill us with His power and His life will overflow with healing through us onto a sin sick world. These are the signs that will follow those who choose to believe.",

As Jeremiah says, it is \u201cThus saith THE LORD\u201d - not men - regarding what is essential in life; and what is essential is to know and to understand God. It is what we were created for. This is not a question of holding sound doctrine and orthodox truth. I want more than truth, he pleads; I want the REALITY of those truths in my life; deeply rooted, and springing forth into fruit unto the glory of God. This issue is not about doctrine, it is about the person of God; and in order to grow in sanctification, in zeal, in heart-felt emotion and love, we MUST have this personal knowledge of God; it is the source and motivation for all these things. The purpose of all truth is to bring us to the feet of Christ; and from there to the feet of everyone else, as servants; our boasting will then be not in what we know, but rather in what God is.

This biography is written by his son, who states in his preface that he has deliberately tried not to present his father's life through rose colored glasses but rather give a true and accurate account--warts and all. Those who have benefited from Huegel's other writings will welcome this unique chance to get a look at the man behind the books. Highly recommended!\r\nHe is the author of the book: \"Bone of His Bone\": One of the most basic principles for a successful life as a Christian is that the individual must experience full dependency on Jesus--allow Christ to become part of him.

The Youssef's came to America in 1977, and in 1978 Michael received a master's degree in theology at Fuller Theological Seminary in California and a Ph.D. from Emory University in social anthropology. Michael served for nearly ten years with the Haggai Institute, traveling around the world more than 32 times, teaching courses in evangelism and church leadership to church leaders. He rose to the position of Managing Director at the age of 31. The family settled in Atlanta, and in 1984, Michael became a United States citizen, fulfilling a dream he had held for many years.\r\nHe founded The Church of The Apostles in 1987 with fewer than 40 adults with the mission to \"Equip the Saints and Seek the Lost.\" The church has since grown to a congregation of over 3000. This church on a hill was the launching pad for Leading the Way's international ministry. While heard by millions at home and abroad, behind every message preached over the airwaves is a pastor's heart, longing to feed and care for people. Clearly God has uniquely equipped Dr. Youssef to speak to a worldwide audience. The path he has walked has given him a thorough cross-cultural understanding and a firm grasp of Scripture. He preaches, teaches and exhorts with a straightforward and uncompromising delivery, based on the authority of the inspired, infallible Word of God.

Was a British Methodist preacher who founded The Salvation Army and became its first General (1878\u20131912). The Christian movement with a quasi-military structure and government founded in 1865 has spread from London, England to many parts of the world and is known for being one of the largest distributors of humanitarian aid. Though Booth became a prominent Methodist evangelist, he was unhappy that the annual conference of the denomination kept assigning him to a pastorate, the duties of which he had to neglect to respond to the frequent requests that he do evangelistic campaigns. At the Liverpool conference in 1861, after having spent three years at Gateshead, his request to be freed for evangelism full-time was refused yet again, and Booth resigned from the ministry of the Methodist New Connexion.\r\n\r\nThe name The Salvation Army developed from an incident in May 1878. William Booth was dictating a letter to his secretary George Scott Railton and said, \"We are a volunteer army.\" Bramwell Booth heard his father and said, \"Volunteer, I'm no volunteer, I'm a regular!\" Railton was instructed to cross out the word \"volunteer\" and substitute the word \"salvation\". The Salvation Army was modelled after the military, with its own flag (or colours) and its own music, often with Christian words to popular and folkloric tunes sung in the pubs. Booth and the other soldiers in \"God's Army\" would wear the Army's own uniform, 'putting on the armour,' for meetings and ministry work. He became the \"General\" and his other ministers were given appropriate ranks as \"officers\". Other members became \"soldiers\".",

God blessed and grew the brooklyn tabernacle to a large church of thousands because of this reliance.\r\n\r\nThe burden of his ministry is to show the vital need for prayer, deependence on God and that God uses the weak and lowly to build His kingdom. He has written many books including the best-selling: \"Fresh Wind, Fresh Fire\" and his newer book \"Spirit Rising\" speaking of the neglected work of the Holy Spirit in our churches these days.",

Yohannan, the Metropolitan Bishop of Believers Church, was born and brought up in Niranam, Kerala. Niranam has immense historical significance in the tradition of Saint Thomas, a disciple of Jesus Christ who planted the first church there in AD 52.  K.P. Yohannan dedicated his life to God at a young age to serve the needy and downtrodden. He prayed, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Oh my Lord, let my heart break with the things that break Your heart\u00e2\u20ac\u009d and his life was never the same. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s his belief that one can only demonstrate God\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s love by loving people. After over four decades of selfless service, he says, I have no regrets in praying that prayer for I know God has touched millions through what He did in and through me. It is all God\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s grace.\r\n\r\nHe spent the early years of his service in North India and traveled to the remote villages sharing the love of Christ and doing charitable works. Through numerous encounters during those years, he was instilled with an increasing passion to bring hope, peace, and comfort to the needy and deprived. His sacrificial commitment, farsightedness and aptitude to perceive helped him to lead a life of unhindered devotion to serve Christ and His church. K.P. Yohannan is also the voice of Athmeeya Yathra, touching millions through his daily radio and TV broadcasts. His 250 books offer practical and spiritual guidance on hundreds of subjects.",
