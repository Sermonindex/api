            "description": "Daniel 9 is one of the most incredible prophecies in the whole of the Bible because of it's accuracy in fulfillment, Daniel in this passge is reading his Bible, specifically Jeremiah, he reads about how the people of Israel will go into captivity for 70 years and realises he is living in the fullfilment of that prophecy, Daniel believed the Bible literally and thus the 70 years he read about in the book of Jeremiah he believed was 70 years in reality.  Daniel is moved by what he reads and begins to intercede for the his people, he prays that the Lord would take this 70 years from the first move into captivity in 605BC and not 597BC.  Daniel was the 'chief of staff' for Babylon and still had time to pray in this incredible way, he set his face to seek the Lord and begn to repent for the sins of Israel and he begged the Lord to turn away His anger from His people and for the sake of His own righteousness restore His people.  The Lord answered Daniel's prayer.",

Jesus weeps over externalism, looking to Him in a lighthearted way, worldliness, mixture, and prejudice.  He comes to flip over everything in our lives that is not Christ, then He can begin to teach us.",

This urgent message is a Biblical exposition of salvation and regeneration, which also defends both the honour of God and the unity of the true church. Men and women are going to hell for want of the preaching of this message, he says. It's no wonder, then, that he speaks with such passion.  (96 minutes)",

To bring maximum glory to His Name the Lord is assembling an end times movement of weak, poor, helpless, and despised people who the religious system of our day have written off as unusable for their purposes.",

And there are other tears, too, which are the evidences not of weakness, but of might \u2014 the tears of tender sympathy are the children of strong affection, and they are strong like their parents. He that loves much, must weep much. The unfeeling heart, the unloving spirit, may pass from earth's portal to its utmost bound almost without a sigh except for itself; but he that loves, has dug as many wells of tears as he has chosen objects of affection; for by as many as our friends are multiplied, by so many must our griefs be multiplied too, if we have love enough to share in their griefs and to bear their burden for them.

Often times it may well just be one area that remains but nonetheless folks continue in that sin.  Wilkerson preaches a very personal message here and he shares his heart and shows his own weakness as an example.  The consequences for a Christian continuing in sin are sobering, but he gave us what we needed to overcome sin, if we want to. For those who are sick of their sin, and hate it, and cry out to God, there is wonderful news. He will empower you, and he wants to put his fear in your heart so you will not turn away from him, and then he can take you into the fullness of the new covenant. Powerful preaching, with a gentle compassion for those who are struggling.",

That he is able, faithful and willing to do what he said he would? If we do, then why don't we pray or believe like we should? Why do we not cast our cares on him and leave them there instead of picking them back up and trying to do it ourselves? Bro. Wilkerson examines the passage in Jer. 17:5 \"Cursed be the man who trusteth in flesh\".\u00a0 This is a very important message for all. True faith in God results in an abiding peace and rest in your soul. When we haven't learned to trust God, he will bring us to a place of depth to train us to trust him no matter whats. God wants us to be prepared to trust him. He wants us to learn how to depend totally on him for everthing, completely surrendering to his will. Then comes the calm and rest.",

At the time Jeremiah gave this word there were also other false prophets saying that it would go bad with them in exile. But they were false prophets. Jeremiah told them to be obedient and God would be with them and give them a hope and a future in the foreign godless country. So they went into exile and found it to be a godless nation. But God rose up mighty men of God like Daniel, Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego. And they shook that nation through their lives and testimony and God's Word spread through that nation through their testimony. Not that they didn't meet up with difficulties, but as they remained faithful to God He delivered them and through it glorified God.",

First, the voice of God will never promise us peace if we are embracing the same value system of the world. Second, the voice of God will challenge sin. In the dark days ahead the people of God will be lead into the tender mercies of God. God will give us a heart full of confidence when we choose to live uprightly.",

            "description": "DELIVERED ON LORD'S-DAY MORNING, APRIL 22ND, 1888, BY C. H. SPURGEON, AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON. \u201cThen came the word of the Lord unto Jeremiah, saying, Behold, I am the Lord, the God of all flesh: is there anything too hard for me?\u201d-Jeremiah 32:26, 27. THIS method of questioning the person to be instructed is known to teachers as the Socratic method. Socrates was wont, not so much to state a fact, as to ask a question and draw out thoughts from those whom he taught. His method had long before been used by a far greater teacher. Putting questions is Jehovah's frequent method of instruction. When the Lord answered Job out of the whirlwind it was with a series of questions. \u201cKnowest thou the ordinances of heaven? canst thou set the dominion thereof in the earth? Canst thou lift up thy voice to the clouds, that abundance of waters may cover thee? Canst thou send lightnings, that they may go, and say unto thee, Here we are?\u201d and so forth. Questions from the Lord are very often the strongest affirmations. He would have us perceive their absolute certainty. They are put in this particular form because he would have us think over his great thought, and confirm it by our own reflections. The Lord shines upon us in the question, and our answer to it is the reflection of his light. The Infallible One challenges a contradiction, or even a doubt. \u201cIs anything too hard for me?\u201d is the strongest way of saying that nothing can be too hard for him...",

Those whose God He is, they are blessed as well. This blessed man is contrasted with the man that is cursed, in the verses just before these. Here we see clearly the two possible ways that exist in life. Either a blessed or cursed life. There is no middle way. The man that is blessed prospers spiritually. He will bear fruit and his leaf will stay green, even in drought. We do not know our lives ahead. Difficult times might come, but if we are of this blessed kind, we will continue to bear sweet fruit and prosper. It is a great blessing if this life is your desire, and not on your lips only, but a reality in your life. The fruit of such a blessed person is love, joy, peace, longsuffering, gentleness, goodness, faith, etc.",

In spite of all those who are quitting the ministry, God is still raising up His Levitical Priesthood. There are two streams, 2 concurrent types of priesthoods. Ezekiel prophesied that in the last days there'll be two kinds of congregations, preachers and ministers. There will be those who minister unto God. In Ez 40-44, Ezekiel has the vision of a great temple that was to be built. That is not a physical temple, because it stretches over lands and seas and mountains. He is talking about the church of the last days. He sees the church as having no boundaries. And the glory of the Lord is coming down on that house\/temple.

In the second part, God promises that He will never lack ministers (Levites) to minister before Him. In spite of all those who are quitting the ministry, God is still raising up His Levitical Priesthood. There are two streams, 2 concurrent types of priesthoods. Ezekiel prophesied that in the last days there'll be two kinds of congregations, preachers and ministers. There will be those who minister unto God. In Ez 40-44, Ezekiel has the vision of a great temple that was to be built. That is not a physical temple, because it stretches over lands and seas and mountains. He is talking about the church of the last days. He sees the church as having no boundaries. And the glory of the Lord is coming down on that house\/temple. But Ezekiel saw a strange, horrifying sight. Despite the glory, a rebellious priesthood came forth. The Levitical priesthood were to guard and cleanse the gates of the tabernacle. Nothing evil was to be allowed into the temple.",

If you're asleep spiritually even a service where God is at work doesn't touch you, and you go out the same way you entered. The doer of sin is a slave of sin (John 8:34). May God wake us up. May we hear this promise from Jeremiah properly for it's a great promise in the Bible. God's plans for us is a good future. Hell was not made for people but for the devil and his angels. But if you cling to your sin then you too will end there. There are those who say they will never confess their sin to a person but such are asleep spiritually.",

How differently they would act and live and minister if they knew the Lord!  How different our conventions would turn out if those in charge knew the Lord!

God has intertwined His life with His church and it doesn\u2019t matter how far we have fallen we are never out of God's reach. Those who are in Christ will not be overcome by the enemy. The serpent will not take us but rather we will take him up and whatever death the enemy has caused us to swallow it wiil not harm us. God will fill us with His power and His life will overflow with healing through us onto a sin sick world. These are the signs that will follow those who choose to believe.",

As Jeremiah says, it is \u201cThus saith THE LORD\u201d - not men - regarding what is essential in life; and what is essential is to know and to understand God. It is what we were created for. This is not a question of holding sound doctrine and orthodox truth. I want more than truth, he pleads; I want the REALITY of those truths in my life; deeply rooted, and springing forth into fruit unto the glory of God. This issue is not about doctrine, it is about the person of God; and in order to grow in sanctification, in zeal, in heart-felt emotion and love, we MUST have this personal knowledge of God; it is the source and motivation for all these things. The purpose of all truth is to bring us to the feet of Christ; and from there to the feet of everyone else, as servants; our boasting will then be not in what we know, but rather in what God is.

False prophets are resisting Christ Himself for power, money and fame. Biblical prosperity is not given to bigger cars and houses. Biblical prosperity is to be poured out for lost humanity with the compassion and selflessness of Jesus Christ.",

When we lose sight of the promises of God we can't see our way out of spiritual depression. There is a deep compassion that is worked in us when we experience the valley of the shadow of death. Until we suffer we can't hear the cry of the suffering. We need the old time compassion of Christ and the old time burden for the lost. If we begin to thank God in the midst of our struggle Jesus Christ will be glorified.",
