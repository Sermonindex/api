It is a gospel of humanistic materialism that is infused with the spirit of covetousness. A covetous gospel that lusts after bigger cars, houses and bigger bank accounts. Everything Jesus taught lashes out against this gospel. The true gospel of Jesus Christ is burdened for the widows, the orphans and the hurting around the world",
