            "description": "There are some important things to consider before you answer the question. Do you really trust the Lord? That he is able, faithful and willing to do what he said he would? If we do, then why don't we pray or believe like we should? Why do we not cast our cares on him and leave them there instead of picking them back up and trying to do it ourselves? Bro. Wilkerson examines the passage in Jer. 17:5 \"Cursed be the man who trusteth in flesh\".\u00a0 This is a very important message for all. True faith in God results in an abiding peace and rest in your soul. When we haven't learned to trust God, he will bring us to a place of depth to train us to trust him no matter whats. God wants us to be prepared to trust him. He wants us to learn how to depend totally on him for everthing, completely surrendering to his will. Then comes the calm and rest.",

            "description": "A life that has God's blessing, is truly a blessed life. God is a blessed God. We read numerous times in the Bible phrases such as \"blessed be the Lord God ...\". Those whose God He is, they are blessed as well. This blessed man is contrasted with the man that is cursed, in the verses just before these. Here we see clearly the two possible ways that exist in life. Either a blessed or cursed life. There is no middle way. The man that is blessed prospers spiritually. He will bear fruit and his leaf will stay green, even in drought. We do not know our lives ahead. Difficult times might come, but if we are of this blessed kind, we will continue to bear sweet fruit and prosper. It is a great blessing if this life is your desire, and not on your lips only, but a reality in your life. The fruit of such a blessed person is love, joy, peace, longsuffering, gentleness, goodness, faith, etc.",
