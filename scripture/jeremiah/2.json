It was a group of meetings with some of the leading revivalists alive at the time. Men like Leonard Ravenhill, Bill McCloud, Josef Tson, and others. These are men who influenced my life through their preaching and writing and here they were all in one place. They had individual sessions where they talked about revival and were interviewed in order to give their testimony of faith in Christ. And there was a panel discussion where as a group they discussed true revival and the church in America.\r\nThis is a very powerful series of meetings and testimonies of genuine biblical revival. It would do well for many pastors and God's servants to watch these videos and hear the audio sermons of then men from the Past.",

In fact, Christians can see some striking parallels between modern America and Israel and Judah before they were taken captive centuries ago. Perhaps no passage of Scripture speaks to our nation more directly than Jeremiah 2. It is a powerful warning  of impending judgement, and a call to national repentance.",
