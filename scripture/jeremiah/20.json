            "description": "March 14, 2004 - What a wonderful thing when God touches a man a puts a call on our lives. When we walk in obedience all the demons of hell can\u2019t stand against us. A fire will burn in us to walk out our calling. God allows twisted situations in our lives of being hurt and misunderstood and we must prevail against our enemies through the faithfulness of Jesus. God understands our pain and He will instill us a faith in that fire that can\u2019t be shaken. Preaching from the book of Jeremiah, Wilkerson preaches on a popular passage of Scripture.  Wilkerson puts out a Watchman\u2019s call, giving us that unction to preach the gospel with the proper zeal, understanding the calling of God.",

            "description": "Jeremiah was called of God and knew the call on his life more than any other prophet in the Old Testament. Before he was made in the womb, he was known of God. He was anointed to speak the mind of God. God made him this promise. \"I have made you a defensed, impregnable city, against the priests and all the people. They will fight against you, but will not prevail.\" Then, these amazing words. \"Speak, lest I confound you before the people\". No man was more sure of his calling, and God called him to speak of destruction and desolation, but if he should doubt, he shall be confounded. I.e. If you trust me you will never be confounded, but if you will doubt your call from Me, I'll confound you before men. This is crucial in today's world. I have been preaching for over 50 years, but still remember the day, time and place where God called me. I have never once doubted that call. If a person cannot say to God, \"I'm in your will and your place\", then you will be confounded.",
