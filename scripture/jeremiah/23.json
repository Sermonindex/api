The greatest malady in the Church today is the lack of the fear of God. May we examine ourselves to see if we are in the faith and the faith that is truly rooted in God's Word!",

The Church has sinned, we have sinned, not living and \"doing\" the word of God.  American true Christians are officially classified with extremists in the class of terrorists by the FBI and Homeland Security in the USA. True Christians love their enemies and do good yet we are starting to be hated. Jesus said this would happen. America and Canada are killing the unborn on an altar of lust. It is the greatest genocide in human history.",

Rather than Israel\u2019s leaders being a means of blessing, they were instead a means of judgment. But the God of the universe would not allow his agenda to be highjacked by ungodly leaders. God promised that he would send a Someone to lead His people, raising up a righteous Branch who would reign as a wise king. Who is this Person? You don\u2019t have to search far to find out who this Someone is: Jesus of Nazareth.",

False prophets are resisting Christ Himself for power, money and fame. Biblical prosperity is not given to bigger cars and houses. Biblical prosperity is to be poured out for lost humanity with the compassion and selflessness of Jesus Christ.",
