            "description": "Daniel 9 is one of the most incredible prophecies in the whole of the Bible because of it's accuracy in fulfillment, Daniel in this passge is reading his Bible, specifically Jeremiah, he reads about how the people of Israel will go into captivity for 70 years and realises he is living in the fullfilment of that prophecy, Daniel believed the Bible literally and thus the 70 years he read about in the book of Jeremiah he believed was 70 years in reality.  Daniel is moved by what he reads and begins to intercede for the his people, he prays that the Lord would take this 70 years from the first move into captivity in 605BC and not 597BC.  Daniel was the 'chief of staff' for Babylon and still had time to pray in this incredible way, he set his face to seek the Lord and begn to repent for the sins of Israel and he begged the Lord to turn away His anger from His people and for the sake of His own righteousness restore His people.  The Lord answered Daniel's prayer.",

            "description": "\"Righteousness exalts a nation; but sin is a reproach to any people.\" Proverbs 14:34. As a nation we have in large scale rejected the true and living God and have abandoned our godly heritage and the special light that came through mighty preachers in the past and formerly pious church denominations and have gone headlong into decadent humanism, deceptive liberalism, demonic occultism and a weak, man-centered, flesh-pleasing, fad-conforming evangelicalism. By doing so we have incurred a dreadful accountability as a nation before God. As a nation we must repent and plead for God to have mercy upon us.",
