            "description": "Daniel 9 is one of the most incredible prophecies in the whole of the Bible because of it's accuracy in fulfillment, Daniel in this passge is reading his Bible, specifically Jeremiah, he reads about how the people of Israel will go into captivity for 70 years and realises he is living in the fullfilment of that prophecy, Daniel believed the Bible literally and thus the 70 years he read about in the book of Jeremiah he believed was 70 years in reality.  Daniel is moved by what he reads and begins to intercede for the his people, he prays that the Lord would take this 70 years from the first move into captivity in 605BC and not 597BC.  Daniel was the 'chief of staff' for Babylon and still had time to pray in this incredible way, he set his face to seek the Lord and begn to repent for the sins of Israel and he begged the Lord to turn away His anger from His people and for the sake of His own righteousness restore His people.  The Lord answered Daniel's prayer.",

At the time Jeremiah gave this word there were also other false prophets saying that it would go bad with them in exile. But they were false prophets. Jeremiah told them to be obedient and God would be with them and give them a hope and a future in the foreign godless country. So they went into exile and found it to be a godless nation. But God rose up mighty men of God like Daniel, Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego. And they shook that nation through their lives and testimony and God's Word spread through that nation through their testimony. Not that they didn't meet up with difficulties, but as they remained faithful to God He delivered them and through it glorified God.",

In these last days demonic voices will arise to deceive us and lead us into captivity. How can we know when God is speaking to us? First, the voice of God will never promise us peace if we are embracing the same value system of the world. Second, the voice of God will challenge sin. In the dark days ahead the people of God will be lead into the tender mercies of God. God will give us a heart full of confidence when we choose to live uprightly.",

How differently they would act and live and minister if they knew the Lord!  How different our conventions would turn out if those in charge knew the Lord!  But why don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t we know Him?  Jesus says, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Every one that seeketh findeth.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d  Findeth what?  Why, findeth God. Are we seeking God?  Are we really seeking God?  Then we shall find Him.  God says we shall find Him.
