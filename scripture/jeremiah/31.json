Rather all creation \"groans\" under the burden of sin and we are lost because of it. In spite of that, however, God's voice constantly calls us to come to Him -- to rest in the safety of His sheltering arms. Dr. Tozer tells of a God who so loves His creation so much that He offers both love and hope, even though we are hopelessly lost.",

He sought for God's honor with the zeal of Elijah and mourned with Jeremiah at the apostasy of God's people. \r\n\r\nLeonard Ravenhill was a close friend of pastor and writer A. W. Tozer and spoke of him as one of the most influential voices in the Church in America. A.W. Tozer's materials are a mainstay in Evangelical churches in our day and he is one of the most quoted authors. He was a prophet in his day and his writings are even more influential in our day.
