            "description": "Why do believers continue in sin?  Year after year after year they continue in some sort of sin and they never come into the fullness of the Covenant blessing of God.  Often times it may well just be one area that remains but nonetheless folks continue in that sin.  Wilkerson preaches a very personal message here and he shares his heart and shows his own weakness as an example.  The consequences for a Christian continuing in sin are sobering, but he gave us what we needed to overcome sin, if we want to. For those who are sick of their sin, and hate it, and cry out to God, there is wonderful news. He will empower you, and he wants to put his fear in your heart so you will not turn away from him, and then he can take you into the fullness of the new covenant. Powerful preaching, with a gentle compassion for those who are struggling.",

            "description": "DELIVERED ON LORD'S-DAY MORNING, APRIL 22ND, 1888, BY C. H. SPURGEON, AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON. \u201cThen came the word of the Lord unto Jeremiah, saying, Behold, I am the Lord, the God of all flesh: is there anything too hard for me?\u201d-Jeremiah 32:26, 27. THIS method of questioning the person to be instructed is known to teachers as the Socratic method. Socrates was wont, not so much to state a fact, as to ask a question and draw out thoughts from those whom he taught. His method had long before been used by a far greater teacher. Putting questions is Jehovah's frequent method of instruction. When the Lord answered Job out of the whirlwind it was with a series of questions. \u201cKnowest thou the ordinances of heaven? canst thou set the dominion thereof in the earth? Canst thou lift up thy voice to the clouds, that abundance of waters may cover thee? Canst thou send lightnings, that they may go, and say unto thee, Here we are?\u201d and so forth. Questions from the Lord are very often the strongest affirmations. He would have us perceive their absolute certainty. They are put in this particular form because he would have us think over his great thought, and confirm it by our own reflections. The Lord shines upon us in the question, and our answer to it is the reflection of his light. The Infallible One challenges a contradiction, or even a doubt. \u201cIs anything too hard for me?\u201d is the strongest way of saying that nothing can be too hard for him...",
