Pastor Chuck was used in the Jesus People revival where he was used along with others to minister to the hippy young people. They saw a work of the Spirit where many were added to the church and discipled. He has raised up many pastors who are a part of the Calvary Chapel movement now and where he pastors the large Costa Mesa church in California.\r\n\r\nThe Calvary Chapel movement is based of simple principles that Chuck Smith taught over the years such as: The priority of agape love, Simple fellowship amongst the saints, the breaking of bread, the teaching of God's word chapter by chapter and verse by verse. And lastly and most importantly the principle not by might nor by power but by my spirit saith the Lord.",

He is talking about the church of the last days. He sees the church as having no boundaries. And the glory of the Lord is coming down on that house\/temple. But Ezekiel saw a strange, horrifying sight. Despite the glory, a rebellious priesthood came forth. The Levitical priesthood were to guard and cleanse the gates of the tabernacle.

Heugel believes that intercession is the greatest of all ministries, backing up his assertion with Scripture and example, both historical and personal.  He recounted the flame of intercession of the Moravians from which dawned the great movement of worldwide missions and strengthened his position upon great answers to prayer in the lives of Hudson Taylor, C. T. Studd and others.  (Part 1: The Laws of Prayer \/ Part 2: The Ministry of Prayer \/ Part 3: Great Prayers of History)",

Was a chaplain in WWI and a missionary in Mexico. He wrote many books that are worth reading. Huegel's writings on the deeper aspects of Christ's work on Calvary and it's implications for the believer have blessed multitudes of Christians. This biography is written by his son, who states in his preface that he has deliberately tried not to present his father's life through rose colored glasses but rather give a true and accurate account--warts and all. Those who have benefited from Huegel's other writings will welcome this unique chance to get a look at the man behind the books. Highly recommended!\r\nHe is the author of the book: \"Bone of His Bone\": One of the most basic principles for a successful life as a Christian is that the individual must experience full dependency on Jesus--allow Christ to become part of him. In effect he must become Bone of His Bone. Don't miss these freshly edited studies on the indwelling Christ.",
