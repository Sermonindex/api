Pastor Chuck was used in the Jesus People revival where he was used along with others to minister to the hippy young people. They saw a work of the Spirit where many were added to the church and discipled. He has raised up many pastors who are a part of the Calvary Chapel movement now and where he pastors the large Costa Mesa church in California.\r\n\r\nThe Calvary Chapel movement is based of simple principles that Chuck Smith taught over the years such as: The priority of agape love, Simple fellowship amongst the saints, the breaking of bread, the teaching of God's word chapter by chapter and verse by verse. And lastly and most importantly the principle not by might nor by power but by my spirit saith the Lord.",

            "description": "August 24, 2008 - Have you ever been in a situation that was so perplexing where you knew that God was able to deliver you but nothing happened? When we lose sight of the promises of God we can't see our way out of spiritual depression. There is a deep compassion that is worked in us when we experience the valley of the shadow of death. Until we suffer we can't hear the cry of the suffering. We need the old time compassion of Christ and the old time burden for the lost. If we begin to thank God in the midst of our struggle Jesus Christ will be glorified.",
