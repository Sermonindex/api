Worldliness has prevailed in the Church and no power of the Spirit present. There is a time needed of great repentance for the Church of God.",

God will either pour out His blessings in revival to defend His holy Name, or He will pour out His wrath upon mankind to avenge His holy Name. It will either be a defending or avenging to show forth His glory and remind mankind He alone is the Sovereign ruler of all.\"",

Circumcise yourselves to the LORD, and take away the foreskins of your hearts because your doings are evil. The Church is heading in the wrong direction. The wills of those within it are revolting against God. Do not be deceived by outward professions! Those who bear the good fruit of holy living are the true Church of Jesus Christ. Many religious leaders have risen up and prophesied falsely, but the people love to have it so. These false shepherds cannot be trusted. Repent! Be deceived no longer! What will you do in the end?",
