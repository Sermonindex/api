            "description": "Ed offers 4 observations to aid in understanding this second cleansing of the temple, such as seeing it in light of Jeremiah 7, contrasting the outer glory with the inner corruption, and studying the background of the convenience animals.  Jesus weeps over externalism, looking to Him in a lighthearted way, worldliness, mixture, and prejudice.  He comes to flip over everything in our lives that is not Christ, then He can begin to teach us.",

Without the guidance of the Holy Spirit men have been making up entire systems of beliefs with theological words that are used blasphemously and do not represent the truth nor the heart of God. We are then misled to believe that such humanistic doctrines carry \u00e2\u20ac\u0153life.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d Life is not found in a theological system or interpretation; Life is found in Christ Jesus, surrendering to Him and allowing Him to live His Life through us. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s what it means to be \u00e2\u20ac\u0153born again\u00e2\u20ac\u009d or \u00e2\u20ac\u0153born of the Spirit.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d",
