            "description": "Ed offers 4 observations to aid in understanding this second cleansing of the temple, such as seeing it in light of Jeremiah 7, contrasting the outer glory with the inner corruption, and studying the background of the convenience animals.  Jesus weeps over externalism, looking to Him in a lighthearted way, worldliness, mixture, and prejudice.  He comes to flip over everything in our lives that is not Christ, then He can begin to teach us.",

We are then misled to believe that such humanistic doctrines carry \u00e2\u20ac\u0153life.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d Life is not found in a theological system or interpretation; Life is found in Christ Jesus, surrendering to Him and allowing Him to live His Life through us.
