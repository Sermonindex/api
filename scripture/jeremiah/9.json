By emphasizing Paul\u2019s burden and heart wrenching desire for Israel, Dr. Brown shares both the closeness and hardness of Israel and reveals the need for a broken heart over all men.",

            "description": "It is no sign of weakness when a man weeps for sin, it shows that he has strength of mind; yes more, that he has strength imparted by God, which enables him to forswear his lusts and overcome his passions, and to turn unto God with full purpose of heart. And there are other tears, too, which are the evidences not of weakness, but of might \u2014 the tears of tender sympathy are the children of strong affection, and they are strong like their parents. He that loves much, must weep much. The unfeeling heart, the unloving spirit, may pass from earth's portal to its utmost bound almost without a sigh except for itself; but he that loves, has dug as many wells of tears as he has chosen objects of affection; for by as many as our friends are multiplied, by so many must our griefs be multiplied too, if we have love enough to share in their griefs and to bear their burden for them. It needs a mighty prophet like Jeremiah to weep as mightily as he. May we have more weeping in our churches.",

As Jeremiah says, it is \u201cThus saith THE LORD\u201d - not men - regarding what is essential in life; and what is essential is to know and to understand God. It is what we were created for. This is not a question of holding sound doctrine and orthodox truth. I want more than truth, he pleads; I want the REALITY of those truths in my life; deeply rooted, and springing forth into fruit unto the glory of God. This issue is not about doctrine, it is about the person of God; and in order to grow in sanctification, in zeal, in heart-felt emotion and love, we MUST have this personal knowledge of God; it is the source and motivation for all these things. The purpose of all truth is to bring us to the feet of Christ; and from there to the feet of everyone else, as servants; our boasting will then be not in what we know, but rather in what God is.
