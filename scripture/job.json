Some look at the Crystal and say it is green, and others say \"no its red.\"  But the mature one walks around the Crystal and says \"your both right\" It is the same with the gospel in the scriptures.  There are many different ingredients that make up the recipe of the gospel.  This series attempts to show all the ingredients of the gospel.  This is important because if our recipe is different than Gods, then we will not get the same result found in the book of Acts.",

A person is known by his friends. Look at who your friends are, then you know who you are.

As the book deals with the problem of suffering, we see what is actually happening in the heavenly realm.  Zac shows how a true godly man will be misunderstood, experience loneliness and have a pathway of suffering, yet enjoys God's protection (the hedge), freedom from seeking men's honor and is a worshipper.",

            "description": "In this insightful lesson, Zac shows the four types of preachers today in Christendom.  Can you see yourself in Zophar, the self-appointed prophet, or Eliphaz, the one who tries to lend weight to his words by supernatural happenings, or Elihu, the man with the right knowledge by no experience of deep suffering?  The fifth preacher, who brought Job to repentance, was God, who loved him and that was what made all the difference.",

God's heart is set on His church, in spite if all the apostasy and false teachers, He will not allow the Cross of Jesus Christ to be in vain. The Lord is calling us to complete confidence in the remission of sins. God's plan for us is not to walk in guilt and condemnation, He is calling us to enjoy Jesus and trust in the Power of the Blood of Jesus. When we embrace this we will come into truly find rest in Jesus.",
