            "description": "A brief series of four messages addressing the moral condition of our nation in a focused way. The first message deals with the relationship of God to all the nations, including our own. In this introductory message we see: 1. the subjugation of all the nations to the sovereign rule of God. 2. the accountability of the nations to the just judgment of God. 3. the responsibility of the nations to hear the word of God.  4. the solidarity of believers with the nation in which they are found. Subsequent messages address more pointedly our nations\u2019 sins of bloodguiltiness, sexual perversion and religious apostasy.",
