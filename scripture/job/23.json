The pastor discusses the end of the world, the end of civilization, the difference between the two, why so many accuse Jesus of failing to keep a promise of world peace, and why they are wrong. \u201cThey create a Christianity of their own, and then they try to make Christ conform to their own, homemade Christianity. \u2026 It may surprise some of you to know that our Lord Jesus Christ never promised peace\u2014world peace, peace among the nations\u2014during this age.\u201d Christians shouldn\u2019t blame the church, either. Dr. Tozer addresses a range of other vital issues including the state of Israel in this excellent sermon, reading from Job 23:6, Psalm 85:8, and Matthew 24:4-14. ***Note: Both parts of this message can also be downloaded as one single sermon that is listed on sermonindex.net under the title, \u201cThe New Year As God Sees It.\u201d",
