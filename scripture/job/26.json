            "description": "Man commonly focus on the parts rather than the whole. As such, there is a tendency for Christians to over-emphasize a particular truth rather than the whole counsel of God. All these truths are found in the Person of the Lord Jesus Christ. The thing that sets us apart from the world is the Presence of God in our midst, and it is His Presence that we should seek after. Let it not be said of us as it is in Job 26:14 that \"these are parts of his ways: but how little a portion is heard of him?\"",
