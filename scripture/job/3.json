Can you see yourself in Zophar, the self-appointed prophet, or Eliphaz, the one who tries to lend weight to his words by supernatural happenings, or Elihu, the man with the right knowledge by no experience of deep suffering?  The fifth preacher, who brought Job to repentance, was God, who loved him and that was what made all the difference.",
