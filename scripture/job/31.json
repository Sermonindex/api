            "description": "Every Christian should have made a covenant with his eyes not even to look upon temptation. Some temptations only need a spark before it brings forth sin. Remember Job who made a covenant with his eyes not even to look upon a young girl, a virgin (Job 31:1). Why would you live among sinners and those who are corrupt in word and deed. A person is known by his friends. Look at who your friends are, then you know who you are. In Ps 1 we read that \"blessed is the man who walk not after the counsel of the ungodly, nor stand in the way of sinners, nor sit in the seat of the scornful\".",
