Some look at the Crystal and say it is green, and others say \"no its red.\"  But the mature one walks around the Crystal and says \"your both right\" It is the same with the gospel in the scriptures.  There are many different ingredients that make up the recipe of the gospel.  This series attempts to show all the ingredients of the gospel.  This is important because if our recipe is different than Gods, then we will not get the same result found in the book of Acts.",

Was a Christian missionary, teacher, writer, and advocate of economic development in impoverished nations. A spiritual crisis during this period\u2014as he described two decades later in what is probably his best-known recorded teaching, \"Ten Shekels and a Shirt\"--left Reidhead with the conviction that much of evangelicalism had adopted utilitarian and humanistic philosophies contradictory to Biblical teaching. The end of all being, he came to believe, was not the happiness of man, but the glorification of God. This theme would recur throughout his later teaching.\r\n\r\nSince Mr. Reidhead's death in 1992, Bible Teaching Ministries, Inc. continues under the leadership of his wife, Marjorie, and daughter, Virginia Teitt, a dedicated Board, and the many people who have donated time and talent after being changed by God\u2019s Word through this message. The message of the Gospel is reaching an ever-widening audience all over the world.",
