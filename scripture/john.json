Today Jesus stands and cries out the same words to a church that has no the prophetic word and no manifest presence of the Spirit. Verse 39 explains why: \"the Holy Ghost was not yet given; because that Jesus was not yet glorified.\" The Holy Spirit is not given when Jesus is not glorified and His Lordship not recognized. The baptism of the Holy Spirit is the coronation of the Lord Jesus in the heart of the believer. Revival is the coronation of the Lord Jesus in His church.",

He also goes on to clarify the difference between the goats, the saved sheep, and the lost sheep. \"The Lord never made a sheep out of a goat yet. A goat is a goat and will be a goat till he dies.\" Tozer talks of his own pagan upbringing; how one night he came to know that he was \"Jesus' little boy\" and of his conversion seven years later - he was a lost sheep hearing a voice.",

At the charcoal fire (a reminder of Peter's betrayal), the Lord teaches us we can dine with Him no matter how messed up our past has been.  In the fifth detailed appearance Luke pointed out Christ's hands outstretched as the high priest giving the benediction; right now His hands are in blessing toward you.",

This is not only a tragedy but one of Satan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tactics323 to hinder the growth of the true Church of Jesus Christ.

Their cry to go and make new disciples is backed up with their very lives. In many cases if they speak to the wrong person about Jesus, they face prison, torture and even death. The task of sharing the Gospel is for every Christian, even if they give their life as a martyr. Chinese Christians teach us that when their seed (their life) has gone into the ground and died it will multiply and produce much more fruit.544 With their blood new growth is coming. The seed, their body that died now produces 100 fold, 1000 fold or even more.",

Jesus prayed in the garden to His Father; \u00e2\u20ac\u0153that all of them may be one, Father, just as You are in Me and I am in You. May they also be in Us so that the world may believe that You have sent Me.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d1037 Jesus gives the purpose for love in the body of Christ: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153That the world might believe!\u00e2\u20ac\u009d Jesus gave a very specific commandment in John 15: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153My command is this: Love each other as I have loved you. Greater love has no one than this: to lay down one\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s life for one\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s friends.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d1038 In John 13, Jesus said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153A new command I give you: Love one another. As I have loved you, so you must love one another. By this everyone will know that you are My disciples, if you love one another.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d",

IN the first part of my discourse this morning I shall strictly keep to my text, as the words of our Lord Jesus Christ, and endeavor to show what it teaches us with regard to him. These are his own words, and it would be robbery to borrow them until first we have seen what they meant as they fell from his lips. Their most golden meaning must be seen in the light of his sacred countenance. Then, in the second part of my sermon, I shall try to point out how the petition before us may be used by ourselves, and I pray that divine grace may be given us that it may be engraven upon our hearts, and that each one of us may be taught by the Holy Spirit daily to say for himself, \u201cFather, glorify thy name.\u201d I would suggest That these words should be to all the Lord's people in this church their motto for another year, and, indeed, their prayer throughout life. It will as well beseem the beginner in grace as the ripe believer; it will be proper both at the wicket-gate of faith, and at the portals of glory. Like a lovely rainbow let the prayer, \u201cFather, glorify thy name,\u201d over-arch the whole period of our life on earth. I cannot suggest a better petition for the present moment, nor indeed for any moment of our pilgrimage. Let us close the old year with it, and open the door of the new to the same note.",

It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s this: that we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re learning, slowly, to abandon ourselves. Now, a person, of course, can abandon himself to sin\u00e2\u20ac\u201dto flesh, to lust, to pride, to sensitiveness, to all the works of the flesh.  But the wonderful thing is that we have learned\u00e2\u20ac\u201dor are learning\u00e2\u20ac\u201dto abandon ourselves to Jesus, or \u00e2\u20ac\u0153wholly give ourselves to One who gives Himself to us\u00e2\u20ac\u009d.",

In the coming days many will experience intense sorrow as our image of God and our own image of how we think Christ should be glorified through us will suddenly be taken away from us. Things that we thought we were going to be in Christ and things that we thought God was obligated to do through us will suddenly be shaken. God in His mercy will shake everything that can be shaken so we can gain a right perspective of who He is and who we are in Christ! God will shake it all until all worldly security is gone and there is nothing left in His church but Christ Himself!",

And when you come there\u00e2\u20ac\u201dI\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve been there twice myself\u00e2\u20ac\u201dyou find nothing like you find here, right in this room.

He is seeking men and women who worship Him \u00e2\u20ac\u0153in spirit and in truth.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d  And in order to create such men and women, the Lord Jesus Christ has offered us a great and wonderful gift here.

He discusses in depth John 14:3. The \u201chouse\u201d referred to in the phrase \u201cIn My Father\u2019s House\u2026\u201d is not Heaven, but Jesus Himself \u2013 Jesus is the house of God. Not that Heaven does not exist, but it is not the goal. Jesus is the Father\u2019s house, and He makes a place in Himself for us, so that we become a room in that house.

Suddenly Jesus was among them saying, \"Peace be with you\". Jesus needs no key to enter the room. Even if there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no door, He can go right through the wall. Then He showed them His hands and feet. You\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve heard how his majesty said unashamedly that Jesus is His Lord before the whole world. Jesus said that he who is ashamed of Me, of him I will be ashamed before the Father and His holy angels (Luke 9:26). A certain very prominent judge in Germany has said that if all the evidence and witnesses in the Bible be judged in a court of law, the verdict would be clear that indeed Jesus had risen from the dead! If you refuse to believe after all the evidence had been laid out before you, no wonder that your condemnation in hell will be just.",

            "description": "Before the revival I was troubled, for I would go around holding services and many would repent. But after 2 or 3 years when I return to visit them again I would find the Christians in disunity. But we read in Acts how the early Christians were of one heart and soul (Acts 4:32). But what I found among the Christians were in opposition to this, the one would criticize the next; the other would complain that they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re not treated well or greeted properly. I knew that revival wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t start if things didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t come right among the Christians first, for the Bible says that judgment must begin in the house of God (1Pet 4:17). The reason the Word of God, the Bible, doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t cover the earth, is not because of the heathen, but because of the Christians that aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t living according to the Word of God. Jesus said that the one who believes in Him as the Scripture has said, from his innermost being will flow rivers of Living Waters. Rivers of water cannot be stopped. You might try to stop a river by building a restraining wall in the river, but the water will only build up on the one side and eventually break the wall in a massive flood, or the water will rise up and flow over the wall.",

If you are then you're going to change your praying. Instead of saying, initially, 'Lord, save Him,' you're going to say, 'Lord, slay him. Bring him to the awareness of his desperate plight.

Wilkerson explains how our Lord wants us after we offer up our praise, prayers and petitions, to wait in his presence so he can in return speak to us. To lay hold of the truth in this message, in Luke 17:7-10, the parable of the Lord instructing his servant who's just come in from his labors to gird himself and serve his Lord, and then he may eat is clearly expounded in a way that will excite and transform your prayer life. This gives an exciting expectancy to the scripture \"Wait upon the Lord and he will renew your strength.\" It is humbling to know our Lord is hungry for fellowship with his children.",

As you behold the mercy of God and the promises of God you will be changed into a new person. God longs to give you something deeper than a casual relationship.

That is why Hell will be so tormenting. Many who refuse Christ now will come face to face with Jesus later only to find their opportunity for has passed them by! We are living in an amazing day of grace and the greatest news you can hear is that you can reach out and touch God for yourself.

In these last days demonic voices will arise to deceive us and lead us into captivity. How can we know when God is speaking to us? First, the voice of God will never promise us peace if we are embracing the same value system of the world. Second, the voice of God will challenge sin. In the dark days ahead the people of God will be lead into the tender mercies of God. God will give us a heart full of confidence when we choose to live uprightly.",

From John 3:16, Matthew 20:28, Acts 20:35, he asks us to note four truths: 1) the father gave his Son, 2) the Son gave his life, 3) they did so in order that we might be ransomed, and 4) it is more blessed to give than to receive. Dr. Tozer then considers who we might want to thank some day for the gifts that they gave to Jesus. The wise men gave gold (lasting treasure), frankincense (worship), and myrrh (bitter sacrifice); Mary gave her mortal body; Joseph gave his faith; the shepherds gave their reverent wonder; Lazarus and his sisters, Mary and Martha, gave the welcome of their home; the women following Jesus gave a seamless, linen robe; and Joseph of Arimathaea gave his own, new grave. These are the gifts that they gave to Jesus. What might we give him that we might not be outdone in giving?",

God doesn\u2019t need us, but He wants us. Though man possesses a natural desire to worship, he wishes to worship any way he feels like worshiping. The God who wants us to worship Him, however, has decreed how we are to do so. Pastor Tozer details three kinds of worship that God outrightly rejects: 1) \u201cCain worship:\u201d worship without atonement. 2) \u201cSamaritan worship:\u201d accepting what one wants to believe, neglecting what one doesn\u2019t, and adding what\u2019s not there at all. 3) \u201cNature worship:\u201d mistaking worship of God\u2019s creation for worship of God himself. John 4:24 describes the kind of worship that God gladly accepts. Psalm 45:11 and 2 Thessalonians 1:10 are also texts for this 39-minute sermon.",

If we don't abide in him, we will wither and die on the vine, and be cut off, bundled up and cast away. Repeatedly, Jesus warned his disciples against unbelief. He is all we need and he has all we need no matter what happens. You can't enter into the rest of Christ until you understand your position in him. Just because you fail doesn't mean you drop off the vine. Wonderful message of assurance.",

I repeat that when God made the heaven and earth, they sang together and all the sons of God shouted for joy! There wasn\u2019t a funeral at the creation of the world; there was an anthem, and all the creature creations sang! And at the incarnation they sang!\u201d There was singing at the resurrection and we\u2019ll sing at the rapture and the consummation, and the song will be \u201cWorthy is the Lamb!\u201d The message is firmly grounded in 1 John 4:12-16, John 17:20-23, and Revelation 5:9-11.

He empowers us by the Holy Ghost to be able to keep his word when we are willing to surrender our heart to his Lordship. A stirring word that will cause every sincere believer to examine his or her own heart. John 14:15 says if you love me you will keep my commandments.\u00a0 This is just the first of many other scriptures Brother Wilkerson uses to demonstrate the reality of what it means to love the Lord our God. It goes beyond feelings and sentiment. It involves more than your words. The Lord is looking for hearts that honestly reach out for him and has a desire to be obedient to his word.",

But in the beginning of my preaching, many would get converted but before long their conversions came to naught and they were back in their old ways. But in 1966 this Word took hold of me as I read the words, \"he who believes in Me out of his innermost being will flow rivers of Living Water\". However after twelve years of preaching I did not see the rivers in my life. I was at my brother's place and was in a great struggle at night so much that my pillow was wet with perspiration. I longed for God's Living Water like the Samaritan woman at the well. He said to her that if you drink of the Water that He shall give you, you won't thirst again, but if you drink of the water of the world you will thirst again (John 4:13-14).",

And then on the last day, the great day of the feast, Jesus got up and cried out. It was a very difficult time, because the Jews were planning to kill Him. And Jesus had to go to Galilee, among the gentiles to be safe. He wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t with the Jews, the so-called believers, because they were planning to kill Him. Jesus cried out, like an injured buck. What made Him cry out like this? It was because of all the people who claimed to be believers but there were no Living Rivers flowing from their innermost being! One river can change a desert into a garden. Imagine if there are many rivers flowing! Just think of South Africa, if all those rivers were flowing from us, how it will change South Africa.",

Jesus longs to reveal Himself to His church and with that revelation will come the knowledge of His burden for the lost. If we desire to hear God's voice we have to hear the whole package, the provision of God and the cry of God for the helplessness of humanity. We must offer all that we are so that God's heart would be satisfied in the earth. If you are willing to be given for others you will know and hear the voice of Jesus. The question is, \"will you give your all for the glory of God\"?",

SPURGEON, AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON. \u201cHe is of age; ask him: he shall speak for himself.\u201d-John 9:21 THOSE of you, dear friends, who were present this morning will remember that our subject was \u201cJesus Christ himself.\u201d We dwelt upon his blessed person. Our faith is fixed on him; our affections are drawn to him; our hopes all bend toward him. Though everything he said or did is precious, yet Jesus himself stands first in our estimation. To know him, to believe him, to love him, is the very essence of our Christianity. Tonight we change our theme. There is a \u201chimself\u201d in our text this evening- a \u201chimself\u201d \u2018tis true of a much humbler order. How stand we each one for himself? Our individuality and the personal responsibilities which fall upon ourselves in reference to Christ must not be lost sight of. If, for instance, a spiritual miracle has been wrought upon us, if we are obliged to confess-nay, if we are delighted to confess-that he has opened our eyes, then we are bound, especially those of us who are of ripe understanding, who may be said to be of full age, we are bound to bear our own personal testimony to him. The allegation and the appeal may alike apply to each one of us, \u201cHe is of age; ask him: he shall speak for himself.\u201d Jesus Christ himself bore our sins, as we heard this morning. He gave himself for us, he served us, not by proxy, but by personal consecration; not by alms doled out pitifully, but by his life surrendered...",

SPURGEON, AT NEW PARK STREET CHAPEL, SOUTHWARK, ON A THURSDAY EVENING, EARLY IN THE YEAR 1858. \u201cIt is the spirit that quickeneth; the flesh profiteth nothing.\u201d \u2014 John 6:63. To a casual reader, it looks as if the meaning of this passage lay upon the very surface; but he who has studied the chapter carefully has discovered that it is a sentence replete with many difficulties as to the exact interpretation of it. I shall not, however, waste your time by entering into any critical discussion of it; but shall only try to give you simply what I believe to be the mind of the Spirit, as uttered by the lips of Jesus in this passage; and after I have done that, I shall then revert to what I shall call the meaning which any person would give to it who is not a diligent and careful student of Scripture. That meaning being true, although not the special truth taught in this passage, I shall briefly enlarge upon it. \u201cIt is the spirit that quickeneth; the flesh profiteth nothing.\u201d I suppose there is not a man in the world who could form any intelligent idea of what a spirit is. It is very easy for persons to define a spirit by saying what it is not; but I query whether there is, or ever could be, any man who could form any idea of what it is. We sometimes talk about seeing a spirit; ignorant persons in ages gone by, and some living now in benighted villages, talk about seeing spirits by night.",

Its purpose is evangelical and is so stated in 20:31. John not only records events as do the other Gospels but also uniquely interprets the events by giving them spiritual meaning. The author makes significant use of such words as light, water, life, love, and bread. Traditionally the author of this Gospel is considered to have been John, the Beloved Disciple.",

With natural reason, assisted by some little light lingering in tradition, or borrowed from the Jews, a few philosophers spelled out the immortality of the soul; but that the body should rise again, that there should be another life for this corporeal frame, was a hope which is brought to light by the revelation of Christ Jesus. Men could not have imagined so great a wonder, and they prove their powerlessness to have invented it, by the fact, that still, as at Athens, when they hear of it for the first time, they fall to mocking. \u201cCan these dry bones live?\u201d is still the unbeliever's sneer. The doctrine of the resurrection is a lamp kindled by the hand which once was pierced. It is indeed in some respects the key-stone of the Christian arch. It is linked in our holy faith with the person of Jesus Christ, and is one of the brightest gems in his crown. What if I call it the signet on his finger, the seal by which he hath proven to a demonstration, that he hath the king's authority...",

The children of disobedience are lost and have a different spirit than the saved. The lost live according to the ways of this world and according to the Prince of the Power of the Air (Ephesians 2:2). Those who have been born of water only are fleshly (carnal); but those who have been born of the Holy Spirit are spiritual.

            "description": "This message was delivered on 03\/01\/1966. The end of all of God's ways is His glory. It does not always look like this to man, but God is working all things for His glory. We see this in the death of Lazarus. God was in total control of this situation, and the end was that God was glorified in Lazarus being raised from the dead. The end of God's ways and works is glory!! It doesn't always look that way. When God takes anything in hand, the end is going to be His glory. John 11 contains main factors of His ways and works. Incarnation - God becoming flesh. The method of God in redemption. The mystery of God's ways. (Providence). The farsightedness of God. We will only reach God's end only on the pathway of brokeness. True love will only come out of travail. We will only gain through loss. We will not gain anything of value unless it costs us something. The end of all God's ways is glory. There has got to be the basic and utter committal to the Lord. We shall never get beyond the point that there is no more battle for the revelation of the Lord. We must have the attitude of complete committal. Does the Lord have the mastery of your life? Is the Lord glorified in your life? Your job? Your home? Every aspect of your life? There is a sifting coming in the end. \"Judgement must begin at the House of God.\" If your priority in life is the glory of God, then God will bring you into the good of it. God's attitude to humanity at it's best is non-committal. The natural life will not get you through. Only that which is born of God.",

One that understands that God is love and also understands loving God with all of your heart, soul, and mind.  Through his love, God showed us his human face. Many have an inaccurate concept of God and who he is. God wants us to know he loves\u00a0us, and that he revealed himself to us through Jesus Christ. To know Christ\u00a0is to know God. Everything Jesus\u00a0did was to reconcile us to God. When we sin, we do not need to run and hide from God in fear and shame, suffering under condemnation and guilt. We need to run to him for\u00a0forgiveness. We must believe him, and come to him so he can lift our burden and reveal himself to us. He knows what is\u00a0best for us and wants a relationship with us as individuals.",

By 'law' he means characteristics or 'the realm of spiritual order' that govern prayer.  '[Even] grace has its mold of operation,' he said.  The practical, straight forward teaching from God's Word is wonderfully illustrated by answered prayers from the likes of George Muller, Watchman Nee and others.

He did not thus bear witness to himself, saying, \u201cI am the light of the world.\u201d But it was befitting on this occasion, when the people before him had already received sufficient evidence from other quarters. John the Baptist, whom all men counted for a prophet, had testified that Christ was the true light whim lighteth every man that cometh into the world. The witness of John they rejected; startling, if not conclusive, as it must have been, considering the esteem in which his oracular voice was held. Moreover, Jesus himself had wrought conviction in their own hearts by his own teaching. Had they not listened to his famous Sermon on the Mount? Could they not feel the authority with which he spoke? Did they not confess to the impressions he produced on them? The weight and the wisdom of his discourse manifested a power that could melt their thoughts into the very mould of his ministry. Nor was it merely his teaching, trance parent though that was; but the signs he showed and the miracles he wrought with the majesty of his voice and the virtue of his touch proclaimed that he was the light of the world.",

John 15 tells us about the pruning that all Christians will go through during their walk in and with Christ.

The problem is not so much error of doctrine as error of emphasis. A Fundamentalist himself, the pastor touches on the history of Fundamentalists and the trouble with increasingly detailed eschatology that has coincided with their emergence over the past 100 years. In spite of many Evangelicals\u2019 dogmatic preoccupation with how to view the millennium, something has not changed and must never be forgotten: Jesus is coming back. Take heed. Beware. Watch. Worship the Christ who is returning in time, and not the details of that time itself. The recording runs for 41 minutes, 21 seconds.",

SPURGEON, AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON. \u201cI must work the works of him that sent me, while it is day: the night cometh, when no man can work.\u201d \u2014 John 9:4. IF this ninth chapter of John is intended to be a continuation of the history contained in the eighth, as we think it is, it brings before us a very extraordinary fact. You will observe in the eighth chapter that our Lord was about to be stoned by the Jews; he therefore withdrew himself from the circle of his infuriated foes, and passed through the crowd, not I think in a hurried manner, but in a calm and dignified way, as one not at all disconcerted, but wholly self-possessed. His disciples, who had seen his danger, gathered round him while he quietly retreated. The group wended their way with firm footsteps till they reached the outside of the temple. At the gate there sat a man well known to have been blind from his birth; our Savior was so little flurried by the danger which had threatened him, that he paused and fixed his eye upon the poor beggar, attentively surveying him. He stayed his onward progress to work the miracle of this man's healing. If it be so that the two chapters make up but one narrative, and I think it is, though we are not absolutely sure, then we have before us a most memorable instance of the marvellous calmness of our Savior while under danger...",

Two of Carter\u2019s examples were people that had failed.  One was the high priest Joshua, standing before the throne of God in filthy rags had failed to build the temple.  The word picture about Joshua is a typical picture of Christ putting robes of righteousness on the sinner who comes to him.  This priest in filthy garments, who stands before the throne of God and then being given clean garments is compared to a Christian, who in the honesty of who he or she is, comes to Christ and receives garments of righteousness..  Another person of failure was Jacob at Bethel, who in being a liar, really didn\u2019t have the blessing until he admitted who he really was. In other words, when these two people came to and end of what they could do, they admitted their failings.  Carter\u2019s main text was in John 1:45, where a third example was the honest man Nathaniel.  Nathaniel recognizes who Christ is when Christ describes Nathaniel by stating that he is a man of no guile who he saw under the fig tree.  Nathaniel recognizes Christ when hearing this because he knew that Jesus was describing something that could only by said by the Messiah.",

Spiritual awakenening is when God speaks and He has free course in our hearts and there is no resistance to His voice. When God finds a heart that does not resist His spoken Word the miraculous starts to happen. He speaks with intelligent speech and the power behind His words begins to shape and reshape our lives. If we are truly His and have given ourselves to the Lord we don't resist what He speaks into our hearts, but rather embrace it as the highest way of life. God is calling us to believe what He has already spoken and wants us to bind ourselves to His Word by faith.",

From the sophisticated to the lowest people in society were deeply touched by his preaching. They all came into the wilderness to be baptised by him, confessing their sins. They were drawn into the wilderness by the power of God. The world was shaken. People began to ask if he was the Messiah. Eventually the religious leaders sent a delegation to him to ask whether he was the Messiah or Elijah, and by whose authority he baptises. Although he had an opportunity to grab the limelight, he instead gave his honest testimony, \"I am not the Messiah or Elijah; but I am the voice of one crying in the wilderness, Make straight the way of the Lord.\" In this we see a wonderful mystery - he was the voice of Him (God) crying in the wilderness that people ought to repent. It is also marvellous that we do not find a trace of haugtiness in John, when he acknowledges, \"I baptise with water, but there stands one among you, whom you do not know; He it is, who coming after me is preferred before me, whose shoe's latchet I am not worthy to unloose.\"",

The basic fruit of the Spirit is love it is at the heart of all the other fruits, the basis for the works of the flesh is self.

We are to watch for our brothers and sisters, and if we see them in a battle, we must be willing to fight for them. To go into the secret closet and war against this thing on their behalf, to love not just in word, but in deed. Selfishness has disastrous consequences. Take heed.",

At the cross you will find life and all the power of God that you will need. Secondly, begin to love your mom, wife, husband, brother and those around you. There is going to be a last days church that will come back to the cross trusting God for the power to forgive those who have wounded us. A supernatural love and care will come upon us, for those around us.

            "description": "Paul Washer sets out to answer the question of where his passion comes from, and in so doing he traces a path to the holiness and extra-ordinary majesty of God as seen by Isaiah. He reveals his own love for Godly men of old, who thought great thoughts about God, and whose writings have been influential in his own life. Reading from some of their writings, as well as his own notes, he explains something of what Isaiah saw. The Apostle John shows that Isaiah saw a revelation of the Son (thereby proving his eternal deity), yet Isaiah saw only an image, reduced to what his finite capacity could receive. Holiness is so much more than we think; holiness is the highest statement which could ever be made in regard to God; it speaks of separateness and uniqueness. And what is the effect of its revelation? We are faced with our own uncleanness and nothingness in the presence of a holy God; yet at the same time a Saviour is revealed to us in his condescending love. Let all flesh be abased, that God\u2019s glory may be the more elevated. (73 minutes)",

So also we must recognize that, being made as \u201cgods\u201d (John 10:34) we were given the free will to choose our present condition.  God is not to be blamed for the suffering we have chosen, neither is He to be blamed for the wreckage as a result of it.  Just as our Lord was, so also we need to be perfected through sufferings.  Suffering offers mankind the option to change.  We were cast out of eternity into time so that our decision could be corrected, and Jesus came and suffered for us so that we could be reconciled.",
