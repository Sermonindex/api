The new covenant begins with an assurance that our sins have been cleansed away, not just covered, coupled with a warning about the sin of unforgiveness.  Secondly, we can know Him personally as our Father, in living connection with Him all the day, both speaking and listening.  And finally, God writes upon the two tablets--the mind and the heart--to not only be willing but the grace as God's power to do it.",

            "description": "Carter\u2019s main point in this message is that when people come to Christ, they come as honest people, admitting who they really are. Two of Carter\u2019s examples were people that had failed.  One was the high priest Joshua, standing before the throne of God in filthy rags had failed to build the temple.  The word picture about Joshua is a typical picture of Christ putting robes of righteousness on the sinner who comes to him.  This priest in filthy garments, who stands before the throne of God and then being given clean garments is compared to a Christian, who in the honesty of who he or she is, comes to Christ and receives garments of righteousness..  Another person of failure was Jacob at Bethel, who in being a liar, really didn\u2019t have the blessing until he admitted who he really was. In other words, when these two people came to and end of what they could do, they admitted their failings.  Carter\u2019s main text was in John 1:45, where a third example was the honest man Nathaniel.  Nathaniel recognizes who Christ is when Christ describes Nathaniel by stating that he is a man of no guile who he saw under the fig tree.  Nathaniel recognizes Christ when hearing this because he knew that Jesus was describing something that could only by said by the Messiah.",

Spiritual awakenening is when God speaks and He has free course in our hearts and there is no resistance to His voice. When God finds a heart that does not resist His spoken Word the miraculous starts to happen. He speaks with intelligent speech and the power behind His words begins to shape and reshape our lives. If we are truly His and have given ourselves to the Lord we don't resist what He speaks into our hearts, but rather embrace it as the highest way of life. God is calling us to believe what He has already spoken and wants us to bind ourselves to His Word by faith.",

            "description": "John the Baptist spoke with authority about repentance. Before and after Jesus there were none who spoke about repentance as John the Baptist. From the sophisticated to the lowest people in society were deeply touched by his preaching. They all came into the wilderness to be baptised by him, confessing their sins. They were drawn into the wilderness by the power of God. The world was shaken. People began to ask if he was the Messiah. Eventually the religious leaders sent a delegation to him to ask whether he was the Messiah or Elijah, and by whose authority he baptises. Although he had an opportunity to grab the limelight, he instead gave his honest testimony, \"I am not the Messiah or Elijah; but I am the voice of one crying in the wilderness, Make straight the way of the Lord.\" In this we see a wonderful mystery - he was the voice of Him (God) crying in the wilderness that people ought to repent. It is also marvellous that we do not find a trace of haugtiness in John, when he acknowledges, \"I baptise with water, but there stands one among you, whom you do not know; He it is, who coming after me is preferred before me, whose shoe's latchet I am not worthy to unloose.\"",
