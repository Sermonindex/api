A goat is a goat and will be a goat till he dies.\" Tozer talks of his own pagan upbringing; how one night he came to know that he was \"Jesus' little boy\" and of his conversion seven years later - he was a lost sheep hearing a voice.",

When John Wesley ignored all church restrictions136 and religious propriety and preached in the fields and byways, men declared his reputation was ruined. So it has been in all ages. When the religious condition of the times called for men who were willing to sacrifice all for Christ, the demand created the supply, and there have always been found a few who have been willing to be regarded reckless for the Lord.

First, the voice of God will never promise us peace if we are embracing the same value system of the world. Second, the voice of God will challenge sin. In the dark days ahead the people of God will be lead into the tender mercies of God. God will give us a heart full of confidence when we choose to live uprightly.",

            "description": "Why cant we hear the voice of the Lord? One reason is that we don\u2019t have the mind of God and that is because we are not in the word of God. Secondly we are unwilling to hear what the Lord wants to speak to us. When we choose to deny ourself and live to glorify God, the Lord's voice will thunder into our heart. If you choose to live for His glory, He will speak to you and take you out of the image of self and bring you into the image of Christ. No matter what situation you find yourself in today God will still speak to you. The voice of the Lord is powerful and full of majesty. In His temple everyone speaks of His Glory!",

So also we must recognize that, being made as \u201cgods\u201d (John 10:34) we were given the free will to choose our present condition.  God is not to be blamed for the suffering we have chosen, neither is He to be blamed for the wreckage as a result of it.  Just as our Lord was, so also we need to be perfected through sufferings.  Suffering offers mankind the option to change.  We were cast out of eternity into time so that our decision could be corrected, and Jesus came and suffered for us so that we could be reconciled.",
