Tozer and spoke of him as one of the most influential voices in the Church in America. A.W. Tozer's materials are a mainstay in Evangelical churches in our day and he is one of the most quoted authors. He was a prophet in his day and his writings are even more influential in our day.

God was in total control of this situation, and the end was that God was glorified in Lazarus being raised from the dead. The end of God's ways and works is glory!! It doesn't always look that way. When God takes anything in hand, the end is going to be His glory. John 11 contains main factors of His ways and works. Incarnation - God becoming flesh. The method of God in redemption. The mystery of God's ways. (Providence). The farsightedness of God. We will only reach God's end only on the pathway of brokeness. True love will only come out of travail. We will only gain through loss. We will not gain anything of value unless it costs us something. The end of all God's ways is glory. There has got to be the basic and utter committal to the Lord. We shall never get beyond the point that there is no more battle for the revelation of the Lord. We must have the attitude of complete committal. Does the Lord have the mastery of your life? Is the Lord glorified in your life? Your job? Your home? Every aspect of your life? There is a sifting coming in the end. \"Judgement must begin at the House of God.\" If your priority in life is the glory of God, then God will bring you into the good of it. God's attitude to humanity at it's best is non-committal. The natural life will not get you through. Only that which is born of God.",

            "description": "'Is it not true that when we bow the knee to call upon the Lord,' says Heugel, ' our capacity for good is multiplied a hundred thousand times?'  Heugel believes that intercession is the greatest of all ministries, backing up his assertion with Scripture and example, both historical and personal.  He recounted the flame of intercession of the Moravians from which dawned the great movement of worldwide missions and strengthened his position upon great answers to prayer in the lives of Hudson Taylor, C. T. Studd and others.  (Part 1: The Laws of Prayer \/ Part 2: The Ministry of Prayer \/ Part 3: Great Prayers of History)",

Was a chaplain in WWI and a missionary in Mexico. He wrote many books that are worth reading. Huegel's writings on the deeper aspects of Christ's work on Calvary and it's implications for the believer have blessed multitudes of Christians. This biography is written by his son, who states in his preface that he has deliberately tried not to present his father's life through rose colored glasses but rather give a true and accurate account--warts and all. Those who have benefited from Huegel's other writings will welcome this unique chance to get a look at the man behind the books. Highly recommended!\r\nHe is the author of the book: \"Bone of His Bone\": One of the most basic principles for a successful life as a Christian is that the individual must experience full dependency on Jesus--allow Christ to become part of him. In effect he must become Bone of His Bone. Don't miss these freshly edited studies on the indwelling Christ.",

Unless something dies it will never know the resurrection power of Jesus. This is good instruction on our cross, serving others, as the Master did. Following Jesus will lead us to a place our flesh will not want to go, but we must endure the fire and die to self to get to the victory of seeing others reached through a yielded life. Jesus gave the perfect example of a vessel yielded totally to God and how many were reached and saved. He is our pattern, church. Not men.",
