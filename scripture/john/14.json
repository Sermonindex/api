He discusses in depth John 14:3. The \u201chouse\u201d referred to in the phrase \u201cIn My Father\u2019s House\u2026\u201d is not Heaven, but Jesus Himself \u2013 Jesus is the house of God. Not that Heaven does not exist, but it is not the goal. Jesus is the Father\u2019s house, and He makes a place in Himself for us, so that we become a room in that house.

The problem is not so much error of doctrine as error of emphasis. A Fundamentalist himself, the pastor touches on the history of Fundamentalists and the trouble with increasingly detailed eschatology that has coincided with their emergence over the past 100 years. In spite of many Evangelicals\u2019 dogmatic preoccupation with how to view the millennium, something has not changed and must never be forgotten: Jesus is coming back. Take heed. Beware. Watch. Worship the Christ who is returning in time, and not the details of that time itself. The recording runs for 41 minutes, 21 seconds.",

            "description": "McGee begins his message   by reminding us that the Bible says little about   heaven.  However, he does not leave us disappointed!He extracts teachings from John 14 and Revelation 21 in such a way that a longing for heaven is stirred within us.
