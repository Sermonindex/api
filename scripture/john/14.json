Was a Christian missionary, teacher, writer, and advocate of economic development in impoverished nations. A spiritual crisis during this period\u2014as he described two decades later in what is probably his best-known recorded teaching, \"Ten Shekels and a Shirt\"--left Reidhead with the conviction that much of evangelicalism had adopted utilitarian and humanistic philosophies contradictory to Biblical teaching. The end of all being, he came to believe, was not the happiness of man, but the glorification of God. This theme would recur throughout his later teaching.\r\n\r\nSince Mr. Reidhead's death in 1992, Bible Teaching Ministries, Inc. continues under the leadership of his wife, Marjorie, and daughter, Virginia Teitt, a dedicated Board, and the many people who have donated time and talent after being changed by God\u2019s Word through this message.

Was a preacher born in Bangor, County Down, Ireland. Nicknamed \"the Tornado of the Pulpit\", Nicholson spent his early years on his father's cargo ship. He began to preach Christianity in 1899 at the age of 23 and was known for his \"men-only\" meetings. Nicholson used straightforward language which communicated to the common man.\r\n\"Nicholson used to say that when a mission was begun it was not long before they had either a riot or revival. Sometimes we had more riot than revival, but never a revival without a riot.\" Nicholson wielded the Sword of the Spirit with a fury. His hearers were always affected one way or another. Some through his preaching were brought to humble repentance, while others resisted God's Word with indignation. Two favorite themes of Nicholson were \"God's love\" and \"God's hell.\" W. P. Nicholson always preached the love of God with all the warmth and tenderness he could muster; but for those who rejected this Good News, he offered the only alternative, GOD'S HELL. He preached on every aspect of hell with such zeal and passion that his hearers claimed to be able to almost smell the burning sulphur. Still others, under deep conviction and anxiety, dripped with sweat and unconsciously shredded the hymn books they held in their laps. Through this kind of fervent preaching, God brought entire communities face to face with the question, \"What shall I do with Jesus?\" One elderly man who had recollections of the Ulster Revival of 1859 said that some of the effects of Nicholson's meetings even exceeded what happened in '59. Another commentator on Nicholson's work said that he had seen nothing like it since the days of D. L. Moody.",

A spiritual crisis during this period\u2014as he described two decades later in what is probably his best-known recorded teaching, \"Ten Shekels and a Shirt\"--left Reidhead with the conviction that much of evangelicalism had adopted utilitarian and humanistic philosophies contradictory to Biblical teaching.

This theme would recur throughout his later teaching.\r\n\r\nSince Mr. Reidhead's death in 1992, Bible Teaching Ministries, Inc. continues under the leadership of his wife, Marjorie, and daughter, Virginia Teitt, a dedicated Board, and the many people who have donated time and talent after being changed by God\u2019s Word through this message.

As a young man he became aware that the Lord was calling him into the work of the ministry. At timely stages the Lord placed folk in his path who were able to direct him into the truth of heart purity and a more expansive understanding of the ministry of the Holy Spirit. He held pastorates in Kent and Bradford. By the late 1960s, following a significant period of ministry in Liverpool, he began a more itinerant ministry. This led him to many parts of the world, and occupied him until well into his eighties. His powerful preaching and the unique sense of the Lord's presence, which seemed to brood over his meetings, were always intensely challenging.\r\nThe true secret of his remarkable ministry stemmed from his personal communion with the Lord Jesus. To him, 'entering the holiest' was not merely a theological concept; it was a distinct spiritual reality - and the central feature of his spiritual life. It was here, in the place of worship, that his revelatory ministry found its source. He preached from understanding and conviction. He was never the echo of another, nor did he take on board the ebb and flow of various contemporary emphases. He was not a man of 'books'; he soaked himself in Scripture and allowed it to saturate his heart and mind. Truly, this is a man who has lifted up a standard for the people. Mr North went to be with the Lord on 29th April 2003, shortly after his ninetieth birthday.",

The problem is not so much error of doctrine as error of emphasis. A Fundamentalist himself, the pastor touches on the history of Fundamentalists and the trouble with increasingly detailed eschatology that has coincided with their emergence over the past 100 years. In spite of many Evangelicals\u2019 dogmatic preoccupation with how to view the millennium, something has not changed and must never be forgotten: Jesus is coming back. Take heed. Beware. Watch.

Was a preacher born in Bangor, County Down, Ireland. Nicknamed \"the Tornado of the Pulpit\", Nicholson spent his early years on his father's cargo ship. He began to preach Christianity in 1899 at the age of 23 and was known for his \"men-only\" meetings. Nicholson used straightforward language which communicated to the common man.\r\n\"Nicholson used to say that when a mission was begun it was not long before they had either a riot or revival. Sometimes we had more riot than revival, but never a revival without a riot.\" Nicholson wielded the Sword of the Spirit with a fury. His hearers were always affected one way or another. Some through his preaching were brought to humble repentance, while others resisted God's Word with indignation. Two favorite themes of Nicholson were \"God's love\" and \"God's hell.\" W. P. Nicholson always preached the love of God with all the warmth and tenderness he could muster; but for those who rejected this Good News, he offered the only alternative, GOD'S HELL. He preached on every aspect of hell with such zeal and passion that his hearers claimed to be able to almost smell the burning sulphur. Still others, under deep conviction and anxiety, dripped with sweat and unconsciously shredded the hymn books they held in their laps. Through this kind of fervent preaching, God brought entire communities face to face with the question, \"What shall I do with Jesus?\" One elderly man who had recollections of the Ulster Revival of 1859 said that some of the effects of Nicholson's meetings even exceeded what happened in '59. Another commentator on Nicholson's work said that he had seen nothing like it since the days of D. L. Moody.",
