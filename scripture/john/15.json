The practical, straight forward teaching from God's Word is wonderfully illustrated by answered prayers from the likes of George Muller, Watchman Nee and others.

Huegel's writings on the deeper aspects of Christ's work on Calvary and it's implications for the believer have blessed multitudes of Christians. This biography is written by his son, who states in his preface that he has deliberately tried not to present his father's life through rose colored glasses but rather give a true and accurate account--warts and all. Those who have benefited from Huegel's other writings will welcome this unique chance to get a look at the man behind the books. Highly recommended!\r\nHe is the author of the book: \"Bone of His Bone\": One of the most basic principles for a successful life as a Christian is that the individual must experience full dependency on Jesus--allow Christ to become part of him. In effect he must become Bone of His Bone. Don't miss these freshly edited studies on the indwelling Christ.",
