It is accepted as the will of God at times to suffer601 and to even expect severe persecution. This type of suffering produces a joy602 and sense of privilege that they are willing to identify with their precious Lord who has saved them.",

            "description": "The greatest failure of the Church in many nations is the lack of preparing Christians for persecution. Persecution is certain. It is told to us by the Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of God, Himself. In the Gospel of John it says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Remember what I told you: \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcA servant is not greater than his Master.\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 If they persecuted Me, they will persecute you also.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d815 We can believe what Jesus says and we can rely on it. Also in the United States of America and Canada, persecution is certain. In the second Epistle to Timothy it says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153In fact, everyone who wants to live a godly life in Christ Jesus will be persecuted.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d",

If we don't abide in him, we will wither and die on the vine, and be cut off, bundled up and cast away. Repeatedly, Jesus warned his disciples against unbelief. He is all we need and he has all we need no matter what happens. You can't enter into the rest of Christ until you understand your position in him. Just because you fail doesn't mean you drop off the vine. Wonderful message of assurance.",

John 15 tells us about the pruning that all Christians will go through during their walk in and with Christ.  It is God\u2019s purpose for all of His to bear good fruit and part of bearing good fruit is the pruning process.  Learn the divine destiny of each and every Christian from past to future.",

Loving others is hopeless unless we abide in Christ and allow Him to do through us what we cannot do for ourselves. It has to be Christ in us - the newness of His life and love flowing in us and through us. Unconditional giving of ourselves is the basis for an explosion of joy! Start loving and be ready for the miraculous.",

The basic fruit of the Spirit is love it is at the heart of all the other fruits, the basis for the works of the flesh is self. A great truth is revealed in this message that we do not bear fruit by asking for it but by confessing and dealing with our sin then the Lord will help us to bear fruit.",

The heart of Christ is to minister to and serve others, and he wants us to share his heart. The devil is trying to destroy the Body, going after the weak and the young. We are to watch for our brothers and sisters, and if we see them in a battle, we must be willing to fight for them. To go into the secret closet and war against this thing on their behalf, to love not just in word, but in deed. Selfishness has disastrous consequences. Take heed.",

As Scripture says in the 2nd Chapter of Romans\u2026  \u201cthe name of God is blasphemed by the Gentiles because of you.",
