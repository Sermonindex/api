His eschatological insight is a very needful truth to be realized in the body of Christ. \r\n\r\nArt was a prophetic voice insofar as he called his listeners to purposes in God that would affect both time and eternity, purposes that had to do with the glory of God in the Church.   Frequently, his messages called the Church to an awareness of the Last Days [End-times] in such a way that made that time seem imminent and at the door.",

Dr. Tozer boldly asserts that \u201cGod takes pleasure in himself, and rejoices in his own perfections,\u201d and the pastor cites the beauties of energy, light, and color as evidence of the joy with which God creates. The message is firmly grounded in 1 John 4:12-16, John 17:20-23, and Revelation 5:9-11. Part 2 is 13 minutes and 54 seconds in length.",

There wasn\u2019t a funeral at the creation of the world; there was an anthem, and all the creature creations sang! And at the incarnation they sang!\u201d There was singing at the resurrection and we\u2019ll sing at the rapture and the consummation, and the song will be \u201cWorthy is the Lamb!\u201d The message is firmly grounded in 1 John 4:12-16, John 17:20-23, and Revelation 5:9-11.
