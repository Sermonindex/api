The pride of self-righteous religion (the high priest). 2. The fear of the individualist (Peter). 3. The power of the cynical, unbelieving world. (Pilate)",

SPURGEON, AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON. \u201cPilate therefore said unto him, Art thou a king then? Jesus answered, Thou sayest that I am a king. To this end was I born, and for this cause came I into the world, that I should bear witness unto the truth. Every one that is of the truth heareth my voice.\u201d \u2014 John 18:37. THE season is almost arrived when by the custom of our fellow-citizens we are led to remember the birth of the holy child Jesus, who was born \u201cking of the Jews.\u201d I shall not, however, conduct you to Bethlehem, but to the foot of Calvary; there we shall learn, from the Lord's own lips, something concerning the kingdom over which he rules, and thus we shall be led to prize more highly the joyous event of his nativity. We are told, by the apostle Paul, that our Lord Jesus Christ before Pontius Pilate witnessed a good confession. It was a good confession as to the manner of it, for our Lord was truthful, gentle, prudent, patient, meek, and yet, withal, uncompromising, and courageous. His spirit was not cowed by Pilate's power, nor exasperated by his sneers. In his patience he possessed his soul, and remained the model witness for the truth \u2014 both in his silence and in his speech. He witnessed a good confession also, as to the matter of it; for, though he said but little, that little was all that was needful.",

When Truth stands before the unsaved and God begins to reveal Himself through our lives, the truth that is in us will force a man to search his heart. The man or woman that is a witness to truth shows a dying world that there us a Living God that bears witness to Himself through our lives.",
