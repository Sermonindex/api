            "description": "June 04, 2006 \u2013 When we choose to follow Jesus there has to be a complete upheaval of a former inner value system. So many today are following the wrong Jesus. Many don\u2019t want to follow a Christ that uses His resources and power to help others. Many want the power of Christ but not the path of Christ. Folloing Jesus will lead us down a road of self sacrafice. It is at this crossroad where many turn away from folowing the Jesus of the bible.",

At the cross you will find life and all the power of God that you will need. Secondly, begin to love your mom, wife, husband, brother and those around you. There is going to be a last days church that will come back to the cross trusting God for the power to forgive those who have wounded us. A supernatural love and care will come upon us, for those around us. In this Cross Centered Church the heart of the Father will be turned to the children and the hearts of the children to the Father.",
