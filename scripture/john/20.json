Suddenly Jesus was among them saying, \"Peace be with you\". Jesus needs no key to enter the room. Even if there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no door, He can go right through the wall. Then He showed them His hands and feet. You\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve heard how his majesty said unashamedly that Jesus is His Lord before the whole world. Jesus said that he who is ashamed of Me, of him I will be ashamed before the Father and His holy angels (Luke 9:26). A certain very prominent judge in Germany has said that if all the evidence and witnesses in the Bible be judged in a court of law, the verdict would be clear that indeed Jesus had risen from the dead! If you refuse to believe after all the evidence had been laid out before you, no wonder that your condemnation in hell will be just.",

God offers a personal relationship to all who desire Him with a sincere heart. When you come with a sincere heart the first thing you will see is His mercy. As you behold the mercy of God and the promises of God you will be changed into a new person. God longs to give you something deeper than a casual relationship. He longs to give you something deeper than just knowing some facts about Him. Have the courage to go deeper and come home to God today!",

            "description": "This is a wonderful sermon on having a relationship with God the Father.  One that understands that God is love and also understands loving God with all of your heart, soul, and mind.  Through his love, God showed us his human face. Many have an inaccurate concept of God and who he is. God wants us to know he loves\u00a0us, and that he revealed himself to us through Jesus Christ. To know Christ\u00a0is to know God. Everything Jesus\u00a0did was to reconcile us to God. When we sin, we do not need to run and hide from God in fear and shame, suffering under condemnation and guilt. We need to run to him for\u00a0forgiveness. We must believe him, and come to him so he can lift our burden and reveal himself to us. He knows what is\u00a0best for us and wants a relationship with us as individuals.",
