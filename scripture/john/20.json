Then He showed them His hands and feet. You\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve heard how his majesty said unashamedly that Jesus is His Lord before the whole world. Jesus said that he who is ashamed of Me, of him I will be ashamed before the Father and His holy angels (Luke 9:26). A certain very prominent judge in Germany has said that if all the evidence and witnesses in the Bible be judged in a court of law, the verdict would be clear that indeed Jesus had risen from the dead!

God offers a personal relationship to all who desire Him with a sincere heart. When you come with a sincere heart the first thing you will see is His mercy. As you behold the mercy of God and the promises of God you will be changed into a new person. God longs to give you something deeper than a casual relationship. He longs to give you something deeper than just knowing some facts about Him. Have the courage to go deeper and come home to God today!",

She was used of the Lord to help found the Evangelical Sisterhood of Mary. The Lord has used her writings powerfully to help encourage the greater body of Christ of future sufferings for the Lord and how to endure them.
