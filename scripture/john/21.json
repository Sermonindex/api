One that understands that God is love and also understands loving God with all of your heart, soul, and mind.  Through his love, God showed us his human face. Many have an inaccurate concept of God and who he is. God wants us to know he loves\u00a0us, and that he revealed himself to us through Jesus Christ. To know Christ\u00a0is to know God. Everything Jesus\u00a0did was to reconcile us to God. When we sin, we do not need to run and hide from God in fear and shame, suffering under condemnation and guilt. We need to run to him for\u00a0forgiveness. We must believe him, and come to him so he can lift our burden and reveal himself to us. He knows what is\u00a0best for us and wants a relationship with us as individuals.",
