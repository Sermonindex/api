            "description": "To pursue God's heart is to find a new value system for seeking wisdom rather than riches or your works. And scripture says \"He that winneth souls is wise\". When you are in love with Christ, it draws people to you. The joy it brings will make people around you sit up and take notice. And the joy of the Lord is your strength. Soul winning is the heart of Christ in you reaching out to the lost around you. Without intimate time alone with God you cannot be a soul winner.  You have to get close to God and be led by his Spirit.",

            "description": "Using John 4 and the story of the woman at the well with Jesus, Bro. Wilkerson explains how our Lord wants us after we offer up our praise, prayers and petitions, to wait in his presence so he can in return speak to us. To lay hold of the truth in this message, in Luke 17:7-10, the parable of the Lord instructing his servant who's just come in from his labors to gird himself and serve his Lord, and then he may eat is clearly expounded in a way that will excite and transform your prayer life. This gives an exciting expectancy to the scripture \"Wait upon the Lord and he will renew your strength.\" It is humbling to know our Lord is hungry for fellowship with his children.",

            "description": "A. W. Tozer\u2019s message, \u201cGod Made Man to Worship,\u201d is dense with information that every Christian would do well to understand. God doesn\u2019t need us, but He wants us. Though man possesses a natural desire to worship, he wishes to worship any way he feels like worshiping. The God who wants us to worship Him, however, has decreed how we are to do so. Pastor Tozer details three kinds of worship that God outrightly rejects: 1) \u201cCain worship:\u201d worship without atonement. 2) \u201cSamaritan worship:\u201d accepting what one wants to believe, neglecting what one doesn\u2019t, and adding what\u2019s not there at all. 3) \u201cNature worship:\u201d mistaking worship of God\u2019s creation for worship of God himself. John 4:24 describes the kind of worship that God gladly accepts. Psalm 45:11 and 2 Thessalonians 1:10 are also texts for this 39-minute sermon.",
