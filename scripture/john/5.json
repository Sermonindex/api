The good news is that behind every command of Jesus is the grace and power to do it!",

SPURGEON, AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON. \u201cMarvel not at this: for the hour is coming, in the which all that are in the graves shall hear his voice, and shall come forth; they that have done good, unto the resurrection of life; and they that have done evil, unto the resurrection of damnation.\u201d \u2014 John 5:28,29. THE doctrine of the resurrection of the dead is peculiarly a Christian belief. With natural reason, assisted by some little light lingering in tradition, or borrowed from the Jews, a few philosophers spelled out the immortality of the soul; but that the body should rise again, that there should be another life for this corporeal frame, was a hope which is brought to light by the revelation of Christ Jesus. Men could not have imagined so great a wonder, and they prove their powerlessness to have invented it, by the fact, that still, as at Athens, when they hear of it for the first time, they fall to mocking. \u201cCan these dry bones live?\u201d is still the unbeliever's sneer. The doctrine of the resurrection is a lamp kindled by the hand which once was pierced. It is indeed in some respects the key-stone of the Christian arch. It is linked in our holy faith with the person of Jesus Christ, and is one of the brightest gems in his crown. What if I call it the signet on his finger, the seal by which he hath proven to a demonstration, that he hath the king's authority...",

            "description": "Revival is ALL His work. The ability to repent is only by the grace of God. We cannot repent of our own, only by the work of the Holy Spirit. Faith comes by hearing; hearing comes by the Word of God, but the Word of God coupled with only with the Holy Spirit is really hearing and understanding. Other than that, it is knowledge. Therefore, this work of the Holy Spirit, Jesus said, \u201cWAIT\u201d and tarry here in Jerusalem until you be endued with the power of the Holy Spirit. Sometimes there is no need to preach. What we need is to sense the need of revival and just \u2018tarry\u2019 before the Lord in prayer until we sense that God is hearing and answering our prayers by sending us the Holy Spirit that we might have genuine repentance and genuine faith and a genuine work of God.",

Preaching from the Gospel of John, Wilkerson teaches us on the powerful outcome of a constant walk with God.  Jesus is our example and we are to follow him.  This is a great sermon on the walk of Jesus and how we are to walk this day.",
