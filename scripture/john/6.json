It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s this: that we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re learning, slowly, to abandon ourselves. Now, a person, of course, can abandon himself to sin\u00e2\u20ac\u201dto flesh, to lust, to pride, to sensitiveness, to all the works of the flesh.  But the wonderful thing is that we have learned\u00e2\u20ac\u201dor are learning\u00e2\u20ac\u201dto abandon ourselves to Jesus, or \u00e2\u20ac\u0153wholly give ourselves to One who gives Himself to us\u00e2\u20ac\u009d.",

If you are then you're going to change your praying. Instead of saying, initially, 'Lord, save Him,' you're going to say, 'Lord, slay him. Bring him to the awareness of his desperate plight.

SPURGEON, AT NEW PARK STREET CHAPEL, SOUTHWARK, ON A THURSDAY EVENING, EARLY IN THE YEAR 1858. \u201cIt is the spirit that quickeneth; the flesh profiteth nothing.\u201d \u2014 John 6:63. To a casual reader, it looks as if the meaning of this passage lay upon the very surface; but he who has studied the chapter carefully has discovered that it is a sentence replete with many difficulties as to the exact interpretation of it. I shall not, however, waste your time by entering into any critical discussion of it; but shall only try to give you simply what I believe to be the mind of the Spirit, as uttered by the lips of Jesus in this passage; and after I have done that, I shall then revert to what I shall call the meaning which any person would give to it who is not a diligent and careful student of Scripture. That meaning being true, although not the special truth taught in this passage, I shall briefly enlarge upon it. \u201cIt is the spirit that quickeneth; the flesh profiteth nothing.\u201d I suppose there is not a man in the world who could form any intelligent idea of what a spirit is. It is very easy for persons to define a spirit by saying what it is not; but I query whether there is, or ever could be, any man who could form any idea of what it is. We sometimes talk about seeing a spirit; ignorant persons in ages gone by, and some living now in benighted villages, talk about seeing spirits by night.",
