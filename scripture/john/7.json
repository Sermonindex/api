Today Jesus stands and cries out the same words to a church that has no the prophetic word and no manifest presence of the Spirit. Verse 39 explains why: \"the Holy Ghost was not yet given; because that Jesus was not yet glorified.\" The Holy Spirit is not given when Jesus is not glorified and His Lordship not recognized. The baptism of the Holy Spirit is the coronation of the Lord Jesus in the heart of the believer. Revival is the coronation of the Lord Jesus in His church.",

            "description": "Before the revival I was troubled, for I would go around holding services and many would repent. But after 2 or 3 years when I return to visit them again I would find the Christians in disunity. But we read in Acts how the early Christians were of one heart and soul (Acts 4:32). But what I found among the Christians were in opposition to this, the one would criticize the next; the other would complain that they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re not treated well or greeted properly. I knew that revival wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t start if things didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t come right among the Christians first, for the Bible says that judgment must begin in the house of God (1Pet 4:17). The reason the Word of God, the Bible, doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t cover the earth, is not because of the heathen, but because of the Christians that aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t living according to the Word of God. Jesus said that the one who believes in Him as the Scripture has said, from his innermost being will flow rivers of Living Waters. Rivers of water cannot be stopped. You might try to stop a river by building a restraining wall in the river, but the water will only build up on the one side and eventually break the wall in a massive flood, or the water will rise up and flow over the wall.",

Yet he stayed true to God's call on his life prayed and pleading for true heaven sent revival. \r\n\r\n\"Those who know of Leonard Ravenhill recognize in him the religious specialist, the man sent from God to battle the priests of Baal on their own mountain top, to shame the careless priest at the altar, to face the false prophet, and to warn the people who are being led astray by him. \" - Tozer | \"Leonard Ravenhill was one of the few men I have ever known who was a true prophet.\" - David Wilkerson",

            "description": "From the beginning of the revival this Word was very precious. Since I've been converted I longed for God to work among people. But in the beginning of my preaching, many would get converted but before long their conversions came to naught and they were back in their old ways. But in 1966 this Word took hold of me as I read the words, \"he who believes in Me out of his innermost being will flow rivers of Living Water\". However after twelve years of preaching I did not see the rivers in my life. I was at my brother's place and was in a great struggle at night so much that my pillow was wet with perspiration. I longed for God's Living Water like the Samaritan woman at the well. He said to her that if you drink of the Water that He shall give you, you won't thirst again, but if you drink of the water of the world you will thirst again (John 4:13-14).",

And then on the last day, the great day of the feast, Jesus got up and cried out. It was a very difficult time, because the Jews were planning to kill Him. And Jesus had to go to Galilee, among the gentiles to be safe. He wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t with the Jews, the so-called believers, because they were planning to kill Him. Jesus cried out, like an injured buck. What made Him cry out like this? It was because of all the people who claimed to be believers but there were no Living Rivers flowing from their innermost being! One river can change a desert into a garden. Imagine if there are many rivers flowing! Just think of South Africa, if all those rivers were flowing from us, how it will change South Africa.",
