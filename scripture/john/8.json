Over the past 50 years particularly originating in Western countries there have been such excesses and abuses of what is considered Spirit-filled Christianity that many true believers have been repulsed completely from even seeking the Lord for the true filling of the Spirit. This is not only a tragedy but one of Satan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tactics323 to hinder the growth of the true Church of Jesus Christ. The genuine believer should never feel scared to call out to God for fresh infusions of the Spirit of God for service324 and to foster a dependence on the Holy Spirit of God daily in his life.",
