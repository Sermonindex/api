            "description": "Jonah here is asleep in the boat and ignorant of the need of those around him, this is picture of the majority of the church (espescially in the West) today. We are asleep to the needs of the world all around us who are second by second plummeting into a lost eternity without the very Light that we hold. Pastor Legge tells how only 1% of the total money donated to missions goes to the nations where the majority of people have not even heard the name of Christ, but 87% goes to already evangelised and, so called, christian countries. He shows how we have turned the Great Commision on it's head as again only 1% of the total money donated to missions goes to the evangelism of the Jewish people. Christ has purchased with His own blood the very vaccine that this sin sick world needs and yet we who have it seem so reluctant to administer the cure. When will the sleeping giant that is the Church arise from her slumber?\r\n\r\n[i]All material by Pastor Legge is copyrighted.

They settle for less than God intended for them. I have to say that there can even be resentment, or resistance, shown toward anyone who will try to get God's people over the Jordan and into their inheritance.\" - David Legge",

Wilder-Smith says that the marks of death upon a preacher will cause there to be a hearing on the parts of the recipients of the sermons.  The death of the cross must be seen in the preacher before his message will be heard.   We must be crucified for Christ\u2019s sake.  Even the king of Nineveh will listen to that man.",

The voice of God is crying out to all His people who are in a spiritual slumber because of self seeking, soft religion. God in His mercy will prepare a trial that will lead us into a type of the sufferings of Christ. This crisis will cause us to be awakened to prayer, and in this time God will throw overboard everything that hinders us from His power. The moment we surrender and yield our life to God's purposes, His mercy will begin to flow in us and through us. The Holy Spirit will give us the courage to stand in the midst of adversity, and speak life into others around us who are perishing.",
