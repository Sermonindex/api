As usual, he draws a gold mine of truths in light of knowing the Lord Jesus Christ from the life of this prophet.

We are asleep to the needs of the world all around us who are second by second plummeting into a lost eternity without the very Light that we hold. Pastor Legge tells how only 1% of the total money donated to missions goes to the nations where the majority of people have not even heard the name of Christ, but 87% goes to already evangelised and, so called, christian countries. He shows how we have turned the Great Commision on it's head as again only 1% of the total money donated to missions goes to the evangelism of the Jewish people. Christ has purchased with His own blood the very vaccine that this sin sick world needs and yet we who have it seem so reluctant to administer the cure. When will the sleeping giant that is the Church arise from her slumber?\r\n\r\n[i]All material by Pastor Legge is copyrighted.
