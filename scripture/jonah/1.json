Brother Ed lays the groundwork for this 5-part series in which he expounds upon 3 general themes: 1) The crisis in Jonah\u2019s heart, 2) a book of miracles, and 3) a book of the undeserved mercy of God.  As usual, he draws a gold mine of truths in light of knowing the Lord Jesus Christ from the life of this prophet. (This series of messages was delivered on Labor day weekend 2001 in Bridgeville, Maryland)",

            "description": "Jonah here is asleep in the boat and ignorant of the need of those around him, this is picture of the majority of the church (espescially in the West) today. We are asleep to the needs of the world all around us who are second by second plummeting into a lost eternity without the very Light that we hold. Pastor Legge tells how only 1% of the total money donated to missions goes to the nations where the majority of people have not even heard the name of Christ, but 87% goes to already evangelised and, so called, christian countries. He shows how we have turned the Great Commision on it's head as again only 1% of the total money donated to missions goes to the evangelism of the Jewish people. Christ has purchased with His own blood the very vaccine that this sin sick world needs and yet we who have it seem so reluctant to administer the cure. When will the sleeping giant that is the Church arise from her slumber?\r\n\r\n[i]All material by Pastor Legge is copyrighted.
