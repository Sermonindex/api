            "description": "Joshua means minister. The word minister means servant. Jesus said if anyone wants to be chief among you he must become a servant to all. Joshua was Moses personal servant. After the death of Moses God elevated him from Moses servant to the head of Israel. This is always the process of God. If we are faithful with the little things then He will allow us to be entrusted with bigger things. If we have not been faithful with worldly possessions of family how can we be entrusted with the spiritual riches. The most important ministries are ones that cannot been seen and what great rewards for ministries of intercessory prayer. We are all called by God to be full time ministry serving the Lord, whatever we do in word or deed we need to do it unto the Lord. We need to get away from that idea that the minister is someone especially holy or above the others. As a minister we are actually a servant and its Gods calling. The name Joshua was given by Moses which means Salvation, and after Moses renamed His name to mean: Jehovah is Salvation. In Joshua is an very interesting type of Christ.",

            "description": "Manasseh took part of its inheritance on the other side of the Jordan. They did not fully take over the Canaanites this was their mistake to not come into the full victory that God desired for them. This is a spiritual allegory that we are to come out of the bondage of Egypt which is sin and death and to come into the Land of promise which is the victorious spiritual life in Christ. Gods desire is for us to have all our enemies utterly driven out. We need to enter into the full victory by Christ and if these areas are not fully taken by faith and the promise of God then the devil will use it in our future. Let us not follow after the same example but follow after the spirit. We need to be totally open to God for what He has for us. Its sad to have a concept of God that limits us from God working in our life how He wants to. We cannot but any restraints on what he wants to do in our life and through our life. Why should we come short of the fullness God desires for our life. We need to give all areas of flesh that are not given into the ruler ship of Christ by the Spirit in our life.",

            "description": "The kings of Canaan thought the only hope to stop the armies of Israel was that they should all band their armies together against them in a sort of collation. The gibonites knew their only hope of making a covenant was to do it in disguise. They came to the camp of Israel in disguise to make peace with you, they brought moldy bread and clothes to make a peace treaty. Israel did not inquire of the Lord but rather make the pack with them and were deceived. This was the second mistake of Joshua as an army leader and the people began to murmur against Him. It was a fault of not relying on God. It was his failure to pray also at EI so that the troops were killed. He should have sought the council of God, inquiring not of the Lord. How many times we find ourselves in ungodly situations if we not only sought Gods guidance first. But of course we cry out to God before that but why don\u2019t we first seek God and escape from failing into these situations.",

JOSHUA was very highly favored in the matter of promises. The promises given him by God were broadly comprehensive and exceedingly encouraging. But Joshua was not therefore to say within himself, \u201cThese covenant engagements will surely be fulfilled, and I may therefore sit still and do nothing.\u201d On the contrary, because God had decreed that the land should be conquered, Joshua was to be diligent to lead the people onward to battle. He was not to use the promise as a couch upon which his indolence might luxuriate, but as a girdle wherewith to gird up his loins for future activity. As a spur to energy, let us always regard the gracious promises of our God. We should sin against him most ungratefully and detestably were we to say within ourselves, \u201cGod will not desert his people; therefore let us venture into sin;\u201d and we are almost equally wicked if we whisper in our own minds,\u201d God will assuredly fulfill his own decrees, and give the souls of his redeemed as a reward to his Son Jesus. therefore let us do nothing, and refrain altogether from zealous Christian service.\u201d This is not proper language for true children...",
