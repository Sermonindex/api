            "description": "Joshua means minister. The word minister means servant. Jesus said if anyone wants to be chief among you he must become a servant to all. Joshua was Moses personal servant. After the death of Moses God elevated him from Moses servant to the head of Israel. This is always the process of God. If we are faithful with the little things then He will allow us to be entrusted with bigger things. If we have not been faithful with worldly possessions of family how can we be entrusted with the spiritual riches. The most important ministries are ones that cannot been seen and what great rewards for ministries of intercessory prayer. We are all called by God to be full time ministry serving the Lord, whatever we do in word or deed we need to do it unto the Lord. We need to get away from that idea that the minister is someone especially holy or above the others. As a minister we are actually a servant and its Gods calling. The name Joshua was given by Moses which means Salvation, and after Moses renamed His name to mean: Jehovah is Salvation. In Joshua is an very interesting type of Christ.",

He takes time to elaborate on Psalm 1:1, quickly addresses \u201cunconditional love,\u201d and then discusses the Army of the Lord. All of this is within the context of Joshua 1, and the transition from Moses to Joshua. This sermon is much more practical than it sounds. (1 hr 7 min 9 sec)",

JOSHUA was very highly favored in the matter of promises. The promises given him by God were broadly comprehensive and exceedingly encouraging. But Joshua was not therefore to say within himself, \u201cThese covenant engagements will surely be fulfilled, and I may therefore sit still and do nothing.\u201d On the contrary, because God had decreed that the land should be conquered, Joshua was to be diligent to lead the people onward to battle. He was not to use the promise as a couch upon which his indolence might luxuriate, but as a girdle wherewith to gird up his loins for future activity. As a spur to energy, let us always regard the gracious promises of our God. We should sin against him most ungratefully and detestably were we to say within ourselves, \u201cGod will not desert his people; therefore let us venture into sin;\u201d and we are almost equally wicked if we whisper in our own minds,\u201d God will assuredly fulfill his own decrees, and give the souls of his redeemed as a reward to his Son Jesus. therefore let us do nothing, and refrain altogether from zealous Christian service.\u201d This is not proper language for true children...",

I came to Christ at a Billy Graham Los Angeles Crusade in the 1960's. While completing my Bachelor of Science degree in Business Administration at Cal Poly Pomona, I sensed the call of God on my life to follow Jesus Christ completely and possibly forget business and prepare for the ministry.. Soon after that I met Alan Redpath who invited me and my wife Jean to England, where we attended Capernwray Bible School. Upon returning to the United States, I continued my studies at Talbot Seminary in La Mirada, California.\r\nEarly in my ministry, I served for four years as an assistant pastor to Chuck Smith at Calvary Chapel of Costa Mesa, California. Next Jean and I moved to Lake Arrowhead where we planted and pastored Calvary Chapel of Lake Arrowhead. During those years I founded Calvary Chapel Bible College in nearby Twin Peaks at the Calvary Chapel Conference Center (The college is now located in Murrieta Hot Springs). Sensing the Lord's direction to move on, we then pioneered and pastored another Calvary Chapel in Redlands, California, for eleven years. In 1991, we again, still having that pioneering heart, moved to San Jose with the heart to plant a number of churches in the Bay Area. There are now eight fellowships that have grown out of Calvary Chapel of San Jose. In September 2002, we responded to a request from Chuck Smith to return to Calvary Chapel of Costa Mesa to serve as an assistant. And, in 2004 we took to the leadership of Calvary Chapel of Laguna Beach to help guide it through a difficult time. That work being completed, we have now responded to a long time desire to step out and serve the churches and schools and missionaries that we love so much around the world. Which brings us now to Calvary Way Ministries.",

Brother Jim Cymbala was called into ministry without formal training in Brooklyn, New York to pastor a small gathering. God showed him the great need of prayer and depending on the work of the Holy Spirit in the ministry. God blessed and grew the brooklyn tabernacle to a large church of thousands because of this reliance.\r\n\r\nThe burden of his ministry is to show the vital need for prayer, deependence on God and that God uses the weak and lowly to build His kingdom. He has written many books including the best-selling: \"Fresh Wind, Fresh Fire\" and his newer book \"Spirit Rising\" speaking of the neglected work of the Holy Spirit in our churches these days.",
