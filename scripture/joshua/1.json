            "description": "Joshua means minister. The word minister means servant. Jesus said if anyone wants to be chief among you he must become a servant to all. Joshua was Moses personal servant. After the death of Moses God elevated him from Moses servant to the head of Israel. This is always the process of God. If we are faithful with the little things then He will allow us to be entrusted with bigger things. If we have not been faithful with worldly possessions of family how can we be entrusted with the spiritual riches. The most important ministries are ones that cannot been seen and what great rewards for ministries of intercessory prayer. We are all called by God to be full time ministry serving the Lord, whatever we do in word or deed we need to do it unto the Lord. We need to get away from that idea that the minister is someone especially holy or above the others. As a minister we are actually a servant and its Gods calling. The name Joshua was given by Moses which means Salvation, and after Moses renamed His name to mean: Jehovah is Salvation. In Joshua is an very interesting type of Christ.",

            "description": "Dr. Thompson begins by recounting events from a recent trip, stressing the eagerness for youth to embrace what God is doing, as opposed to the reluctance of many of the adults. He takes time to elaborate on Psalm 1:1, quickly addresses \u201cunconditional love,\u201d and then discusses the Army of the Lord. All of this is within the context of Joshua 1, and the transition from Moses to Joshua. This sermon is much more practical than it sounds. (1 hr 7 min 9 sec)",

JOSHUA was very highly favored in the matter of promises. The promises given him by God were broadly comprehensive and exceedingly encouraging. But Joshua was not therefore to say within himself, \u201cThese covenant engagements will surely be fulfilled, and I may therefore sit still and do nothing.\u201d On the contrary, because God had decreed that the land should be conquered, Joshua was to be diligent to lead the people onward to battle. He was not to use the promise as a couch upon which his indolence might luxuriate, but as a girdle wherewith to gird up his loins for future activity. As a spur to energy, let us always regard the gracious promises of our God. We should sin against him most ungratefully and detestably were we to say within ourselves, \u201cGod will not desert his people; therefore let us venture into sin;\u201d and we are almost equally wicked if we whisper in our own minds,\u201d God will assuredly fulfill his own decrees, and give the souls of his redeemed as a reward to his Son Jesus. therefore let us do nothing, and refrain altogether from zealous Christian service.\u201d This is not proper language for true children...",
