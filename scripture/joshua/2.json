The necessary truth of God\u2019s judgment and an inescapable requirement of true repentance for true faith unto salvation, are at the heart of the answer. This message relates the Holocaust to the historical rejection of God. A vital and challenging message for the Jewish people and the Church given at the national Charismatic Conference at Kansas City in 1977 as a historic event!",

He was radically converted by reading the New Testament. God used him to have a powerful prophetic insight into the end-times and the coming suffering of the jewish people before the great accepting of Jesus as Messiah. His eschatological insight is a very needful truth to be realized in the body of Christ. \r\n\r\nArt was a prophetic voice insofar as he called his listeners to purposes in God that would affect both time and eternity, purposes that had to do with the glory of God in the Church.   Frequently, his messages called the Church to an awareness of the Last Days [End-times] in such a way that made that time seem imminent and at the door.",
