This message is a must hear for all Christian leaders who find that they are ministering in difficult days. In it, Dr. Wiersbe uncovers four wonderful discoveries (principles) that will help to refocus and encourage God\u2019s leaders as they labor in the work of the Lord. God used this message to call me into the ministry and set me in the right path from the beginning. The Holy Spirit still reminds me of what He said to me through this sermon to this very day.",
