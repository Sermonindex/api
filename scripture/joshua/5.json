            "description": "This message was preached at the annual Pastor\u2019s Conference, First Baptist Church Jacksonville, Florida, February 2, 1998. This message is a must hear for all Christian leaders who find that they are ministering in difficult days. In it, Dr. Wiersbe uncovers four wonderful discoveries (principles) that will help to refocus and encourage God\u2019s leaders as they labor in the work of the Lord. God used this message to call me into the ministry and set me in the right path from the beginning. The Holy Spirit still reminds me of what He said to me through this sermon to this very day.",

Joshua's encounter with the Captain of the Lord's hosts is an illustration that 1) God fights for God, and 2) He has come to take over.  Just as the battle is the Lord's, so too the victory is the Lord's.",
