When Joshua was given instruction from God by a heavenly host to take down the walls of Jericho with a mighty shout & spare none except for Rahab & her household, it was the Israelite\u2019s faith in God\u2019s plan that made it a success, not the ark by itself.",

Joshua's encounter with the Captain of the Lord's hosts is an illustration that 1) God fights for God, and 2) He has come to take over.  Just as the battle is the Lord's, so too the victory is the Lord's.",
