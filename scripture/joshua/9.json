            "description": "The kings of Canaan thought the only hope to stop the armies of Israel was that they should all band their armies together against them in a sort of collation. The gibonites knew their only hope of making a covenant was to do it in disguise. They came to the camp of Israel in disguise to make peace with you, they brought moldy bread and clothes to make a peace treaty. Israel did not inquire of the Lord but rather make the pack with them and were deceived. This was the second mistake of Joshua as an army leader and the people began to murmur against Him. It was a fault of not relying on God. It was his failure to pray also at EI so that the troops were killed. He should have sought the council of God, inquiring not of the Lord. How many times we find ourselves in ungodly situations if we not only sought Gods guidance first. But of course we cry out to God before that but why don\u2019t we first seek God and escape from failing into these situations.",

He has raised up many pastors who are a part of the Calvary Chapel movement now and where he pastors the large Costa Mesa church in California.\r\n\r\nThe Calvary Chapel movement is based of simple principles that Chuck Smith taught over the years such as: The priority of agape love, Simple fellowship amongst the saints, the breaking of bread, the teaching of God's word chapter by chapter and verse by verse. And lastly and most importantly the principle not by might nor by power but by my spirit saith the Lord.",

Satan uses masks to disguise true intentions. Let's be vigilant, walk close to God and read His word.  A powerful word that will set us free and encourage us to walk in victory with our Lord.",

Brother Jim Cymbala was called into ministry without formal training in Brooklyn, New York to pastor a small gathering. God showed him the great need of prayer and depending on the work of the Holy Spirit in the ministry. God blessed and grew the brooklyn tabernacle to a large church of thousands because of this reliance.\r\n\r\nThe burden of his ministry is to show the vital need for prayer, deependence on God and that God uses the weak and lowly to build His kingdom. He has written many books including the best-selling: \"Fresh Wind, Fresh Fire\" and his newer book \"Spirit Rising\" speaking of the neglected work of the Holy Spirit in our churches these days.",
