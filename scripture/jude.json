Jude shows how evil works are the result of apostacy just a James shows that true good works are the result of true faith. Interestingly the name Jude means Judas, which of course is a name synonymous with treachory and apostacy.  From the first few verses we discover that Jude was the brother of James and most likely the brother of Jesus Himself, we also find that he had originally intended to write an encouraging letter but was constrained by the Holy Spirit to exhort his bretheren to contend for the faith.  He had to do this because apostates had crept into the church of Jesus and were denying the foundational doctrines of the Lord.",

We see the typology associated with the wilderness wanderings, such as Israel's baptism in their corssing the Red Sea, the manna they ate was the bread of life and the Rock they drank from was Christ.  When the people loathed the bread they were attacked by snakes and had to look upon a brass serpent on a cross which Jesus Himself said was type of Him.

In Genesis 6 the scripture recalls a period in history when the 'sons of God' which in OT times was always translated 'angels' married human women and had monsterous children known as the Nephilim or 'fallen ones'.  He states that this was the sin of the angels that lead to them being imprissoned and probably to the flood in orer to completely destroy the monsterous offspring.  Intersting stuff.",

The sin of Sodom was the condoning of such widespread and abominable sin within the cities gates, which was not only homosexuality.  Back in Genesis, Abraham had interceeded for the cities and the Lord had been merciful but the only people to be delivered from the cities was Lot and his family although hid wife of course did not survive due to her emotional ties to the cities.  It is interesting that Jude mentions this incident in a letter about apostacy as this means that Sodom knew the truth and turned from it, becuase the truth is revealed to all of through creation itself.  So these apostates act as they want, deny authority and speak evil of dignities.",

From other scriptures we learn that Michael the archangel is almost always associated with the nation of Israel and this leads Dr Missler into the idea that the dispute was to foil the Lord's plan regarding the two witnesses in Revelation 11, as Moses is believed to be one of the witnesses as his ministry was interupted, as was Elijah's, the other witness.  Interestingly even when Michael was on a mission from the Lord doing His will, he doesn't rebuke Satan directly but rebukes him in the name of the Lord.  This is the most extreme example of not being disrespectful to dignities, a sin we we are so often guilty of.",

            "description": "Cain, Balaam and Korah are three Old Testament examples that Jude uses to show apostacy.  Cain was a farmer where as Abel was a shepherd, interestingly originally mankind did not eat meat till after the flood and so the sheep were most likely for sacrificial purposes.  Cain thus offered the works of his own hands which told God that His way was not good enough in Cains eyes and this was blasphemy.  Balaam was a prophet who was paid to curse Israel, but the Lord would not allow him to prophecy against His people so Balaam counselled Balak in how to get Israel to sin with the daughters of Moab.  Korah rejected the mediator between God and the people of God who was at the time Moses, this was rejection in type of the Lord Jesus, which came with penalty of Korah and all those who rebelled with him going down into Sheol alive.  From what happened to these three we see the high price of apostacy.",

            "description": "Enoch was the first prophet that we know of from the scripture, but why is he mentioned in an epistle about apostacy?  Because this is exactly what Enoch prophesied against, Enoch was given a reveltaion from God that caused him to name his son Methuselah (whose name means 'when he dies judgement shall be sent'), no wonder Enoch walked with God after Methusaleh was born.  And yet Methuselah is a model of the Lord's grace because he is oldest man in the scripture. Interestingly some rabinical sources claim that Methuselah died one week before the flood, just when Noah entered into the Ark, we do know from the scripture that Methuselah died in the same year as the flood.  Enoch confronted the apostates of his day and some signs of apostacy are murmering, just as Israel did at the beginning of Jude, complaining as the angels did, and going after their own lusts just as Sodom and Gomorah did.",

By saying they are soulish and natural and that do not have the Spirit, thus they are unsaved and unable to discern the truth of God.  Jude finishes his letter with an exhortation to the believers to build up their faith and ensure they remain kept in the love of God.  Jude exhorts different types of witnessing, with love and with fear, and finishes his epistle with a proclamation as to the keeping power of God, who is not only able to keep us from falling but also able to present us fautless on that final day, praise be to God.",

Stephen Kaung is a Chinese Chrisitan speaker and writer, and now living in Richmond, Virgina. At an early age was converted to Christianity and was active in the Methodist Church in China, with home his father was a minister. He first met watchman need in the early 1930's and joined Nee's indigenous christian work full-time, working with him until 1949 when he left China and became involved with Christian work in other ares of the Far East.\r\n\r\nStephen Kaung worked very closely with T Austin-Sparks until his death in 1972. His burden has been to allow a testimony of the Lord in the local assembly, and to help the saints see the great importance of the Church as God intended it.

Surrounded as his readers were by moral corruption and apostacizing influences, the author urges them to \"contend for the faith\" (3), and in a closing benediction he commends them to the One \"who is able to keep you from falling\" (24).

Many other things we might give thee warning of (gentle Reader) if we had not exceeded the measure of a Preface already. It remaineth, that we commend thee to God, and to the Spirit of his grace, which is able to build further than we can ask or think. He removeth the scales from our eyes, the vail from our hearts, opening our wits that we may understand his word, enlarging our hearts, yea correcting our affections, that we may love it to the end. Ye are brought unto fountains of living water which ye digged not; do not cast earth into them with the Philistines, neither prefer broken pits before them with the wicked Jews. [Gen 26:15. Jer 2:13.] Others have laboured, and you may enter into their labours; O receive not so great things in vain, O despise not so great salvation! Be not like swine to tread under foot so precious things, neither yet like dogs to tear and abuse holy things. Say not to our Saviour with the Gergesites, Depart out of our coast [Matt 8:34]; neither yet with Esau sell your birthright for a mess of pottage [Heb 12:16]. If light be come into the world, love not darkness more than light; if food, if clothing be offered, go not naked, starve not yourselves. Remember the advice of Nazianzene, \"It is a grievous thing\" (or dangerous) \"to neglect a great fair, and to seek to make markets afterwards:\" also the encouragement of S. Chrysostom, \"It is altogether impossible, that he that is sober\" (and watchful) \"should at any time be neglected:\" [S. Chrysost. in epist. ad Rom. cap. 14. oral. 26.]\r\nLastly, the admonition and menacing of S. Augustine, \"They that despise God's will inviting them, shall feel God's will taking vengeance of them.\" [S. August. ad artic. sibi falso object. Artic. 16.] It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God; [Heb 10:31] but a blessed thing it is, and will bring us to everlasting blessedness in the end, when God speaketh unto us, to hearken; when he setteth his word before us, to read it; when he stretcheth out his hand and calleth, to answer, Here am I, here we are to do thy will, O God. The Lord work a care and conscience in us to know him and serve him, that we may be acknowledged of him at the appearing of our Lord Jesus Christ, to whom with the holy Ghost, be all praise and thanksgiving. Amen.",
