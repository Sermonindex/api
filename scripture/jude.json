Jude shows how evil works are the result of apostacy just a James shows that true good works are the result of true faith. Interestingly the name Jude means Judas, which of course is a name synonymous with treachory and apostacy.  From the first few verses we discover that Jude was the brother of James and most likely the brother of Jesus Himself, we also find that he had originally intended to write an encouraging letter but was constrained by the Holy Spirit to exhort his bretheren to contend for the faith.  He had to do this because apostates had crept into the church of Jesus and were denying the foundational doctrines of the Lord.",

We see the typology associated with the wilderness wanderings, such as Israel's baptism in their corssing the Red Sea, the manna they ate was the bread of life and the Rock they drank from was Christ.  When the people loathed the bread they were attacked by snakes and had to look upon a brass serpent on a cross which Jesus Himself said was type of Him.  Dr Missler also discusses 'Kingdom Now' or 'Dominion' theology which tries to set up the Kingdom of God on earth which of course will not happen until the Lord returns.",

Dr Missler puts forward that demons are not fallen angels as demons seem to require a host body where as angels can appear in their own bodies.  In Genesis 6 the scripture recalls a period in history when the 'sons of God' which in OT times was always translated 'angels' married human women and had monsterous children known as the Nephilim or 'fallen ones'.  He states that this was the sin of the angels that lead to them being imprissoned and probably to the flood in orer to completely destroy the monsterous offspring.  Intersting stuff.",

The sin of Sodom was the condoning of such widespread and abominable sin within the cities gates, which was not only homosexuality.  Back in Genesis, Abraham had interceeded for the cities and the Lord had been merciful but the only people to be delivered from the cities was Lot and his family although hid wife of course did not survive due to her emotional ties to the cities.  It is interesting that Jude mentions this incident in a letter about apostacy as this means that Sodom knew the truth and turned from it, becuase the truth is revealed to all of through creation itself.  So these apostates act as they want, deny authority and speak evil of dignities.",

From other scriptures we learn that Michael the archangel is almost always associated with the nation of Israel and this leads Dr Missler into the idea that the dispute was to foil the Lord's plan regarding the two witnesses in Revelation 11, as Moses is believed to be one of the witnesses as his ministry was interupted, as was Elijah's, the other witness.  Interestingly even when Michael was on a mission from the Lord doing His will, he doesn't rebuke Satan directly but rebukes him in the name of the Lord.  This is the most extreme example of not being disrespectful to dignities, a sin we we are so often guilty of.",

Cain was a farmer where as Abel was a shepherd, interestingly originally mankind did not eat meat till after the flood and so the sheep were most likely for sacrificial purposes.  Cain thus offered the works of his own hands which told God that His way was not good enough in Cains eyes and this was blasphemy.  Balaam was a prophet who was paid to curse Israel, but the Lord would not allow him to prophecy against His people so Balaam counselled Balak in how to get Israel to sin with the daughters of Moab.  Korah rejected the mediator between God and the people of God who was at the time Moses, this was rejection in type of the Lord Jesus, which came with penalty of Korah and all those who rebelled with him going down into Sheol alive.  From what happened to these three we see the high price of apostacy.",

Because this is exactly what Enoch prophesied against, Enoch was given a reveltaion from God that caused him to name his son Methuselah (whose name means 'when he dies judgement shall be sent'), no wonder Enoch walked with God after Methusaleh was born.  And yet Methuselah is a model of the Lord's grace because he is oldest man in the scripture. Interestingly some rabinical sources claim that Methuselah died one week before the flood, just when Noah entered into the Ark, we do know from the scripture that Methuselah died in the same year as the flood.  Enoch confronted the apostates of his day and some signs of apostacy are murmering, just as Israel did at the beginning of Jude, complaining as the angels did, and going after their own lusts just as Sodom and Gomorah did.",

Jude finishes his letter with an exhortation to the believers to build up their faith and ensure they remain kept in the love of God.
