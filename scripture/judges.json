            "description": "The book of Judges takes up the next period of Israel\u2019s history after Joshua. There were 12 judges that were in a sort of leadership over Israel, they were the beginnings of what would be a king for Israel. Samuel was the last judge that anointed the king Saul. When they had times which was blessed from war they would start to fall into apostasy and worship other Gods and idols. They turned their backs on God and then come back to God and then go back. They had a failure of consistency with honoring and following God. The command of God was to utterly drive out all the inhabitants of the promised land. But Israel tried to rationally think out ways to comprise Gods will. God has ordered something we need to follow even if it does not seem to be for our best interest. It often times seems we can think of better ways to do things then God, sometimes Gods timing and plans are different then ours and doesn\u2019t make sense with us. God always knows what He is talking about and knows why. God in all things works for the good of those that belong to Him.",

            "description": "The story of Samson begins in chapter 13 of judges. Samson judged Israel for 20 years. The problem with Samson was him going down into the camp of the enemy. If we go into situations that are not suitable then we are asking to be defiled and brought into sin. Samson carried the gates of the city 20 miles when they tried to ambush them. You can play with fire but ultimately you will be burned. If you think you are getting by with your passions and desires watch out because it will catch up with you. Women were the failing point of Samson he went into the enemies camp to see a women which was wrong and immoral but the anointed of God did not leave him. Delilah was a deceiver and it was obvious to Samson that she was wanting him to be caught by the philistines. Samson is guilty of an comprise which is always dangerous, he should have said it is none of your business. But he slowly gets closer to the truth to finally talking about his hair. There are times when people have made a special commitment to God. And we make our determination we are really going to live our life for God. Then we compromise when we receive an invitation and are not totally honest.. we need to be honest for the reason why.",

            "description": "This chapter tells us of the moral condition of Israel when it was back at Joshua. This part of the book of Judges goes back to some of the moral decay that goes on during the time of the judges. The moral corruptness that existed with the people of God when they were not fully committed the Lord. Everyone was doing what was right in their own eyes. This is happening in our day in society if it feels right do it. This is a chaotic and anarchy time in Israel where nobody was really following God or the Law of God. Thus it is always a mark of spiritual detoriation when we start to rely on images and idols of God. It does not mean we have forsaken God but rather it is something that shows how our relationship with the living God is waning. The Levite is becoming a professional religionist now for the 10 shekels and a shirt. Paul speaks of the error in the New Testament that godliness is a means of gain. He said this was an evil doctrine and from such depart, Micah feel into this error believing that God would do him good.",

Gideon then asked the men for his share of the victory and the spoils. He received 1700 shekels of gold ear rings, and he made an gold ephod (robe). And people started to come and worship it and thus it became a snare in Israel. When Gideon saw how people were revering the gold ephod he did not destroy it but left it. This was a major fault of Gideon. Soon after Gideon was dead they went whoring after Baal the god. Jesus said to people that taught false things that it would be better for them to have a milestone around their necks and thrown in the sea. Ambilech was a lot killed with an milestone. They have hewn out cisterns that cannot hold water, and thus the children of Israel was continually turning from God and served idols. This is the sixth recorded time that they forsook God for idols.",

A spiritual crisis during this period\u2014as he described two decades later in what is probably his best-known recorded teaching, \"Ten Shekels and a Shirt\"--left Reidhead with the conviction that much of evangelicalism had adopted utilitarian and humanistic philosophies contradictory to Biblical teaching. The end of all being, he came to believe, was not the happiness of man, but the glorification of God. This theme would recur throughout his later teaching.\r\n\r\nSince Mr. Reidhead's death in 1992, Bible Teaching Ministries, Inc. continues under the leadership of his wife, Marjorie, and daughter, Virginia Teitt, a dedicated Board, and the many people who have donated time and talent after being changed by God\u2019s Word through this message.
