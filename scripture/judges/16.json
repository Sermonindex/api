            "description": "March 30, 2008 - Satan's plan for every true believer in Christ is to take away our spiritual vision and move us into a profitless labor where there is no outflow of the supernatural life. If our separation to God for the purpose of freeing others from oppression is willfully and unwittingly forfeited than we will become weak in the hands of the enemy. We are called to be separated unto God and empowered by the Spirit of God for the sake of every lost soul. If we would know the Lord's strength we must give Him our ALL and embrace HIS plan for our life.",

In order to finish our lives in victory we have to be doing the work of God. The enemy is after the strength of God in us. The devil knows the potential of one person that rises up and cries out to the Holy Spirit to destroy the works of darkness in our lives. The Spirit of God will come upon us and expand us, we will not be defeated with repeated failure. God promises us absolute deliverance",

            "description": "This is not what you think. This message is a real treat and eye-opener. So, be sure to have a pen and paper handy to jot down the other scriptures. When Samson stood captive in the presence of the Philistines and they mocked and laughed at him, now blind, and seemingly defeated, they had no idea they were about to die. Today many Christians are in positions where the enemy of their souls taunts and ridicules them, but like Samson, we have the Source of power we need to overcome. This is an excellent message on spiritual warfare and victory.",
