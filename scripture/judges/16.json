If our separation to God for the purpose of freeing others from oppression is willfully and unwittingly forfeited than we will become weak in the hands of the enemy. We are called to be separated unto God and empowered by the Spirit of God for the sake of every lost soul. If we would know the Lord's strength we must give Him our ALL and embrace HIS plan for our life.",

When Samson stood captive in the presence of the Philistines and they mocked and laughed at him, now blind, and seemingly defeated, they had no idea they were about to die. Today many Christians are in positions where the enemy of their souls taunts and ridicules them, but like Samson, we have the Source of power we need to overcome. This is an excellent message on spiritual warfare and victory.",
