            "description": "This chapter tells us of the moral condition of Israel when it was back at Joshua. This part of the book of Judges goes back to some of the moral decay that goes on during the time of the judges. The moral corruptness that existed with the people of God when they were not fully committed the Lord. Everyone was doing what was right in their own eyes. This is happening in our day in society if it feels right do it. This is a chaotic and anarchy time in Israel where nobody was really following God or the Law of God. Thus it is always a mark of spiritual detoriation when we start to rely on images and idols of God. It does not mean we have forsaken God but rather it is something that shows how our relationship with the living God is waning. The Levite is becoming a professional religionist now for the 10 shekels and a shirt. Paul speaks of the error in the New Testament that godliness is a means of gain. He said this was an evil doctrine and from such depart, Micah feel into this error believing that God would do him good.",

He has raised up many pastors who are a part of the Calvary Chapel movement now and where he pastors the large Costa Mesa church in California.\r\n\r\nThe Calvary Chapel movement is based of simple principles that Chuck Smith taught over the years such as: The priority of agape love, Simple fellowship amongst the saints, the breaking of bread, the teaching of God's word chapter by chapter and verse by verse. And lastly and most importantly the principle not by might nor by power but by my spirit saith the Lord.",

Was a Christian missionary, teacher, writer, and advocate of economic development in impoverished nations. A spiritual crisis during this period\u2014as he described two decades later in what is probably his best-known recorded teaching, \"Ten Shekels and a Shirt\"--left Reidhead with the conviction that much of evangelicalism had adopted utilitarian and humanistic philosophies contradictory to Biblical teaching. The end of all being, he came to believe, was not the happiness of man, but the glorification of God. This theme would recur throughout his later teaching.\r\n\r\nSince Mr. Reidhead's death in 1992, Bible Teaching Ministries, Inc. continues under the leadership of his wife, Marjorie, and daughter, Virginia Teitt, a dedicated Board, and the many people who have donated time and talent after being changed by God\u2019s Word through this message.
