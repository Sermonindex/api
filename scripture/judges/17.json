            "description": "This chapter tells us of the moral condition of Israel when it was back at Joshua. This part of the book of Judges goes back to some of the moral decay that goes on during the time of the judges. The moral corruptness that existed with the people of God when they were not fully committed the Lord. Everyone was doing what was right in their own eyes. This is happening in our day in society if it feels right do it. This is a chaotic and anarchy time in Israel where nobody was really following God or the Law of God. Thus it is always a mark of spiritual detoriation when we start to rely on images and idols of God. It does not mean we have forsaken God but rather it is something that shows how our relationship with the living God is waning. The Levite is becoming a professional religionist now for the 10 shekels and a shirt. Paul speaks of the error in the New Testament that godliness is a means of gain. He said this was an evil doctrine and from such depart, Micah feel into this error believing that God would do him good.",
