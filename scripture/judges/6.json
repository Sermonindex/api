Christ must become not one of many prominent things (even good things like missions, ministry, family, local church) but preeminent--the one and only.  And if you do, like Gideon, expect all kinds of opposition, as you become identified with Christ outside the camp and receive a new name: \"Baal fighter\".",

God needs some people whom he can use who want to go all the way with him but they must stay small, dependent on God in their own sight and never touch his glory.
