If you take lightly the Lord\u2019s presence and if you begin to dabble in and out of obedience and disobedience so that you develop a warped sense of what it means to walk with Him \u2013 God said He will have a quarrel with us. The scripture says that two cannot walk together unless they agree. God is not required to agree with us but we are required to agree with Him.",
