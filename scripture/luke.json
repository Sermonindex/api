This is amazingly characteristic of the abundance with which the Lord gives to His people, Daniel has been asking the Lord to show mercy to the nation of Israel yet the Lord does that and more, He answers Daniel's prayer but goes so much further.  Gabriel reveals to Daniel that there will be a period of 490 years that will concern the Jews and particularly the city of Jerusalem.  The prophecy began to be fulfilled in 445BC at the decree of Cyrus to rebuild the city of Jerusalem.  483 Jewish years (360 days) later was the exact that the Lord Jesus rode into Jerusalem on the donkey, but as predicted the Messiah was executed and the temple destoyed.  So we await the fulfillment of Daniels 70th week, when the Antichrist will confirm a covenant with the jews, his people destroyed the temple and Jerusalem before he even came to the world, many believe he will probably be European.",

Yet it also was a \"non-triumphal\" entry, as evidenced by His appearing on a humble donkey and His anguished weeping over the city.",

Their cry to go and make new disciples is backed up with their very lives. In many cases if they speak to the wrong person about Jesus, they face prison, torture and even death. The task of sharing the Gospel is for every Christian, even if they give their life as a martyr. Chinese Christians teach us that when their seed (their life) has gone into the ground and died it will multiply and produce much more fruit.544 With their blood new growth is coming. The seed, their body that died now produces 100 fold, 1000 fold or even more.",

The essence of God's forgiveness is that he absorbs the debt of our sinfulness upon Himself in Jesus Christ, rather than requiring us to repay the debt through our moral efforts. Because God sees us for who we are in Jesus and not who we are as sinners, we are empowered to become a community that doesn't bear grudges, belittle those who have hurt us, or force people to carry the sins of their past with them forever.",

His sacrificial commitment, farsightedness and aptitude to perceive helped him to lead a life of unhindered devotion to serve Christ and His church. K.P.

He will take away all things that we believe He has given us, when in reality He never did. In this place God will deal with all that has captivated our heart and would hinder His life from being lived through us. In the wilderness the natural becomes supernatural and we are brought back to a right perspective. When we get through this deep dealing of God we are enabled to make the choice to be poured out for Jesus so that others can be grafted into His power and lineage.

Hear then, O ye that are strangers to the truth as it is in Jesus \u00e2\u20ac\u201d hear then the message that I have to bring you. Ye have fallen, fallen in your father Adam; ye have fallen also in yourselves, by your daily sin and your constant iniquity; you have provoked the anger of the Most High; and as assuredly as you have sinned, so certainly must God punish you if you persevere in your iniquity, for the Lord is a God of justice, and will by no means spare the guilty. But have you not heard, hath it not long been spoken in your ears, that God, in his infinite mercy, has devised a way whereby, without any infringement upon his honor, he can have mercy upon you, the guilty and the undeserving? To you I speak; and my voice is unto you, O sons of men; Jesus Christ, very God of very God, hath descended from heaven, and was made in the likeness of sinful flesh. Begotten of the Holy Ghost, he was born of the Virgin Mary; he lived in this world a life of exemplary holiness, and of the deepest suffering, till at last he gave himself up to die for our sins, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153the just for the unjust, to bring us to God.'...",

She speaks about the revival in China, and how teenage girls leave their homes and walk from village to village sharing Jesus. They come back two years later and multitudes have accepted Christ. These girls have never been to a seminar or a worship service. They simply give everything they have away. Jackie also witnesses about brothers and sisters coming out of decades in prison with broken bodies many times, but rejoicing and shining in their Saviour. She emphasizes that the revival in China is not facilitated by visual aids, life changing tapes, videos of the month or Christian magazines. It comes through the Holy Spirit using \"just a few people who aren't very educated, without microphones, who loved their lives not unto death - that's it.\" In this way, God has chosen the foolish things of the world to shame the wise (1 Corinthians 1:26-27). Jesus came to preach the good news to the poor (Luke 4:18). Jackie explains how the poor are often able to hear the gospel much quicker than an educated person, because they can hear spiritually. This is why the poor in spirit are blessed (Matthew 5:3). Jackie Pullinger emphasizes that men and women are saved through the Spirit of God, not through man's reasoning. She concludes with a call to die and a profound challenge: \"His glory will fall if you go out with nothing except a broken heart and some precious seed, and I suppose we have all got that.\"",

I came to Christ at a Billy Graham Los Angeles Crusade in the 1960's. While completing my Bachelor of Science degree in Business Administration at Cal Poly Pomona, I sensed the call of God on my life to follow Jesus Christ completely and possibly forget business and prepare for the ministry.. Soon after that I met Alan Redpath who invited me and my wife Jean to England, where we attended Capernwray Bible School. Upon returning to the United States, I continued my studies at Talbot Seminary in La Mirada, California.\r\nEarly in my ministry, I served for four years as an assistant pastor to Chuck Smith at Calvary Chapel of Costa Mesa, California. Next Jean and I moved to Lake Arrowhead where we planted and pastored Calvary Chapel of Lake Arrowhead. During those years I founded Calvary Chapel Bible College in nearby Twin Peaks at the Calvary Chapel Conference Center (The college is now located in Murrieta Hot Springs). Sensing the Lord's direction to move on, we then pioneered and pastored another Calvary Chapel in Redlands, California, for eleven years. In 1991, we again, still having that pioneering heart, moved to San Jose with the heart to plant a number of churches in the Bay Area. There are now eight fellowships that have grown out of Calvary Chapel of San Jose. In September 2002, we responded to a request from Chuck Smith to return to Calvary Chapel of Costa Mesa to serve as an assistant. And, in 2004 we took to the leadership of Calvary Chapel of Laguna Beach to help guide it through a difficult time. That work being completed, we have now responded to a long time desire to step out and serve the churches and schools and missionaries that we love so much around the world. Which brings us now to Calvary Way Ministries.",

The tax collectors in Jesus\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 day collected the tax for the government of the day, the Roman government. Nobody liked them. When they taxed people, they would add to the cost for their own pocket. They were thieves, charging more than the government required. And even today there are such people in the world who require bribes for their work. These tax collectors were therefore despised. And Jesus was sitting with them and ate with them! We must be careful interpreting this lest we think that Jesus loves a person that is corrupt and steals from others. And the sinners with whom Jesus ate would include those who divorce, adulterers, drunkards, blasphemers of God, very evil people.",

Although Elizabeth was much older than Mary they could share deep spiritual things with one another. In spiritual matters, age does not matter; only one's spiritual state is important. It is a blessing when one's friend walks with God. Then people are united because of the things of God and can bear one another's burdens. However, be careful not to unite with others in evil, like Ananias and Sapphira (Acts 5). Although Mary was only a teenager, she delighted herself in the things of God. She was full of joy because God has finally sent the promised Messiah Who would bruise the serpent's head and bring forgiveness and true liberty. She hid God's words in her heart. The world and the things of the world lost its value, because heaven filled her heart.",

For over 70 years, the church was blessed and challenged by the prophetic ministry of Vance Havner. His style and burden was prophetic similar to the ministry of A.W. Tozer calling the Church to revival. His influence extended to a national level, but Dr. Havner's approach was always to minister where God directed, regardless of the size of the church.  His appeal and influence transcended denominational lines, and he spoke to many different groups of people.\r\n\r\nThroughout his ministry, Vance Havner lived and preached that a Christian should should exhibit faithfulness to Jesus in all areas of life.  He taught that the Christian should attend to, \"the outliving of the inliving Christ.\"  Havner wrote, \"To some, Christianity is an argument.  To many, it is a performance.  To a few, it is an experience.\"",

His appeal and influence transcended denominational lines, and he spoke to many different groups of people.\r\n\r\nThroughout his ministry, Vance Havner lived and preached that a Christian should should exhibit faithfulness to Jesus in all areas of life.  He taught that the Christian should attend to, \"the outliving of the inliving Christ.\"  Havner wrote, \"To some, Christianity is an argument.  To many, it is a performance.

But here Jesus speaks of denying oneself and taking up the cross, as if it were two different things. In fact, taking up your cross involves all tree of the points above. What does God say to you personally when He commands you to take up your cross daily? You cannot say that Christ has done everything and you needn't do anything anymore. Here is something for you to do. In Roman times it was a very difficult task to carry a heavy, rugged, wooden cross. Jesus doesn't say that He will take and carry your cross for you, but commands you to take up your cross daily and follow Him. Many people have their idea of what the Christian life is like, but it's as far away as the east is from the west from what Jesus commanded.",

Many other things we might give thee warning of (gentle Reader) if we had not exceeded the measure of a Preface already. It remaineth, that we commend thee to God, and to the Spirit of his grace, which is able to build further than we can ask or think. He removeth the scales from our eyes, the vail from our hearts, opening our wits that we may understand his word, enlarging our hearts, yea correcting our affections, that we may love it to the end. Ye are brought unto fountains of living water which ye digged not; do not cast earth into them with the Philistines, neither prefer broken pits before them with the wicked Jews. [Gen 26:15. Jer 2:13.] Others have laboured, and you may enter into their labours; O receive not so great things in vain, O despise not so great salvation! Be not like swine to tread under foot so precious things, neither yet like dogs to tear and abuse holy things. Say not to our Saviour with the Gergesites, Depart out of our coast [Matt 8:34]; neither yet with Esau sell your birthright for a mess of pottage [Heb 12:16]. If light be come into the world, love not darkness more than light; if food, if clothing be offered, go not naked, starve not yourselves. Remember the advice of Nazianzene, \"It is a grievous thing\" (or dangerous) \"to neglect a great fair, and to seek to make markets afterwards:\" also the encouragement of S. Chrysostom, \"It is altogether impossible, that he that is sober\" (and watchful) \"should at any time be neglected:\" [S. Chrysost. in epist. ad Rom. cap. 14. oral. 26.]\r\nLastly, the admonition and menacing of S. Augustine, \"They that despise God's will inviting them, shall feel God's will taking vengeance of them.\" [S. August. ad artic. sibi falso object. Artic. 16.] It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God; [Heb 10:31] but a blessed thing it is, and will bring us to everlasting blessedness in the end, when God speaketh unto us, to hearken; when he setteth his word before us, to read it; when he stretcheth out his hand and calleth, to answer, Here am I, here we are to do thy will, O God. The Lord work a care and conscience in us to know him and serve him, that we may be acknowledged of him at the appearing of our Lord Jesus Christ, to whom with the holy Ghost, be all praise and thanksgiving.

From the garden on through the resurrection circumstances revealed.  No more were they boasting of their capacity to be the greatest.  During the dark night of the crisis of the Christ, all was revealed.  It is in this that the Apostle Paul gloried, nothing other than the cross of Christ, for nothing else has the capacity to reveal what we are.   The sufferings of Christ, viewed with sincerity, will always beget personal revelation.  We must be apprehended by the cross.  If this is not the case, then we will be absolutely unable to serve God in any form of spiritual community.  Just like it was a suffering for Christ to display the truth of who he was, so also, our apprehension of the truth of what we are will be suffering.",

This message is preached in the concluding session at a conference. This forceful message over and over again poses the question: \"will you follow me?\" and then asks have we given Him our all? This sermon demands that you count the cost of true discipleship with Jesus Christ. Are we willing to agree to the demands of discipleship: \"No refusual, no rival, no retreat, I am ready Lord, cost what it will!\"",

Dr. Billy Graham called him \"the man who most influenced my ministry.\" He was a personal confidant of Graham. Olford was also a role model and friend to prominent pastors such as Charles Stanley and Adrian Rogers. He was a pioneer in Christian television programming with his show, Encounter, in New York. His Sunday morning sermons were also broadcast around the world on radio.[1] He was the Founder and Chairman of the Board of Olford Ministries International in Memphis, Tennessee which became The Stephen Olford Center at Union University. His authorized biography, Only One Life, was written by John Philipps.\r\nIn 1953, Dr. Stephen F. Olford's years of pastoral ministry began by serving the Duke Street Baptist Church in Richmond, Surrey England (1953\u20131959) and then the Calvary Baptist Church in New York City (1959\u20131973).[1] Olford systematized his method of expository preaching and formed a curriculum used to train preachers at the Olford Institute for Biblical Preaching in Memphis, Tennessee. Pastors and scholars migrated to the institute for inspiration and instruction that often resulted in upgraded pulpit ministries.",

He must have been, moreover, greatly depressed, and brought into a condition of extreme weakness by the agony of the night in Gethsemane, and by the scourgings and cruel mockings which he had endured all through the morning, from Caiaphas, Pilate, Herod, and the Praetorian guards. Yet neither the weakness of the past, nor the pain of the present, could prevent him from continuing in prayer. The lamb of God was silent to men, but he was not silent to God. Dumb as a sheep before her shearers, he had not a word to say in his own defense to man, but he continues in his heart crying unto his Father, and no pain and no weakness can silence his holy supplications. Beloved, what an example our Lord herein presents to us! Let us continue in prayer so long as our heart beats; let no excess of suffering drive us away from the throne of grace, but rather let it drive us closer to it. \u201cLong as they live should Christians pray, For only while they pray they live.\u201d To cease from prayer is to renounce the consolations which our case requires...",

We must come to the Lord with a WHOLE heart - and not TRY Him, but SERVE Him, because He is GOD. Many do not get through to God because they are seeking their own agenda, or their own personal well being rather than the purpose of Christ. The reason so many walk in confusion is because of this refusal to submit to God. Why do Christians not pray as they should? Are they not totally surrendered to following Jesus? Do they not understand the heart of God and his love for them? This unjust judge had authority in Luke 18 over this widow woman's adversary, and she knew her rights, and she did not give up. The devil accuses us, pointing out our faults, and God avenges us by giving us the very thing we lack, when we seek him for it. God delights in his children and will rise up to deliver them when they are under attack.  Another wonderful encouragement to prayer.",

It is the older brother syndrome, when service in the house of God becomes hard labor from an angry joyless heart. It is the Father that meets His children with love and mercy. God almighty will bring His sons and daughter back home and we need to be prepared to celebrate their home coming.",

On, October 17, 1971, God in His sovereignty came in revival. Without human means or explanation, the revival spread from church to church, community to community, city to city, and not long after from province to province. This has become known as the 1971 Canadian Revival movement.",

When the man  is found by the neighboring citizens, clothed and sitting at the feet of Jesus in his right mind, instead of rejoicing at his deliverance, they reject Jesus, and ask him to leave for they are unwilling to follow him if it means losing their pigs. Many are unwilling to trust their life to Jesus, and are holding back part of themselves, unwilling to surrender, having counted the cost and the price too high.

The Kingdom of God and the kingdom of the world, Coming to the house of the Lord with a seemingly holy devotion for God and leaving the House of the Lord and having the same devotion for the things of the world. This is the reason why there is such a powerless testimony and the church is becoming a non issue in this society. We cannot be devoted to the Lord and be devoted to the things that offend His holy name. God is calling His church to come outside the camp and come out of mixture and compromise to serve the Lord wholeheartedly. In every generation there has to be somebody that is willing to stand in the middle of the marketplace and bear the reproach of Jesus Christ.",

The Bible says that Jesus took upon Himself the form of a servant and in doing this He teaches us that heavens order is completely reversed from the world's order. The Word of God is performed in those whom have a servant's heart. Serving Christ and then serving others unlocks power and revelation. You may feel trampled, pounded, unappreciated and passed by but as a servant you have found the secret of spiritual strength! Take heed; the last will be first and the first will be last!",

The results told him that he was best suited for a career in ministry or in entertainment. At the time, David's future goal was to live in a log cabin in the wilderness and live off the land for the rest of his life. The Lord, however, had different plans for David Servant. God didn't intend for him to run away from the world, but rather to play a part in changing the world by building God's kingdom.

We best glorify Him by allowing that which is the deepest embodiment of His character to be manifested in and through our lives. There is a longing in every lost person we come in contact with to come back to their Creator. Are our lives a manifestation of the heart of God? When we encounter people that God sends our way do they see and hear Christ in us? The purest measure of success comes when there is a true manifestation of God's love the individual people that God allows to come across our paths.",

When Jesus\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 strength was failing under the Cross, they looked for a person to carry the cross and they got Simon to carry the Cross. He was, according to some Bible commentators, the father of Alexander and Rufus who became members of the New Testament church. He didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want to but he was forced to. He was born in North Africa. Through his carrying the Cross there was blessing upon his children. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a pity when Africans say that Jesus is for the white people.

His father Zacharias and mother Elizabeth were well advanced in age, well past child bearing age. But then God revealed Himself to Zacharias that they would bear a son and call him John, meaning the \"grace of God\". The birth of John was prophesied many years before. Isaiah who lived about 740 BC prophesied of his birth and so too Malachi, about 540 BC. One could have a whole sermon on Isaiah\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s prophesy and another of Malachi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s.

When the pursuit of the people of God does not differ from the pursuits of a perishing society around us God will withdraw His presence from us. When we are motivated by the desire to be glorified of men, and our focus is on titles, positions and prominence, we will create a man-made glory. Jesus speaks to these ministries and calls them an abomination and says that they will fall under a curse. There is a day coming when the true church of Jesus Christ will stand up against these false prophets. God will rise up and deliver His people. God will reveal Himself to those who are grieved at what is being done to the name of Jesus and grieved at the way society is living without God. These Christians are not spiritual giants, they simply love Jesus and have a passionate desire for Him to be glorified in these last days.",

It\u2019s for: dishonest people who want to trust God but don\u2019t know how, selfish people that want to be generous, wounded hearts that want to let go and forgive, and the verbally abusive who have a desire to speak with kind words. How do we get free from this? How do we experience peace on earth and goodwill towards man? The answer is the gift of Jesus. God in the flesh burst forth into the visible because humanity had no way out! This is the message of Christmas. He came with a display of compassion for our weaknesses and nailed them to a Tree. The good news is that Jesus forgives our sin and enables us to live a life that is pleasing to Him and those around us.",

I believe our nation, and particularly the church is at this cross road now. God has sent alarming signs to us to show us the path we are on and what is coming. And unless a proper response is done by the church, we will go down in the history books as, 'having eyes to see, but could not see; having ears to hear, but could not hear'.
