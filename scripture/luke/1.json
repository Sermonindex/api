With gentleness, he reminds all believers how easily we can fall into unbelief regardless of how close we walk with Him.",

I came to Christ at a Billy Graham Los Angeles Crusade in the 1960's. While completing my Bachelor of Science degree in Business Administration at Cal Poly Pomona, I sensed the call of God on my life to follow Jesus Christ completely and possibly forget business and prepare for the ministry.. Soon after that I met Alan Redpath who invited me and my wife Jean to England, where we attended Capernwray Bible School. Upon returning to the United States, I continued my studies at Talbot Seminary in La Mirada, California.\r\nEarly in my ministry, I served for four years as an assistant pastor to Chuck Smith at Calvary Chapel of Costa Mesa, California. Next Jean and I moved to Lake Arrowhead where we planted and pastored Calvary Chapel of Lake Arrowhead. During those years I founded Calvary Chapel Bible College in nearby Twin Peaks at the Calvary Chapel Conference Center (The college is now located in Murrieta Hot Springs). Sensing the Lord's direction to move on, we then pioneered and pastored another Calvary Chapel in Redlands, California, for eleven years. In 1991, we again, still having that pioneering heart, moved to San Jose with the heart to plant a number of churches in the Bay Area. There are now eight fellowships that have grown out of Calvary Chapel of San Jose. In September 2002, we responded to a request from Chuck Smith to return to Calvary Chapel of Costa Mesa to serve as an assistant. And, in 2004 we took to the leadership of Calvary Chapel of Laguna Beach to help guide it through a difficult time. That work being completed, we have now responded to a long time desire to step out and serve the churches and schools and missionaries that we love so much around the world. Which brings us now to Calvary Way Ministries.",

This was a great experience for Mary and she wanted to share it with her friend, Elizabeth. Elizabeth was upright and served the Lord faithfully. Although Elizabeth was much older than Mary they could share deep spiritual things with one another. In spiritual matters, age does not matter; only one's spiritual state is important. It is a blessing when one's friend walks with God. Then people are united because of the things of God and can bear one another's burdens. However, be careful not to unite with others in evil, like Ananias and Sapphira (Acts 5). Although Mary was only a teenager, she delighted herself in the things of God. She was full of joy because God has finally sent the promised Messiah Who would bruise the serpent's head and bring forgiveness and true liberty. She hid God's words in her heart. The world and the things of the world lost its value, because heaven filled her heart.",

            "description": "This matter of the birth of John the Baptist is amazing. Jesus said of him that there were none born of women greater than he. He was filled with the Holy Spirit from his mother\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s womb. Even his birth was miraculous. His father Zacharias and mother Elizabeth were well advanced in age, well past child bearing age. But then God revealed Himself to Zacharias that they would bear a son and call him John, meaning the \"grace of God\". The birth of John was prophesied many years before. Isaiah who lived about 740 BC prophesied of his birth and so too Malachi, about 540 BC. One could have a whole sermon on Isaiah\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s prophesy and another of Malachi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s. They prophesied how that John would be the forerunner of the Messiah.",
