Zacharias the priest was the first to hear the Word of the Lord, yet despite his righteousness, he chose to be in unbelief. Ed Miller begins his study in Chapter 1 with contrasting Zacharias' unbelief with Mary's faith. With gentleness, he reminds all believers how easily we can fall into unbelief regardless of how close we walk with Him.",

She responds to the angel's pronouncement with child-like faith, with complete and total surrender and is a picture of humility. She is trusting that God the Father will form Christ in her. In the same way, His Church is to surrender and believe that He, by the power of the Holy Spirit, will produce the same miracle of forming the Christian life in us.",

This was a great experience for Mary and she wanted to share it with her friend, Elizabeth. Elizabeth was upright and served the Lord faithfully. Although Elizabeth was much older than Mary they could share deep spiritual things with one another. In spiritual matters, age does not matter; only one's spiritual state is important. It is a blessing when one's friend walks with God. Then people are united because of the things of God and can bear one another's burdens. However, be careful not to unite with others in evil, like Ananias and Sapphira (Acts 5). Although Mary was only a teenager, she delighted herself in the things of God. She was full of joy because God has finally sent the promised Messiah Who would bruise the serpent's head and bring forgiveness and true liberty. She hid God's words in her heart. The world and the things of the world lost its value, because heaven filled her heart.",

He was filled with the Holy Spirit from his mother\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s womb. Even his birth was miraculous. His father Zacharias and mother Elizabeth were well advanced in age, well past child bearing age. But then God revealed Himself to Zacharias that they would bear a son and call him John, meaning the \"grace of God\". The birth of John was prophesied many years before. Isaiah who lived about 740 BC prophesied of his birth and so too Malachi, about 540 BC. One could have a whole sermon on Isaiah\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s prophesy and another of Malachi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s. They prophesied how that John would be the forerunner of the Messiah.",
