The point of the parable of the Good Samaritan is not, \"Help your neighbor,\" but one of character: who are you?  Mary becomes the example of the gospel by sitting at Jesus' feet as a receiver.  To Martha, Jesus was the honored guest; to Mary, He was the host.",

No man can be spiritually healthy who does not meditate and commune; no man, on the other hand, is as he should be unless he is active and diligent in holy service. David sweetly sang, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153He maketh me to lie down in green pastures;\u00e2\u20ac\u009d there was the contemplative, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153he leadeth me beside the still waters;\u00e2\u20ac\u009d there was the active and progressive: the difficulty is to maintain the two, and to keep each in its relative proportion to the other.
