In prayer we pour out our hearts before the Lord, expressing our longings to see Him and to depend upon Him for everything.",

We couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t even wake them up with our trumpets.  We had to go out into the field where the shepherds were watching.  They were awake.  They were awake\u00e2\u20ac\u201dthey heard us.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d I heard an Alliance preacher say that angels don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t sing.  I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know.

An evil spirit doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t find rest in the wilderness and then he decides to go back to the one he has left and see how it goes. Then he finds the house put in order and neat and he goes and finds seven others which he met in the wilderness, worse than himself, and they go and inhabit that person. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a dangerous thing to say you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve made a decision for Christ but you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t go all the way but only do it half-heartedly. The devil doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t like it in the wilderness. He wants to stay in a nice place, even in those made in God\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s image.",

            "description": "There is a real spiritual battle when a Christian tries to pray. Even the disciples asked Jesus to teach them how to pray. As they listened to the Lord pray to his Father, something stirred them about how Jesus prayed, the intimacy Jesus had with the Father  was apparent to them as they listened to his prayer, prompting them to ask him to teach them to pray. Praying the scriptures adds power to prayer. This is a wonderful instruction on how to pray, for anyone who's become discouraged with their prayer life, this is a must hear.",

It will be revealed in eternity of how many times God warned us, gave us wake up calls, for what was coming, but we missed the warning signals. I believe our nation, and particularly the church is at this cross road now. God has sent alarming signs to us to show us the path we are on and what is coming. And unless a proper response is done by the church, we will go down in the history books as, 'having eyes to see, but could not see; having ears to hear, but could not hear'. Brethren I beseech you take notice of these words and let us respond now, while there is still time, before the 'night cometh when no man can work'.",
