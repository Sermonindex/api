Billy Graham once said that in the beginning people came with tears because of their sins, but lately they come with smiles. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no true repentance. An evil spirit doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t find rest in the wilderness and then he decides to go back to the one he has left and see how it goes. Then he finds the house put in order and neat and he goes and finds seven others which he met in the wilderness, worse than himself, and they go and inhabit that person. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a dangerous thing to say you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve made a decision for Christ but you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t go all the way but only do it half-heartedly. The devil doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t like it in the wilderness. He wants to stay in a nice place, even in those made in God\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s image.",

And unless a proper response is done by the church, we will go down in the history books as, 'having eyes to see, but could not see; having ears to hear, but could not hear'.
