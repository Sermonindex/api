            "description": "Brother Zac looks at the very dangerous imbalance of holiness preaching taken to a extreme. This message serves as a gentle warning in love to many who have strong convictions that go past what God calls and leads. We need zealous strong individuals that display the compassion of God but a unyielding desire for truth. The true body of Christ should fulfill the same function as Jesus did while on earth--exposing unreality and religious hypocrisy.  As Zac has studied many groups in Christendom that majored on holiness, all of their mistakes could be summed up in one thing: pharisaism.  Many precious principles are put forth that we may ask the question: \"Am I really presenting Christ correctly?\"",

David Servant has been serving in ministry since 1979 as a church-planter, pastor, teacher and missionary. When David Servant read the results of his high-school vocational aptitude test, he laughed. The results told him that he was best suited for a career in ministry or in entertainment. At the time, David's future goal was to live in a log cabin in the wilderness and live off the land for the rest of his life. The Lord, however, had different plans for David Servant. God didn't intend for him to run away from the world, but rather to play a part in changing the world by building God's kingdom. David received his call to ministry during his (reluctant) freshman year at Penn State, and one year later was enrolled in Bible School.\r\n\r\nDavid Servant is the author of eight books, including Forever Rich, and the The Disciple-Making Minister, a 500-page equipping manual that has been translated into more than 20 languages and is being distributed to tens of thousands of pastors.",
