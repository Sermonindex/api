The invitation to God's banquet is to the humble (not the proud) and reveals the generous heart of the Lord.  The parable of counting the cost and the king going to battle contrasts once again the religion of the Pharisees of bills and fights with exclusive devotion to Jesus to supply all the resources we need to build and every victory in the fight.",

There are many different ingredients that make up the recipe of the gospel.  This series attempts to show all the ingredients of the gospel.  This is important because if our recipe is different than Gods, then we will not get the same result found in the book of Acts.",

I FEEL in such a haste to go out and obey this commandment this morning, by compelling those to come in who are now tarrying in the highways and hedges, that I cannot wait for an introduction, but must at once set about my business. Hear then, O ye that are strangers to the truth as it is in Jesus \u00e2\u20ac\u201d hear then the message that I have to bring you. Ye have fallen, fallen in your father Adam; ye have fallen also in yourselves, by your daily sin and your constant iniquity; you have provoked the anger of the Most High; and as assuredly as you have sinned, so certainly must God punish you if you persevere in your iniquity, for the Lord is a God of justice, and will by no means spare the guilty. But have you not heard, hath it not long been spoken in your ears, that God, in his infinite mercy, has devised a way whereby, without any infringement upon his honor, he can have mercy upon you, the guilty and the undeserving? To you I speak; and my voice is unto you, O sons of men; Jesus Christ, very God of very God, hath descended from heaven, and was made in the likeness of sinful flesh. Begotten of the Holy Ghost, he was born of the Virgin Mary; he lived in this world a life of exemplary holiness, and of the deepest suffering, till at last he gave himself up to die for our sins, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153the just for the unjust, to bring us to God.'...",

He does not begin to build a house which he will not be able to finish, nor commence a war which he cannot hope to fight through. The religion of Christ is the most reasonable one in the world, and Jesus Christ never desires to have any disciples who shall blindly follow him without counting the cost. We always esteem it to be a happy thing when we can get men to sit down and consider. The most of you are so full of other thoughts, so occupied with the world, ever running hither and thither about your ordinary business, that we cannot get you to think, or calmly sit down, and soberly look at things as in the light of eternity, and weigh them deliberately as you ought. And yet it is only reasonable that the Master should ask of you to do for him with regard to your own spiritual matters, what you will admit that every sensible man does in his business continually. You are poor traders if you never have any stock-takings: you are likely to be ere long in the bankruptcy court if there is no periodical examination...",

Tozer poses a solemn question: \u201cCan it be so that a man can be orthodox, sound in his creed\u2026 loyal to the church of his fathers, and still be blind, cruel, and bigoted\u2014and wicked?\u201d Is a common sinner the real enemy, or is it the self-righteous religionist, who cares not at all for the lost? In Luke 14:1-6, Jesus saved a man who the religious leaders would not and could not heal. \u201cBrothers and sisters, shall it be religion or shall it be Christ?\u201d",

This message is preached in the concluding session at a conference. This forceful message over and over again poses the question: \"will you follow me?\" and then asks have we given Him our all? This sermon demands that you count the cost of true discipleship with Jesus Christ. Are we willing to agree to the demands of discipleship: \"No refusual, no rival, no retreat, I am ready Lord, cost what it will!\"",

This is a life-changing series that will challenge you to the core of your being. We need to re-examine our commitment to the Lord Jesus Christ in our day, may God have full-hearted disciples that have counted the cost fully and give all to the great calling of discipleship.",
