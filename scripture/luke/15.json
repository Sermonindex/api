Two ways the Father seeks is He allows the son to go and waste his inheritance and sends a famine \"to lower the bottom.\"  The great love of God is pictured here in the only place in the whole Bible where we see Him running.",

Their cry to go and make new disciples is backed up with their very lives. In many cases if they speak to the wrong person about Jesus, they face prison, torture and even death. The task of sharing the Gospel is for every Christian, even if they give their life as a martyr. Chinese Christians teach us that when their seed (their life) has gone into the ground and died it will multiply and produce much more fruit.544 With their blood new growth is coming. The seed, their body that died now produces 100 fold, 1000 fold or even more.",

Because God sees us for who we are in Jesus and not who we are as sinners, we are empowered to become a community that doesn't bear grudges, belittle those who have hurt us, or force people to carry the sins of their past with them forever.",

Jesus spent time with the tax collectors and sinners, and was criticized severely by the scribes and pharisees. What type of people were the tax collector? The tax collectors in Jesus\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 day collected the tax for the government of the day, the Roman government. Nobody liked them. When they taxed people, they would add to the cost for their own pocket. They were thieves, charging more than the government required. And even today there are such people in the world who require bribes for their work. These tax collectors were therefore despised. And Jesus was sitting with them and ate with them! We must be careful interpreting this lest we think that Jesus loves a person that is corrupt and steals from others. And the sinners with whom Jesus ate would include those who divorce, adulterers, drunkards, blasphemers of God, very evil people.",
