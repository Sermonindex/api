            "description": "There is contrast in this life between the splendor of the rich man and the poverty of Lazarus; there is also the contrast of complete reversal of condition for each man when he dies; God's tender care in the ministry of angels at death; Lazarus was brought into intimate relationship to the saints in heaven; the rich man's torments in hell were so extreme that he desired even a momentary alleviation; the condition of each man after death cannot be changed; the rich man's request that a messenger from the dead be sent to warn his brothers insinuates that God had been unjust in not giving more opportunity for repentance; but messengers from the dead would not bring us to repentance if we will not hearken to the warnings of Scripture.",

Have you experienced the \"expulsive power of a new affection\"?  Brother Zac shares ways to kindle a true hunger for Christ by meditating on how much He suffered for you on the cross, getting into fellowship with those who have a fervent love for Jesus, giving up whatever takes away your hunger for God, and others.",

Even in hell, he tried to reach out to others so they wouldn\u2019t share his unspeakable fate. Dr. Tozer uses the story of Lazarus and the Rich Man to illustrate the Truth that a person\u2019s final destination does not depend on whether he is rich or poor. He says they\u2019re in Heaven or hell simply because that is where they belong.",
