The important thing about faith is the Object of your faith; faith lays hold of God who does impossible things!  Ed shows from the healing of the ten lepers that the one who returned emphasizes the heart obedience that blesses Christ as contrasted with the nine who only followed the letter of the command.",

There is a warning in this message related to the modern church, in that we have access to all that we need today to live in God's will, just as did Lot, his wife, and daughters, who willfully turned away, though they were closely related to Abraham. Brother Len quotes Romans 1 from Phillip's translation. Classic Ravenhill: \"I'm angry with Lot. Wait 'til I see him. I'll tell him off, I'll tell you that.\"",

            "description": "Have we ever thanked God from the bottom of our hearts? Someone once said, \u201cThe way to receive, is to give thanks.\u201d And these words are especially true when it comes to experiencing the reality of God. This meditation can help our hearts to become thankful again. And thankful people are happy and rich.

            "description": "January 21, 2007 - There is a season coming when everything that is not Christ's will be washed away. Society will not be aware of these times. These are days when the gospel that speaks of the Cross and living righteously for God will be ignored. There will be many who have walked with Jesus and they will fall away from truth. In this generation there has to be a cry in our hearts that says, \"Jesus give me the courage not to go back to what I left behind.\" There is an anointing that will be released in those that have this cry and God will be glorified in and through their lives.",
