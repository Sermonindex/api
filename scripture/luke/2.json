This applies to young people and to parents who must bring up their children properly. The Bible says \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Teach your children in His way and then they will not deviate from it.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d You parents and mothers, do you hear? Parents complain and say the children don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want to listen but the problem is with the parents. You can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t blame poverty for it. It's usually those that are better off that go wrong. In the world you hear it is poverty that causes the problems. That is not true.

It will be given to the humble person who desires to live their life for the betterment of others. God will come in the midst of darkness and reveal Himself to the shepherds who are simply looking after their flock. Suddenly the heavens will be opened and by the grace of God we will begin to reach out to those who are hungry and hurting. Suddenly our ears will be opened to the worship of Heaven and we will sing a song of trust and confidence in God. A song that says, \"Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace and good will towards men.\" Our song is a living expression of trust in God.",

            "description": "The Christmas event shook everyone on earth, in heaven and even in hell. When Adam and Eve sinned they were expelled from the garden and cherubims with flaming swords were placed to prevent them from entering again. Now in our text, it says the angels came to the shepherds. So though the angels stopped anybody from entering into paradise, now it was the angels who brought the glad tidings that anyone can enter into glory through the birth of the Saviour. Do you see the awesome wonder of Christmas! God opening this gate that was closed. Though we give each other gifts at Christmas they fade into insignificance in comparison to that which we received from God at Christmas.",

            "description": "December 20, 2009 - This message is for those who know the right thing to do but find that you are powerless to do so. It\u2019s for: dishonest people who want to trust God but don\u2019t know how, selfish people that want to be generous, wounded hearts that want to let go and forgive, and the verbally abusive who have a desire to speak with kind words. How do we get free from this? How do we experience peace on earth and goodwill towards man? The answer is the gift of Jesus. God in the flesh burst forth into the visible because humanity had no way out! This is the message of Christmas. He came with a display of compassion for our weaknesses and nailed them to a Tree. The good news is that Jesus forgives our sin and enables us to live a life that is pleasing to Him and those around us.",
