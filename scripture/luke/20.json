Bigger than the question of authority is the principle of revelation.  Christ will always be silent to those who do not seriously want to know the truth.  In the parable of the wicked vinedressers, though it pictures the judgment upon unfaithful Israel, more than that it pictures the amazing longsuffering of God.",
