Something in us does not want to accept the idea that in the end times all nations will hate and persecute Christians. This seems like a non-reality to us and something that could never happen because we live in such religiously tolerant countries such as Canada, United Kingdom and United States. We would like to edit our Lord\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Words and abbreviate them with a softer less harsh reality. Yet, this will not change the truth our Lord said would happen.",
