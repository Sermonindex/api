At that time many will turn away from the faith and will betray and hate each other.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d845\r\nOur Lord spoke these sobering words to us, as found in the Gospel of Matthew chapter 24. Something in us does not want to accept the idea that in the end times all nations will hate and persecute Christians. This seems like a non-reality to us and something that could never happen because we live in such religiously tolerant countries such as Canada, United Kingdom and United States. We would like to edit our Lord\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Words and abbreviate them with a softer less harsh reality. Yet, this will not change the truth our Lord said would happen.",

They were in dire straits and the famine in Jerusalem was so severe that some even ate their children. The Romans slaughtered the Jews so that it's a miracle that any Jew survived that generation. About the sun and moon turning dark. When Jesus hang on the cross there was total darkness from noon till 3pm, for three hours. Daniel said in the end times knowledge will increase, and we know how knowledge increased in our time.",
