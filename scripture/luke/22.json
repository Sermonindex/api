The Iranians believe that Jesus Christ is with them in their small gatherings and therefore there is a confidence that they are meeting as a Church even if there are just a few believers present. They count it a necessity to network with others and consider themselves all part of one Church. There is no choice to try to find a different church for doctrinal preference or worship style; all believers are content to meet simply with each other.",

In the coming days many will experience intense sorrow as our image of God and our own image of how we think Christ should be glorified through us will suddenly be taken away from us. Things that we thought we were going to be in Christ and things that we thought God was obligated to do through us will suddenly be shaken. God in His mercy will shake everything that can be shaken so we can gain a right perspective of who He is and who we are in Christ! God will shake it all until all worldly security is gone and there is nothing left in His church but Christ Himself!",

From the garden on through the resurrection circumstances revealed.  No more were they boasting of their capacity to be the greatest.  During the dark night of the crisis of the Christ, all was revealed.  It is in this that the Apostle Paul gloried, nothing other than the cross of Christ, for nothing else has the capacity to reveal what we are.   The sufferings of Christ, viewed with sincerity, will always beget personal revelation.  We must be apprehended by the cross.  If this is not the case, then we will be absolutely unable to serve God in any form of spiritual community.  Just like it was a suffering for Christ to display the truth of who he was, so also, our apprehension of the truth of what we are will be suffering.",

The Bible says that Jesus took upon Himself the form of a servant and in doing this He teaches us that heavens order is completely reversed from the world's order. The Word of God is performed in those whom have a servant's heart. Serving Christ and then serving others unlocks power and revelation. You may feel trampled, pounded, unappreciated and passed by but as a servant you have found the secret of spiritual strength! Take heed; the last will be first and the first will be last!",
