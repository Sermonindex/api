The wilderness is not a place to be avoided, but rather a place to be understood. There is something of God in this place. God Himself will allure us there to speak comfort and strengthen us. He will take away all things that we believe He has given us, when in reality He never did. In this place God will deal with all that has captivated our heart and would hinder His life from being lived through us. In the wilderness the natural becomes supernatural and we are brought back to a right perspective. When we get through this deep dealing of God we are enabled to make the choice to be poured out for Jesus so that others can be grafted into His power and lineage. The lesson learned from this experience is that the power of God is found in those who will be given for others!",

            "description": "Throughout this beautiful and anointed message, Jackie shares many wonderful testimonies of the work of the Holy Spirit saving, healing and delivering drug addicts, prostitutes and criminals in the Wall City in Hong Kong. She speaks about the revival in China, and how teenage girls leave their homes and walk from village to village sharing Jesus. They come back two years later and multitudes have accepted Christ. These girls have never been to a seminar or a worship service. They simply give everything they have away. Jackie also witnesses about brothers and sisters coming out of decades in prison with broken bodies many times, but rejoicing and shining in their Saviour. She emphasizes that the revival in China is not facilitated by visual aids, life changing tapes, videos of the month or Christian magazines. It comes through the Holy Spirit using \"just a few people who aren't very educated, without microphones, who loved their lives not unto death - that's it.\" In this way, God has chosen the foolish things of the world to shame the wise (1 Corinthians 1:26-27). Jesus came to preach the good news to the poor (Luke 4:18). Jackie explains how the poor are often able to hear the gospel much quicker than an educated person, because they can hear spiritually. This is why the poor in spirit are blessed (Matthew 5:3). Jackie Pullinger emphasizes that men and women are saved through the Spirit of God, not through man's reasoning. She concludes with a call to die and a profound challenge: \"His glory will fall if you go out with nothing except a broken heart and some precious seed, and I suppose we have all got that.\"",

This is the reason why there is such a powerless testimony and the church is becoming a non issue in this society. We cannot be devoted to the Lord and be devoted to the things that offend His holy name. God is calling His church to come outside the camp and come out of mixture and compromise to serve the Lord wholeheartedly.

            "description": "December 17, 2006 - The devil was corrupted by his distorted image of himself and in this corruption he desired to be worshipped. The very heart of satan finds refuge in religion and causes false teachers and false prophets to be moved outside of the true works of God. These types of preachers make their way into pulpits and bow down to the worship and agenda of man. When worship is true worship the voice of God is immediately heard. Wisdom is found of God as we lay down our treasures at His feet with no agenda of personal gain. True worship is content in seeking the likeness of Christ and is surrendered totally to His purposes.",

            "description": "The most tragic of all things is to be unaware that the Glory Of God is passing us by. When the pursuit of the people of God does not differ from the pursuits of a perishing society around us God will withdraw His presence from us. When we are motivated by the desire to be glorified of men, and our focus is on titles, positions and prominence, we will create a man-made glory. Jesus speaks to these ministries and calls them an abomination and says that they will fall under a curse. There is a day coming when the true church of Jesus Christ will stand up against these false prophets. God will rise up and deliver His people. God will reveal Himself to those who are grieved at what is being done to the name of Jesus and grieved at the way society is living without God. These Christians are not spiritual giants, they simply love Jesus and have a passionate desire for Him to be glorified in these last days.",
