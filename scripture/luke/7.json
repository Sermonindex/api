Though Jesus never visited John in prison, He had a high regard for him, and we can expect in our trials at times not to hear, \"Well done, good and faithful servant,\" down here.  There is a difference between doubting (struggling faith) and disbelieving, and the good news is that God accepts struggling faith as faith.",
