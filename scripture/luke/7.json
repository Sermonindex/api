Though Jesus never visited John in prison, He had a high regard for him, and we can expect in our trials at times not to hear, \"Well done, good and faithful servant,\" down here.  There is a difference between doubting (struggling faith) and disbelieving, and the good news is that God accepts struggling faith as faith.",

Prayer is preoccupation with our needs. Praise is preoccupation with our blessings. Worship is preoccupation with God Himself.  Many Christians substitute service for worship, remembering the first commandment is to worship the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your mine and all your strength, and to worship Him in spirit and truth and the beauty of holiness; for the Father seeks those who will truly worship Him.",

We may sit under the preaching with a pretense of wanting to be taught, but in reality we will not be moved from our view. We are living in a generation where some of the body of believers are using the name of Jesus for their own objectives. When we have a proper perspective of Christ we will reverence His presence, and stand in awe of the fact that He comes into our homes and into our heart. We will take out a basin and wash the feet of Jesus with worship, prayer and gratitude. We will embrace His word trusting it to be a higher reality than every situation we are facing.",

He doesn't want this dirt on his hands because it offends his religion. The fruit of this religion that does not have the heart of God in it is a cold formality and a skepticism. When was the last time you raised up your hands to God and thanked Him for what He has done in your life and His faithfulness? Tears of gratitude refresh Jesus. These tears come from a genuine work of God and a worship that remembers where He brought us from and that He is the source of my work.",
