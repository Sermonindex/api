When the man  is found by the neighboring citizens, clothed and sitting at the feet of Jesus in his right mind, instead of rejoicing at his deliverance, they reject Jesus, and ask him to leave for they are unwilling to follow him if it means losing their pigs. Many are unwilling to trust their life to Jesus, and are holding back part of themselves, unwilling to surrender, having counted the cost and the price too high. If you are happy with average, this message isn't for you. If you are determined to follow Jesus, wholly,  listen with an open heart.",

            "description": "Nobody would believe a boat would go down with Jesus on it, would they? He stilled the water and calmed the storm for the disciples. But when Paul, and the prisoners were on the boat, bound for Rome, the storm tore the boat to pieces, and it went down. Paul had a word of hope from the Lord. All hell watched as God exposed every tool of the enemy, by sending them against Paul in this circumstance and his servant overcome. He kept him, and strengthened him. A wonderful message of encouragement for anyone in a hard trial. God prepares his people before the storm hits. And he takes them through it.",
