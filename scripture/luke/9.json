            "description": "What does it mean to take up your cross daily? There is an element of denial and sacrifice to take up your cross. But here Jesus speaks of denying oneself and taking up the cross, as if it were two different things. In fact, taking up your cross involves all tree of the points above. What does God say to you personally when He commands you to take up your cross daily? You cannot say that Christ has done everything and you needn't do anything anymore. Here is something for you to do. In Roman times it was a very difficult task to carry a heavy, rugged, wooden cross. Jesus doesn't say that He will take and carry your cross for you, but commands you to take up your cross daily and follow Him. Many people have their idea of what the Christian life is like, but it's as far away as the east is from the west from what Jesus commanded.",
