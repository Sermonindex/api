Brother Ed points out some unique characteristics of this prophet and how his message is one of such a nature to cause us to cry, \"Dig deep, O God, and know my heart.\"  (This series of messages was given in the spring of 2003 to a men's retreat in Easton, Maryland.)",

God is calling us to return to Him, deny self and bring provision to the poor and needy, the downtrodden and those that are struggling. It's in returning to God, that we will begin to be an extension of His hand for provision and life to the poor.
