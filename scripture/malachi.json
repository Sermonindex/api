            "description": "A marvelous testimony of God's power through a woman who had committed her life to her Saviour. From the 1930's to 1940's, the Lord led her to face WWII and communism in Northern China, where she saved over a 100 orphans. After China fell to the communists, the Lord led her to the islands of Hong Kong and Taiwan, where the love He put in her heart for the Chinese and lost children continued until her death in 1970. Through her stories, she encourages all believers to completely give their entire beings to God and see what He can do with such a life entrusted to Him.",

Half hearted sacrifice will always produce a spiritual dullness. If we bring God a blind sacrifice we will be blinded. Before the Lord comes back He will send a word to us that will turn the people's focus from a self focus to a focus that is fixed on Jesus Christ. God will raise up a voice in this generation to clean things up. God is calling His church to bring the totality of our lives to Him for the betterment of humanity. Will you give all for the sake of this generation?",

Discernment is also the ability to understand who is serving God and who is not serving God. God is calling us to return to Him, deny self and bring provision to the poor and needy, the downtrodden and those that are struggling. It's in returning to God, that we will begin to be an extension of His hand for provision and life to the poor. Are you giving \"YOUR ALL\" for the purposes of God and the furtherance of His Kingdom.",

The closer we get to the presence of Christ the more undone we feel and we are made aware of the grace and mercy that continually covers us. This visitation comes to gives us a heart for the poor and when the Spirit of God is flowing through us spiritual poverty is broken.
