The primary motivation for both our sending of missionaries, and also our going as missionaries is two-fold, we must not send men, but the truth of God, and we do not go primarily for man, but for God. The promotion of His name for His glory is the driving force behind the true missions of the Church.",

God promises to those that seek Him with all their hearts that He will lead them into all truth. Truth seekers are those that worship God acceptably, but we must be careful of falling into the error of by our own human minds diserning and doubting all that is of God.",
