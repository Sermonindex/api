Discernment is also the ability to understand who is serving God and who is not serving God. God is calling us to return to Him, deny self and bring provision to the poor and needy, the downtrodden and those that are struggling. It's in returning to God, that we will begin to be an extension of His hand for provision and life to the poor.
