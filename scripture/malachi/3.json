Before the Lord comes back He will send a word to us that will turn the people's focus from a self focus to a focus that is fixed on Jesus Christ. God will raise up a voice in this generation to clean things up. God is calling His church to bring the totality of our lives to Him for the betterment of humanity.

Discernment is also the ability to understand who is serving God and who is not serving God. God is calling us to return to Him, deny self and bring provision to the poor and needy, the downtrodden and those that are struggling. It's in returning to God, that we will begin to be an extension of His hand for provision and life to the poor.

            "description": "February 15, 2009 - What is it like when the Lord visits His People? This sudden appearing will come as a strong inner voice of conviction. When the Holy Spirit comes we become aware of the ungodliness of our speech. The closer we get to the presence of Christ the more undone we feel and we are made aware of the grace and mercy that continually covers us. This visitation comes to gives us a heart for the poor and when the Spirit of God is flowing through us spiritual poverty is broken. Christ inside of us will heal us and give us fresh vision of the future.",

But for the Christian that really wants the heart of God and desires the fullness of Christ, you will go into the refiners fire. Each one will go through our own fire according to the impurities that is in us. God will allow this fire for the last days so He can raise up a tried and tested army.",

            "description": "This world is being flooded with sin and abomination by a devil intent on destroying and carrying away everyone he can, especially those who have a love for Jesus Christ in their heart and have his Spirit inside them. These are they who are crying out to God, who still hunger and thirst after righteousness, inspite of the apostasy in the mainstream church, and a sin-sick world, there are those who still hunger for God. This is a sobering message reflective of today's society, but ends in a joyous certainty of the victory and provision of our Lord for his people.",
