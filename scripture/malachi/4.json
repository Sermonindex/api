The heaviest load falls upon the fathers to represent God to the children, and without that flow of the turned heart in love, time, discipline and teaching, the inevitable result is the curse of disobedience which plagues so much of American society today.",

Zacharias the priest was the first to hear the Word of the Lord, yet despite his righteousness, he chose to be in unbelief. Ed Miller begins his study in Chapter 1 with contrasting Zacharias' unbelief with Mary's faith. With gentleness, he reminds all believers how easily we can fall into unbelief regardless of how close we walk with Him.",
