At the same time the Church in North Korea recognizes whom God has specifically gifted as shepherds. Such servant leaders are esteemed but not idolized.",

He has been building a pure pristine Book of Acts fellowship in House Church networks all over rural China. There is a simplicity to the move of God yet such fervency, love, and desire born in the hearts of these believers. We need to break out of the simple 1 hour church meeting patterns, and start to serve the Lord with full commitment like many of these precious brothers and sisters in the Lord. For many of us the questions and truths that are revealed are very important for us to hear as we gather under the Headship of Jesus Christ in local areas.",

The presence of God was bought with the Blood of Jesus as He endured the violence of the cross through a passionate love for humanity. May we never become familiar and careless with the His presence that was purchased for a with a passionate love of a father that sent His only Son to Die on a cross so that we can be free.",

The word offended means to be moved to leaning on your reasoning rather than trusting the plan that God has for your life. When difficulties and trails come you will be tempted to take another course and follow another Jesus. The key to avoid this is to have a deep abiding trust in the faithfulness of God, knowing that His ways are not our ways and He has a divine plan. Take comfort in knowing we are in hands that are much bigger than ours and we will be triumphed over. Jesus Christ promises us we will make it to the other side.",

Hard times are coming before the Lord comes for his people, and those who do not pray won't be ready or able to face it. People are too busy to pray, they praise the Lord but don't pray to him. He is a stranger among them in his own house. Convicting!!!!",

Thus our forgiveness came at the greatest cost to Him the death of His Son, the Lord Jesus.  And it is not without a cost that we are to forgive others as we have been forgiven, to forgive means to forgoe our rights and to suffer the cost.  Pastor Hession shows that at the root of unforgiveness is pride saying 'I wont forgive this person, they have violated my rights!' and also that when we are wronged and forgive then when the person comes and ask forgiveness we will be able to say 'There is nothing to forgive' as it is an old account that has been settled, just as ours was on Calvary.",

Mr Moses Khoza also gave His testimony of how he had strayed from God, but God has shown him grace, granted him forgiveness of sin and even touched him physically. Before he came to KwaSizabantu he was in hospital and had a terrible experience. The people in his ward were very sick. One night he went to fetch himself some water to drink. When he came back to his bed, one of the patients begged him for some water. When he had fetched the water, the man didn't want to drink it, but asked mr Khoza to pour it onto his neck and chest, for he felt like he was burning. After that the next patient had the same request and then the next. It carried on for quite a while. The next morning two of the patients had passed away. God spoke to him through the incident, and he came to KwaSizabantu and met with the Lord afresh.",

They found common ground in their enmity against Jesus. On the way to be crucified, history teaches us that Jesus was carrying His cross and fell down because He was weak from all the torture. The Bible doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t specifically say that but historians mention it. But the Bible does tell us that when He went to Gethsemane, He took with Him His disciples only to a certain point and three others a little further and left them too and He went still a little further and prayed earnestly, even so that His sweat drops were as blood. He was in a terrific battle, and He prayed and said, \"Father if it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s possible let this cup pass from Me, nevertheless not My will but Your will be done\". That cup was filled with your sin and my sin - the sin of the world. He Who is the Holy Son of God became sin for us! Jesus was fully man and fully God.",

I believe it to be preached in the 60's and the recording was taken from a Record LP so there will be some background noise of the record due to quality. In this message wilkerson addresses the deplorable situation in American homes and gives an urgent call for people to wake up and start to really live as a family should live. This message is counter-cultural and against the spirit of the age of progress and technology, simplier times are and were better. I am sure many families will take much of the simple application into everyday life.",

His character made him the true king, and the nominal king trembled before him. A man is not to be estimated according to his rank, but according to his character. The peerage which God recognises is arranged according to a man's justice and holiness. He is first before God and holy angels who is first in obedience; and he reigns and is made a king and a priest whom God hath sanctified and clothed with the fair white linen of a holy life. Be not covetous of worldly honors, for you will have honor enough even from wicked men if your lives are \u201choliness unto the Lord.\u201d Let it be written on John's tomb, if he needs an epitaph, \u201cHerod feared John.\u201d Only there is one better testimonial which any minister of the gospel might be glad to receive, and it is this: \u201cJohn did no miracle, but all things which he spake concerning this man were true.\u201d",

The Saints Sensitive Heart (they all said \"is it I?\") 2. The Social Gospel (all the teaching and example of Christ is not enough to save the soul and sin is not in the fact that Judas did not follow protocol but that his heart was not right) 3.

A tradition dating from the 2nd century ascribes this book to John Mark, a companion of Peter and also of Paul and Barnabas in their missionary endeavors. The preaching of Peter may well have been the source of most of Mark\u2019s material. Mark accounts for the ministry of Jesus from His Baptism to His Ascension. Most commentaries agree that Mark\u2019s purpose was neither biographical nor historical, but theological: to present Jesus as the Christ, the mighty worker rather than great teacher. Hence, Mark makes fewer references to the Parables and discourses, but meticulously records each of Jesus\u2019 \"mighty works\" as evidence of His divine power. Mark contains 20 specific miracles and alludes to others. Bible scholars quite generally agree that Mark wrote his Gospel in Rome for the gentiles.",

            "description": "November 4, 2007 - Jesus offers us not just a future hope but a present reality. Some of us have a present trust while we seek a future hope. God calls us to give up our present trust and walk with Him. What are you trusting in that keeps you locked out of the power of God's Kingdom? God's Kingdom is a NOW Kingdom and He beckons us to leave behind what we once trusted in, let go of all our baggage, and slip through the eye of the needle! It's the person who realizes he has nothing to offer God but a willing heart that slips through the Eye of the Needle. The issue is letting go and trusting God.",

The main push of the message is that the gospel always begins and continues with repentance, and that the gospel preached without it is not the true gospel at all. \"Now, would it not be a master stroke of the enemy of the Christian faith to take the very first word of the gospel and change its meaning...well that's exactly what's been done.\"",

We all have hurts, oughts, problems in life, God knows this and therefore has given us the way to be free from unforgiveness. He speaks of mercy and the need to err on mercy rather then judgment. He ends the message with the declaration that we cannot forgive apart from God helping us.",

The practical, straight forward teaching from God's Word is wonderfully illustrated by answered prayers from the likes of George Muller, Watchman Nee and others.

It is a systematic religiousness that made His ways unrecognizable to mankind. The wrath of God is truly revealed when He sees man create a system of religion that robs the sinner of the treasure of His heart. The whole desire of God is that His house would be called a house of prayer, and the doors would be open so the outcasts of humanity could come in and find satisfaction to the deepest desires of their heart. God is calling His church to get out of the board rooms and into the prayer closet and cry out to Him to ignite us with the fire of the Holy Ghost and begin to move in His power one more time. Can we believe God to cleanse the temple one more time and awaken His church?",

We have millions a year that come to Christ but their life has no repentance.  You hardly even hear the word used in Evangelical, Baptist and Pentecostal churches today.  Just believe and you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re saved.  All of those messages are for naught without repentance.",

            "description": "Paul Washer sometimes expounds a number of different (but often related) topics in his sermons, and this message is no exception. Preaching in Denmark, he opens with a plea for men who have a zeal for the Lord\u2019s house, who will stand up and be counted, and will seize the opportunities for preaching the gospel while they exist. Moving on to Chapter 1 of Mark\u2019s gospel, he shows how demanding life can be for the zealous man of God, as exemplified in the ministry of Jesus Christ himself. If the Son of God could not live on earth without prayer and secret communion with his Father, how much less can we. He was never too busy to pray; nor should we be. Everything we are in public, is formed by what we are in private when we are alone with God, says Mr Washer; and he then goes on to use the Luke 18 passage to expound the topic of persevering prayer, showing both how and why we should endure in prayer, how God delights in it, and what it can achieve.

            "description": "It is my firm conviction that worldliness is destroying the church of Jesus Christ. The church is more and more becoming like the world, indistinguishable from the world, pursuers of the world, lovers of the world. Our relationship with Jesus Christ is hardly more than an appendage or appendix to our busy, worldly lives. We are no longer distinguished as separate, consecrated, pilgrims, sojourners, or holy unto the Lord; instead, we have eyes full of the world, hearts in love with the world, ears attentive to the world, lips filled with worldly speech, hands filled with worldly things, feet comfortable with worldly paths, and bodies no longer ready to depart and be with Jesus since that would mean giving up the world.",
