At the same time the Church in North Korea recognizes whom God has specifically gifted as shepherds. Such servant leaders are esteemed but not idolized.",

He has been building a pure pristine Book of Acts fellowship in House Church networks all over rural China. There is a simplicity to the move of God yet such fervency, love, and desire born in the hearts of these believers. We need to break out of the simple 1 hour church meeting patterns, and start to serve the Lord with full commitment like many of these precious brothers and sisters in the Lord. For many of us the questions and truths that are revealed are very important for us to hear as we gather under the Headship of Jesus Christ in local areas.",

We believe that as believers gather it is essential to pray for endowments of the Holy Spirit. If the presence of God is not with the Church, She will never further the purpose of God in the earth.",

The word offended means to be moved to leaning on your reasoning rather than trusting the plan that God has for your life. When difficulties and trails come you will be tempted to take another course and follow another Jesus. The key to avoid this is to have a deep abiding trust in the faithfulness of God, knowing that His ways are not our ways and He has a divine plan. Take comfort in knowing we are in hands that are much bigger than ours and we will be triumphed over. Jesus Christ promises us we will make it to the other side.",

Hard times are coming before the Lord comes for his people, and those who do not pray won't be ready or able to face it. People are too busy to pray, they praise the Lord but don't pray to him.

Before he came to KwaSizabantu he was in hospital and had a terrible experience. The people in his ward were very sick. One night he went to fetch himself some water to drink. When he came back to his bed, one of the patients begged him for some water. When he had fetched the water, the man didn't want to drink it, but asked mr Khoza to pour it onto his neck and chest, for he felt like he was burning. After that the next patient had the same request and then the next. It carried on for quite a while. The next morning two of the patients had passed away.

They found common ground in their enmity against Jesus. On the way to be crucified, history teaches us that Jesus was carrying His cross and fell down because He was weak from all the torture. The Bible doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t specifically say that but historians mention it. But the Bible does tell us that when He went to Gethsemane, He took with Him His disciples only to a certain point and three others a little further and left them too and He went still a little further and prayed earnestly, even so that His sweat drops were as blood. He was in a terrific battle, and He prayed and said, \"Father if it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s possible let this cup pass from Me, nevertheless not My will but Your will be done\". That cup was filled with your sin and my sin - the sin of the world. He Who is the Holy Son of God became sin for us! Jesus was fully man and fully God.",

In this message wilkerson addresses the deplorable situation in American homes and gives an urgent call for people to wake up and start to really live as a family should live. This message is counter-cultural and against the spirit of the age of progress and technology, simplier times are and were better.

His eschatological insight is a very needful truth to be realized in the body of Christ. \r\n\r\nArt was a prophetic voice insofar as he called his listeners to purposes in God that would affect both time and eternity, purposes that had to do with the glory of God in the Church.   Frequently, his messages called the Church to an awareness of the Last Days [End-times] in such a way that made that time seem imminent and at the door.",

Niranam has immense historical significance in the tradition of Saint Thomas, a disciple of Jesus Christ who planted the first church there in AD 52.  K.P. Yohannan dedicated his life to God at a young age to serve the needy and downtrodden. He prayed, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Oh my Lord, let my heart break with the things that break Your heart\u00e2\u20ac\u009d and his life was never the same. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s his belief that one can only demonstrate God\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s love by loving people. After over four decades of selfless service, he says, I have no regrets in praying that prayer for I know God has touched millions through what He did in and through me. It is all God\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s grace.\r\n\r\nHe spent the early years of his service in North India and traveled to the remote villages sharing the love of Christ and doing charitable works. Through numerous encounters during those years, he was instilled with an increasing passion to bring hope, peace, and comfort to the needy and deprived. His sacrificial commitment, farsightedness and aptitude to perceive helped him to lead a life of unhindered devotion to serve Christ and His church. K.P. Yohannan is also the voice of Athmeeya Yathra, touching millions through his daily radio and TV broadcasts. His 250 books offer practical and spiritual guidance on hundreds of subjects.",

A tradition dating from the 2nd century ascribes this book to John Mark, a companion of Peter and also of Paul and Barnabas in their missionary endeavors. The preaching of Peter may well have been the source of most of Mark\u2019s material. Mark accounts for the ministry of Jesus from His Baptism to His Ascension. Most commentaries agree that Mark\u2019s purpose was neither biographical nor historical, but theological: to present Jesus as the Christ, the mighty worker rather than great teacher. Hence, Mark makes fewer references to the Parables and discourses, but meticulously records each of Jesus\u2019 \"mighty works\" as evidence of His divine power. Mark contains 20 specific miracles and alludes to others. Bible scholars quite generally agree that Mark wrote his Gospel in Rome for the gentiles.",

Many other things we might give thee warning of (gentle Reader) if we had not exceeded the measure of a Preface already. It remaineth, that we commend thee to God, and to the Spirit of his grace, which is able to build further than we can ask or think. He removeth the scales from our eyes, the vail from our hearts, opening our wits that we may understand his word, enlarging our hearts, yea correcting our affections, that we may love it to the end. Ye are brought unto fountains of living water which ye digged not; do not cast earth into them with the Philistines, neither prefer broken pits before them with the wicked Jews. [Gen 26:15. Jer 2:13.] Others have laboured, and you may enter into their labours; O receive not so great things in vain, O despise not so great salvation! Be not like swine to tread under foot so precious things, neither yet like dogs to tear and abuse holy things. Say not to our Saviour with the Gergesites, Depart out of our coast [Matt 8:34]; neither yet with Esau sell your birthright for a mess of pottage [Heb 12:16]. If light be come into the world, love not darkness more than light; if food, if clothing be offered, go not naked, starve not yourselves. Remember the advice of Nazianzene, \"It is a grievous thing\" (or dangerous) \"to neglect a great fair, and to seek to make markets afterwards:\" also the encouragement of S. Chrysostom, \"It is altogether impossible, that he that is sober\" (and watchful) \"should at any time be neglected:\" [S. Chrysost. in epist. ad Rom. cap. 14. oral. 26.]\r\nLastly, the admonition and menacing of S. Augustine, \"They that despise God's will inviting them, shall feel God's will taking vengeance of them.\" [S. August. ad artic. sibi falso object. Artic. 16.] It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God; [Heb 10:31] but a blessed thing it is, and will bring us to everlasting blessedness in the end, when God speaketh unto us, to hearken; when he setteth his word before us, to read it; when he stretcheth out his hand and calleth, to answer, Here am I, here we are to do thy will, O God. The Lord work a care and conscience in us to know him and serve him, that we may be acknowledged of him at the appearing of our Lord Jesus Christ, to whom with the holy Ghost, be all praise and thanksgiving.

The practical, straight forward teaching from God's Word is wonderfully illustrated by answered prayers from the likes of George Muller, Watchman Nee and others.

Huegel's writings on the deeper aspects of Christ's work on Calvary and it's implications for the believer have blessed multitudes of Christians. This biography is written by his son, who states in his preface that he has deliberately tried not to present his father's life through rose colored glasses but rather give a true and accurate account--warts and all. Those who have benefited from Huegel's other writings will welcome this unique chance to get a look at the man behind the books. Highly recommended!\r\nHe is the author of the book: \"Bone of His Bone\": One of the most basic principles for a successful life as a Christian is that the individual must experience full dependency on Jesus--allow Christ to become part of him. In effect he must become Bone of His Bone. Don't miss these freshly edited studies on the indwelling Christ.",

Brother Beasley was a powerful preacher of the Word of God who ministered mostly in southern Baptist churches in America. The Lord gave him a gift of faith to trust the Lord in impossible circumstances for God's glory. Even though Manley Beasley was not very old as we measure a life's span, he left behind a legacy of faith that was rarely seen in his generation. We pray that he will be honored and the Lord glorified by this attempt to share this legacy with all who would live a life of faith that is truly pleasing to God.\r\nThere came a time when Manley believed the Lord gave him a choice of complete healing or daily healing. Manley chose daily healing because for him it was an act of faith that each day the Lord had to heal him to the point that he could get out of bed. During those years there were more confinements in the hospital, as well as trips to Europe and revivals all over the United States. He led Bible Conferences, revivals, and shared his personal testimony with others dealing with illness.",

It is a systematic religiousness that made His ways unrecognizable to mankind. The wrath of God is truly revealed when He sees man create a system of religion that robs the sinner of the treasure of His heart. The whole desire of God is that His house would be called a house of prayer, and the doors would be open so the outcasts of humanity could come in and find satisfaction to the deepest desires of their heart. God is calling His church to get out of the board rooms and into the prayer closet and cry out to Him to ignite us with the fire of the Holy Ghost and begin to move in His power one more time. Can we believe God to cleanse the temple one more time and awaken His church?",

We pray that he will be honored and the Lord glorified by this attempt to share this legacy with all who would live a life of faith that is truly pleasing to God.\r\nThere came a time when Manley believed the Lord gave him a choice of complete healing or daily healing. Manley chose daily healing because for him it was an act of faith that each day the Lord had to heal him to the point that he could get out of bed. During those years there were more confinements in the hospital, as well as trips to Europe and revivals all over the United States. He led Bible Conferences, revivals, and shared his personal testimony with others dealing with illness.",

Preaching in Denmark, he opens with a plea for men who have a zeal for the Lord\u2019s house, who will stand up and be counted, and will seize the opportunities for preaching the gospel while they exist. Moving on to Chapter 1 of Mark\u2019s gospel, he shows how demanding life can be for the zealous man of God, as exemplified in the ministry of Jesus Christ himself. If the Son of God could not live on earth without prayer and secret communion with his Father, how much less can we. He was never too busy to pray; nor should we be. Everything we are in public, is formed by what we are in private when we are alone with God, says Mr Washer; and he then goes on to use the Luke 18 passage to expound the topic of persevering prayer, showing both how and why we should endure in prayer, how God delights in it, and what it can achieve.

If we have areas in our life that has never been confronted by the Holy Ghost we will become passive in our walk with God and be moved to unbelief. The heart of Jesus is to come and do for us what we can\u2019t do for ourselves",

            "description": "It is my firm conviction that worldliness is destroying the church of Jesus Christ. The church is more and more becoming like the world, indistinguishable from the world, pursuers of the world, lovers of the world. Our relationship with Jesus Christ is hardly more than an appendage or appendix to our busy, worldly lives. We are no longer distinguished as separate, consecrated, pilgrims, sojourners, or holy unto the Lord; instead, we have eyes full of the world, hearts in love with the world, ears attentive to the world, lips filled with worldly speech, hands filled with worldly things, feet comfortable with worldly paths, and bodies no longer ready to depart and be with Jesus since that would mean giving up the world.",
