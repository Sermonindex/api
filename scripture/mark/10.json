            "description": "Christians in North Korea are expected to be servant leaders and Spirit filled, to share the Word, pray, and preach the Gospel. One of the reasons for the continued existence and growth of the underground Church in North Korea is that they have not been dependent on a few highly esteemed leaders in the Church but have rather emphasized the raising up of all to be servant leaders who are able to edify and build the Church. At the same time the Church in North Korea recognizes whom God has specifically gifted as shepherds. Such servant leaders are esteemed but not idolized.",

Have you yet come to the totality that is intrinsic to the call of God? After listening to this sermon, the answer will no longer elude you.",

God calls us to give up our present trust and walk with Him. What are you trusting in that keeps you locked out of the power of God's Kingdom? God's Kingdom is a NOW Kingdom and He beckons us to leave behind what we once trusted in, let go of all our baggage, and slip through the eye of the needle! It's the person who realizes he has nothing to offer God but a willing heart that slips through the Eye of the Needle. The issue is letting go and trusting God.",
