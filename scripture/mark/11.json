He was born in Newtownards, County Down, Ireland in 1911. In his book Tramp after God, he tells of living for more than three years as a tramp abusing alcohol and involved in crime. Willie Mullan had a religious conversion and from that time forward he decided he would strive to serve God.\r\n\r\n In 1953 Willie Mullan was called to Lurgan Baptist church, and in August of that year he commenced the work in Lurgan. One of his great accomplishments during this time was the Tuesday night Bible class. Every Tuesday night hundreds attended to hear the exposition of the Word. In 1957 William Hewitt and a team of helpers commenced the tape recordings of the Bible class. At least 1500 of these recordings remain until this day.",

Thus our forgiveness came at the greatest cost to Him the death of His Son, the Lord Jesus.  And it is not without a cost that we are to forgive others as we have been forgiven, to forgive means to forgoe our rights and to suffer the cost.  Pastor Hession shows that at the root of unforgiveness is pride saying 'I wont forgive this person, they have violated my rights!' and also that when we are wronged and forgive then when the person comes and ask forgiveness we will be able to say 'There is nothing to forgive' as it is an old account that has been settled, just as ours was on Calvary.",

It was like starting the Christian life over as he came humbly to the Cross.

Huegel's writings on the deeper aspects of Christ's work on Calvary and it's implications for the believer have blessed multitudes of Christians. This biography is written by his son, who states in his preface that he has deliberately tried not to present his father's life through rose colored glasses but rather give a true and accurate account--warts and all. Those who have benefited from Huegel's other writings will welcome this unique chance to get a look at the man behind the books. Highly recommended!\r\nHe is the author of the book: \"Bone of His Bone\": One of the most basic principles for a successful life as a Christian is that the individual must experience full dependency on Jesus--allow Christ to become part of him.

It is a systematic religiousness that made His ways unrecognizable to mankind. The wrath of God is truly revealed when He sees man create a system of religion that robs the sinner of the treasure of His heart. The whole desire of God is that His house would be called a house of prayer, and the doors would be open so the outcasts of humanity could come in and find satisfaction to the deepest desires of their heart. God is calling His church to get out of the board rooms and into the prayer closet and cry out to Him to ignite us with the fire of the Holy Ghost and begin to move in His power one more time.

She was used of the Lord to help found the Evangelical Sisterhood of Mary. The Lord has used her writings powerfully to help encourage the greater body of Christ of future sufferings for the Lord and how to endure them. Also one of the burdens of her ministry was to share in the sufferings of the Lord and share the sorrow that Jesus has for a lost world and a backslidden church.\r\n\r\n\"In heaven we will say, \u2018Do you remember the time we celebrated a festival of heaven on earth with Mother Basilea?'\" - Corrie ten Boom. \"To visit one of the Kanaan sanctuaries that they have assembled around the world is to visit a taste of the kingdom on earth.\" - Greg Gordon",

Brother Beasley was a powerful preacher of the Word of God who ministered mostly in southern Baptist churches in America. The Lord gave him a gift of faith to trust the Lord in impossible circumstances for God's glory. Even though Manley Beasley was not very old as we measure a life's span, he left behind a legacy of faith that was rarely seen in his generation. We pray that he will be honored and the Lord glorified by this attempt to share this legacy with all who would live a life of faith that is truly pleasing to God.\r\nThere came a time when Manley believed the Lord gave him a choice of complete healing or daily healing. Manley chose daily healing because for him it was an act of faith that each day the Lord had to heal him to the point that he could get out of bed. During those years there were more confinements in the hospital, as well as trips to Europe and revivals all over the United States. He led Bible Conferences, revivals, and shared his personal testimony with others dealing with illness.",
