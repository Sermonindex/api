            "description": "Debt and guilt are the same before God and it is a great debt that we owe Him due to our guilt before Him.  Thus our forgiveness came at the greatest cost to Him the death of His Son, the Lord Jesus.  And it is not without a cost that we are to forgive others as we have been forgiven, to forgive means to forgoe our rights and to suffer the cost.  Pastor Hession shows that at the root of unforgiveness is pride saying 'I wont forgive this person, they have violated my rights!' and also that when we are wronged and forgive then when the person comes and ask forgiveness we will be able to say 'There is nothing to forgive' as it is an old account that has been settled, just as ours was on Calvary.",

We all have hurts, oughts, problems in life, God knows this and therefore has given us the way to be free from unforgiveness. He speaks of mercy and the need to err on mercy rather then judgment. He ends the message with the declaration that we cannot forgive apart from God helping us.",

By 'law' he means characteristics or 'the realm of spiritual order' that govern prayer.  '[Even] grace has its mold of operation,' he said.  The practical, straight forward teaching from God's Word is wonderfully illustrated by answered prayers from the likes of George Muller, Watchman Nee and others.

            "description": "September 20, 2009 - Jesus faced the mountain of entrenched rebellion towards the ways of God. It is a systematic religiousness that made His ways unrecognizable to mankind. The wrath of God is truly revealed when He sees man create a system of religion that robs the sinner of the treasure of His heart. The whole desire of God is that His house would be called a house of prayer, and the doors would be open so the outcasts of humanity could come in and find satisfaction to the deepest desires of their heart. God is calling His church to get out of the board rooms and into the prayer closet and cry out to Him to ignite us with the fire of the Holy Ghost and begin to move in His power one more time. Can we believe God to cleanse the temple one more time and awaken His church?",
