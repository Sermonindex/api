The presence of God was bought with the Blood of Jesus as He endured the violence of the cross through a passionate love for humanity. May we never become familiar and careless with the His presence that was purchased for a with a passionate love of a father that sent His only Son to Die on a cross so that we can be free.",

            "description": "This is a vintage message of David Wilkerson preached at a youth rally in New York City. I believe it to be preached in the 60's and the recording was taken from a Record LP so there will be some background noise of the record due to quality. In this message wilkerson addresses the deplorable situation in American homes and gives an urgent call for people to wake up and start to really live as a family should live. This message is counter-cultural and against the spirit of the age of progress and technology, simplier times are and were better. I am sure many families will take much of the simple application into everyday life.",
