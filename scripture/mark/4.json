            "description": "This interview was conducted by brother Denny with two brothers who worked and are involved with the rural Chinese underground house Churches where God is doing a vibrant work. He has been building a pure pristine Book of Acts fellowship in House Church networks all over rural China. There is a simplicity to the move of God yet such fervency, love, and desire born in the hearts of these believers. We need to break out of the simple 1 hour church meeting patterns, and start to serve the Lord with full commitment like many of these precious brothers and sisters in the Lord. For many of us the questions and truths that are revealed are very important for us to hear as we gather under the Headship of Jesus Christ in local areas.",

            "description": "September 26, 2010 - Many in the last days will be offended. The word offended means to be moved to leaning on your reasoning rather than trusting the plan that God has for your life. When difficulties and trails come you will be tempted to take another course and follow another Jesus. The key to avoid this is to have a deep abiding trust in the faithfulness of God, knowing that His ways are not our ways and He has a divine plan. Take comfort in knowing we are in hands that are much bigger than ours and we will be triumphed over. Jesus Christ promises us we will make it to the other side.",

He discusses the parable of the sower, and the different types of ground. He covers very practical ways to tell how you are doing in Christ today. He ties the parable of the sower in with the fruit of the spirit. A very entertaining, informative and practical sermon.",

The disciples were caught in a storm, but Jesus was in their boat with them. There were other ships caught in the storm as well. But the disciples cried out in fear, not having the confidence, God was in their boat! The still didn't realize who Jesus was. We need to focus on those who need Jesus and are lost in this stormy world in these last days. No matter what storm we face as believers, we have Christ in the ship, so let's get away from the focus on self and focus on those around us who don't know the Savior! Woe to those who are at ease in Zion! (Amos 6:1).",
