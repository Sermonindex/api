The grief of God's heart is caused by those who are closest to Him and yet still have a heart full of unbelief. Wherever there is unbelief there is hopelessness and a wilderness. God promises that He will BE GOD TO US, we must trust Him and take Him at His word. God wants a simple determined faith that believes and takes hold of His promises.",

His character made him the true king, and the nominal king trembled before him. A man is not to be estimated according to his rank, but according to his character. The peerage which God recognises is arranged according to a man's justice and holiness. He is first before God and holy angels who is first in obedience; and he reigns and is made a king and a priest whom God hath sanctified and clothed with the fair white linen of a holy life. Be not covetous of worldly honors, for you will have honor enough even from wicked men if your lives are \u201choliness unto the Lord.\u201d Let it be written on John's tomb, if he needs an epitaph, \u201cHerod feared John.\u201d Only there is one better testimonial which any minister of the gospel might be glad to receive, and it is this: \u201cJohn did no miracle, but all things which he spake concerning this man were true.\u201d",
