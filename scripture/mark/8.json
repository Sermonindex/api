            "description": "The thought of any believer in Christ being martyred is something hard to bear. Yet from an eternal perspective the Iranian believers hold in high regard those who have laid down their lives for the cause of Christ. The stories of the martyrs in Iran are many. These are just a few:\r\nOn January 19, 1994, Haik disappeared from the streets of Tehran. The authorities reported his death to his family on January 30; he was stabbed 26 times in his chest: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Indeed, Haik gave his heart to Christ twice. Once when he invited Christ to his life as his Savior, and second, when his heart was torn apart for his faith in Christ.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d783",

We are not called to have the earth bless us, we are called to bless the earth. Our cry has to be \"Jesus, touch us and cause us to see what you see and feel what you feel! Lord, cause us to have something deeper than sporadic bursts of kindness.\" Our eyes should be opened to the compassion of Christ and our hands should be committed to make a difference in society. When we move out in this direction, there is a divine power imputed to us for the work of the Lord.",
