This is a timely word for our day when we are losing hope and seeing things decline rapidly in our nations.",

Wilkerson uses many scriptures in this sobering, yet very accurate message on the lack of prayer in the church. Many will fight for prayer in their schools, yet do not pray at home. Hard times are coming before the Lord comes for his people, and those who do not pray won't be ready or able to face it. People are too busy to pray, they praise the Lord but don't pray to him. He is a stranger among them in his own house. Convicting!!!!",
