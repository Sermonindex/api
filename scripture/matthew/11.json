David Wilkerson says, \"I am so glad that God didn't answer my prayers in the way that I asked him! I would not be here!\"  One thing that John did well, was to take his doubts to Jesus.  Jesus reaffirmed him of who he was and pressed him further, \"...blessed is he who is not offended because of me\"",

If this is the case, we will never be offended, no matter how \"forgotten\" we feel. Even our master Jesus exclaimed many times through the gospels 'blessed is he who is not offended in me'.",

The meek man Moses could not lead the children into the promised land, because of one instance of anger.  There is a warning to us in this example.  We can miss the opportunity to lead family, friends, and others to the Lord by one instance of walking out of the character of Christ.
