You know, that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the mark of true Christian.  He examines himself in the presence of God and he judges no man.  Jesus was like that.  But it would be good, and it is good, and it must be good for us to examine ourselves, or to let God examine us.  \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Examine yourselves, whether ye be in the faith, whether Christ be in you.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve been sitting here praying for this one thing: that God might help in these days for us to see our great need.

As long as we try to fix up the old, we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll only make an awful job out of it.

Are you offended by Christ? We pray and doubt that God can hear us, or answer our prayers. so we have unfulfilled expectations. God responds to us, \"You are offended by the way I am bringing about my kingdom\" You have need of patience after you have done the will of the father to receive the promise. David Wilkerson says, \"I am so glad that God didn't answer my prayers in the way that I asked him! I would not be here!\"  One thing that John did well, was to take his doubts to Jesus.  Jesus reaffirmed him of who he was and pressed him further, \"...blessed is he who is not offended because of me\"",

It is easy to become offended at God when He moves in ways that we do not expect -- especially if He does not seem to be moving at all! But, our heart's cry should be to know Him.  If this is the case, we will never be offended, no matter how \"forgotten\" we feel. Even our master Jesus exclaimed many times through the gospels 'blessed is he who is not offended in me'.",

            "description": "Very good message defining the importance of \"meekness.\" \"Meekness is not weakness.\" This is a must hear sermon by Carter Conlon on meekness.  The heart of the message is about the need for each of us to walk in meekness in order to lead others to Jesus.  The meek man Moses could not lead the children into the promised land, because of one instance of anger.  There is a warning to us in this example.  We can miss the opportunity to lead family, friends, and others to the Lord by one instance of walking out of the character of Christ.  Carter used Mathew 11:28 when Jesus said, \u201cI am meek and lowly of heart.\u201d  Carter also used Mathew 5 Jesus said, \u201cblessed are the meek\u201d but the main text he used was the story of Moses hitting the rock in anger and the inability of Moses to then lead others into the promised land.",
