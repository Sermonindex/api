The father of Neo- Orthodoxy was Karl Barth a Swiss theologian, who having rebounded from outright liberalism became the hope of many Evangelicals. Instead, he was the pied piper who led them to their destruction. In this message you will learn that the existentialism of Neo-Orthodoxy has led to a play-dough religion. While orthodoxy stands rock solid on the truth that is timeless, New Evangelicals have fallen headlong into the sinking sands of subjectivism. Learn how Barthianism ruined so many denominations and promising evangelicals. Learn why Canada's voice for Orthodoxy has been all but silenced. Again we ask, Where are the preachers? This message will tell us why.",

And that presence will produce in a hungry soul an ever increasing revelation of who Christ is. This is often revealed in us and to us through suffering and trials. We have this great kingdom which cannot be moved, such great victory, and power living in us. Pastor Conlon goes through many other scriptures revealing how the Lord Jesus Christ is our Treasure. The person drawing closer to Him, cannot help being awed by Him, and at the same time painfully aware of their own sinful flesh in comparison. If your heart is toward Christ he knows, and he will not let the enemy overwhelm you as you trust in him. Pursuit of an ever increasing knowledge and intimacy with Christ should be the Christian's number one priority. When we get careless with the word of God and prayer, tragedy can come. The devil is always after the treasure of the presence of Christ in your life. Pastor Conlon warns: There is no greater danger than to become careless with this Book!",

            "description": "The kingdom of God is not an exterior kingdom, it is interior. The Kingdom of God is within us. Jesus said the Kingdom of God has nothing to do with outward show. It is a work that God is doing in us. It is Christ Himself coming into our heart to sit down and commune with us and bring us into the plan of God. The Kingdom is an interior work of God does in the heart. When the kingdom of God is set up in our heart we will put all our dreams at the feet of Jesus and be moved with compassion to leave our security until we finds the lost sheep and bring them home to the Father's House. Will you open up your heart to the cry of this generation? It starts with this cry: THY KINGDOM COME!",
