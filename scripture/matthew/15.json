And, behold, a woman of Canaan came out of the same coasts, and cried unto him, saying, Have mercy on me, O Lord, thou Son of David, my daughter is grievously vexed with a devil. But he answered her not a word. And his disciples came and besought him, saying, Send her away; for she crieth after us. But he answered and said, I am not sent but unto the lost sheep of the house of Israel. Then came she and worshipped him, saying, Lord, help me. But he answered and said, It is not meet to take the children's bread, and to cast it to dogs. And she said, Truth, Lord: yet the dogs eat of the crumbs which fall from their masters' table. Then Jesus answered and said unto her, O woman great is thy faith: be it unto thee even as thou wilt. And her daughter was made whole from that very hour.' - Matthew 15:21-28. WE learn from this chapter, dear friends, that our Master was tired of battling with hypocrites and formalists, and therefore withdrew himself from them. They had come to him with their foolish charges that his disciples did not observe the traditions of the elders, and they made a great fuss about meats, and drinks, and washing of hands, and all sorts of trifles...",

Matthew 15:9,10 is a reference to Isaiah 29:13, which tells of a time when the leaders in Israel were teaching the fear of the LORD by the precept of men. In our times, like in the days of Israel, something has been lost in the Body of Christ and it is the reverence for a Holy God. Many do not fear Him. They have a Satanic pride and arrogance birthed from a Gospel of Humanism. Men worship a \u2018God\u2019 of their own making; a God who they feel is a means to their own end.",

In this insightful and thought provoking book, Robert Wurtz II traces the history of Christian evangelism from the book of Acts to modern times. The contrast between pre-1900 and post-1900 evangelism is so sharp, that the book is divided into two sections: Part 1, the pre-Billy Sunday era and Part 2, the post-Billy Sunday evangelistic era.

They are always afraid that we shall offend other hearers. Hence, if the truth be spoken in a plain and pointed manner, and seems to come close home to the conscience, they think that surely it ought not to have been spoken, because So-and-so, and So-and-so, and So-and so took offense at it. Truly, my brethren, we are not all slow to answer in this matter. If we never offended, it would be proof positive that we did not preach the gospel.
