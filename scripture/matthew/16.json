Yohannan, the Metropolitan Bishop of Believers Church, was born and brought up in Niranam, Kerala. Niranam has immense historical significance in the tradition of Saint Thomas, a disciple of Jesus Christ who planted the first church there in AD 52.  K.P. Yohannan dedicated his life to God at a young age to serve the needy and downtrodden. He prayed, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Oh my Lord, let my heart break with the things that break Your heart\u00e2\u20ac\u009d and his life was never the same. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s his belief that one can only demonstrate God\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s love by loving people. After over four decades of selfless service, he says, I have no regrets in praying that prayer for I know God has touched millions through what He did in and through me. It is all God\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s grace.\r\n\r\nHe spent the early years of his service in North India and traveled to the remote villages sharing the love of Christ and doing charitable works. Through numerous encounters during those years, he was instilled with an increasing passion to bring hope, peace, and comfort to the needy and deprived. His sacrificial commitment, farsightedness and aptitude to perceive helped him to lead a life of unhindered devotion to serve Christ and His church. K.P. Yohannan is also the voice of Athmeeya Yathra, touching millions through his daily radio and TV broadcasts. His 250 books offer practical and spiritual guidance on hundreds of subjects.",

Spurgeon, \"Jesus bears not the cross so that you may escape it, but that you may endure it,\" this sermon delivers a message which adopts and adheres the previous two messages into our own bearing of the cross.  It is stated herein that one of the greatest libels against the cross in our day is the idea that the believer in the cross is absented from any form of suffering.  It is the cruciform life which will generate a necessary friction against the kingdoms of this world.  We must apprehend that this conflict is an intention of God through his people, and in every sense, a diet of the things of this world will by nature slicken any apprehension of this cross-centered friction.   The hearing of this sermon in its deepest of intentions will bring you face to face with Jesus calling you Satan, that is to say...you are Satanic if you cherish not the things of God over the things of man. We are admonished to take up the cross and follow Christ for, \"Natural man is always the instrument by which Satanic things are brought into being in the collision between kingdoms.\"",

A very bright, young man applied to teach at a Bible College. He had done very well in his studies. The director gave him pruning shears and took him to an orchard. He told him to prune a tree in the wrong way. Then he waited to see what the young man would do; whether he would follow his knowledge or do what the director had told him to do. The young man did as he had been told and received the post. He was highly qualified but if he had not been able to bow and obey, he would have been unfit for the post. In the College of the Holy Spirit you will not succeed if you do it your own way. You have to be able to obey.",

When our sin nature is mixed with the revelation of Jesus Christ we will become \"as God\" to ourselves and others. When our will and affections are set upon our fallen nature we will become an offense to Christ and we will be tempted to pursue a coarse that will lead to ruin. To be a disciple of Jesus we must be totally abandoned to the Will and Purposes of God and follow the PATHWAY that He has chose for us.
