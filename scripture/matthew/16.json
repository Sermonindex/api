            "description": "Starting with a quote from C.H. Spurgeon, \"Jesus bears not the cross so that you may escape it, but that you may endure it,\" this sermon delivers a message which adopts and adheres the previous two messages into our own bearing of the cross.  It is stated herein that one of the greatest libels against the cross in our day is the idea that the believer in the cross is absented from any form of suffering.  It is the cruciform life which will generate a necessary friction against the kingdoms of this world.  We must apprehend that this conflict is an intention of God through his people, and in every sense, a diet of the things of this world will by nature slicken any apprehension of this cross-centered friction.   The hearing of this sermon in its deepest of intentions will bring you face to face with Jesus calling you Satan, that is to say...you are Satanic if you cherish not the things of God over the things of man. We are admonished to take up the cross and follow Christ for, \"Natural man is always the instrument by which Satanic things are brought into being in the collision between kingdoms.\"",

A very bright, young man applied to teach at a Bible College. He had done very well in his studies. The director gave him pruning shears and took him to an orchard. He told him to prune a tree in the wrong way. Then he waited to see what the young man would do; whether he would follow his knowledge or do what the director had told him to do. The young man did as he had been told and received the post. He was highly qualified but if he had not been able to bow and obey, he would have been unfit for the post. In the College of the Holy Spirit you will not succeed if you do it your own way. You have to be able to obey.",

When our will and affections are set upon our fallen nature we will become an offense to Christ and we will be tempted to pursue a coarse that will lead to ruin. To be a disciple of Jesus we must be totally abandoned to the Will and Purposes of God and follow the PATHWAY that He has chose for us.
