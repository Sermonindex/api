From John 3:16, Matthew 20:28, Acts 20:35, he asks us to note four truths: 1) the father gave his Son, 2) the Son gave his life, 3) they did so in order that we might be ransomed, and 4) it is more blessed to give than to receive. Dr. Tozer then considers who we might want to thank some day for the gifts that they gave to Jesus. The wise men gave gold (lasting treasure), frankincense (worship), and myrrh (bitter sacrifice); Mary gave her mortal body; Joseph gave his faith; the shepherds gave their reverent wonder; Lazarus and his sisters, Mary and Martha, gave the welcome of their home; the women following Jesus gave a seamless, linen robe; and Joseph of Arimathaea gave his own, new grave. These are the gifts that they gave to Jesus. What might we give him that we might not be outdone in giving?",

            "description": "Brother Gehard shares on the diferences between humility and pride. God lifts up the humble person. He will be highly respected by his fellow man as he is with God. Humility is the opposite of self-centred pride. If you are humble, you consider yourself the servant of others. You do not feel or act superior to others and you are not a respecter of persons.",
