            "description": "Jim Cymbala passionately appeals to the example of Jesus and the church in the Book of Acts as a pattern for prayer in the Church.  In a day when more people are turning to crack than to Christ, he warns that real revival must have a praying people.  When the church today is being inundated with technicians, specialists and methodologies, the answer is not in these but in the power of the Holy Spirit through believing petition.  Cymbala closes by testifying to the God who answers prayer, sharing a very personal account of his wayward daughter brought back to the Lord in a glorious way.",

God wants us to come to him for the Holy Ghost as a people that will not be denied, that will rise up in faith and lay hold on the promises God has made, and appropriate and apply the spiritual authority given to us by Jesus. Pastor Conlon goes on to Mark 9:17-30. The casual seeker of God will never know the power of being able to walk in the spirit as Jesus did and be a vessel God can channel his power through to deliver those oppressed and bound by the enemy. A Message of obtainable victory. Must hear.",

From Matthew 21 where Jesus overthrew the tables and ran the moneychangers out of the temple, to 2nd Chronicles 6 and 7 when Solomon built the temple and dedicated it, the purpose of the temple is explained in depth. This is a real eye-opener on prayer. Just as the religious Pharisees were ineffective and uncaring for the lost, with no real compassion, today many Christians are caught up in worldly things, while their family and friends are lost,  too busy to pray as they should. Jesus said his house should be a house of prayer and we are the temple of God. Are we houses of prayer? Do we pray as we should?",

The Kingdom is an interior work of God does in the heart. When the kingdom of God is set up in our heart we will put all our dreams at the feet of Jesus and be moved with compassion to leave our security until we finds the lost sheep and bring them home to the Father's House.
