Yet in the early Church and Biblical record, God calls the people themselves the Church.629\r\nOne of the main desires in church planting in North America is the constructing of a church building after a group of believers is established. This is not always helpful. The true work of God is not dependent on money and resources to grow but rather on hearts that have been affected by the Gospel of our Lord. If we focus on building structures and churches, we can subtly deceive the people to depend on such structures630 and not the living Lord.",

They all still meet together on Sunday mornings to hear the main pastor teach, but these small groups also act as functioning Churches. These pastors of the small groups are perhaps not as well-trained or capable from a human perspective but this servant leader saw the heart of God to raise up brothers and sisters, to encourage and lead the body of Christ.",

It's going to be an ordinary day, when people are just going about their buisness as usual when he comes, just as it was in Noah's and Lot's day. You have been made ruler over your house; are you watching for their souls as one who must give account?",

Much of the church is fast asleep as the foolish virgins with no oil were, in Matt. 25. How do you know if you are ready? Get your eyes on Jesus, focus on his purposes for your life, not the things of this world, (Col 3:1-3), Stay in the Word daily; seeking him, for how shall you escape if you neglect so great a salvation? (Heb. 2:3). Settle every grudge, forgive those who have hurt you and don't be a smiter or unbeliever!\u00a0If you really BELIEVE he's coming, does your life reflect that? Or are you at ease in Zion? Pray before you listen to this, and while you listen to this, for the Holy Spirit to shed his Light in your heart.",

Truth seekers are those that worship God acceptably, but we must be careful of falling into the error of by our own human minds diserning and doubting all that is of God.",

First, the voice of God will never promise us peace if we are embracing the same value system of the world. Second, the voice of God will challenge sin. In the dark days ahead the people of God will be lead into the tender mercies of God. God will give us a heart full of confidence when we choose to live uprightly.",

Spiritual things should be the first priority in our lives and we should live for God's purpose, separated from the world. The Lord is coming for those wise servants that prepared themselves for His coming. They were looking for His coming. The foolish servant is living for the temporal and is not looking for the Lord's coming. The wise servant is one that is filled with the Holy Spirit. The wise servant uses the Lord's talents to advance the kingdom of God. In Summary: Our attitude towards His coming must be right. We must be filled with the Spirit.

The future of the true church of Jesus Christ will have a heavenly vision. Who then is the faithful and wise servant? The servant who is one in heart and one with the purposes of God. The wise servant will have their hands stretched out to heal and touch those around them with the supernatural power that can come only by God's Spirit. Those that will have spiritual sight in the last days will have a willingness to be sent by God as a vessel to be poured out and broken for lost humanity.",

Bliss and his wife died in a railroad accident. He was 38. His death was a great shock to the Christian world. Moody himself said what a disappointment it was for him. But he also said that from the time he heard that he was to take the memorial service there was just one thing running in his mind, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153therefore be ye also ready\u00e2\u20ac\u009d. When Kjell heard that u. Friedel was so sick in Switzerland he and his friends prayed for him every day that God would touch and heal him and at one point, Kjell said, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153maybe one of us will go first\u00e2\u20ac\u009d. Moody continued and challenged the audience to be ready before the close of this service. Ask yourself the question, are you ready to meet God?",

The Kingdom is an interior work of God does in the heart.
