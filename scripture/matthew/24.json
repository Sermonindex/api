The Lord is coming for those wise servants that prepared themselves for His coming. They were looking for His coming. The foolish servant is living for the temporal and is not looking for the Lord's coming. The wise servant is one that is filled with the Holy Spirit.

Was a Christian missionary, teacher, writer, and advocate of economic development in impoverished nations. A spiritual crisis during this period\u2014as he described two decades later in what is probably his best-known recorded teaching, \"Ten Shekels and a Shirt\"--left Reidhead with the conviction that much of evangelicalism had adopted utilitarian and humanistic philosophies contradictory to Biblical teaching. The end of all being, he came to believe, was not the happiness of man, but the glorification of God. This theme would recur throughout his later teaching.\r\n\r\nSince Mr. Reidhead's death in 1992, Bible Teaching Ministries, Inc. continues under the leadership of his wife, Marjorie, and daughter, Virginia Teitt, a dedicated Board, and the many people who have donated time and talent after being changed by God\u2019s Word through this message. The message of the Gospel is reaching an ever-widening audience all over the world.",

Tozer discusses the end of the world, the end of civilization, the difference between the two, and why so many accuse Jesus of failing to keep a promise of world peace. \u201cThey create a Christianity of their own, and then they try to make Christ conform to their own, homemade Christianity. \u2026 It may surprise some of you to know that our Lord Jesus Christ never promised peace\u2014world peace, peace among the nations\u2014during this age.\u201d Christians shouldn\u2019t blame the church, either. The pastor addresses a range of other vital issues in this excellent sermon, reading from Job 23:6, Psalm 85:8, and Matthew 24:4-14. \u201cThe New Year As God Sees It\u201d was preached the night of New Year\u2019s Eve, 1961, in Toronto, Ontario. The length of the recording is 41 minutes and 7 seconds.",

He was involved in the missionary alliance movement for most of his pulpit life. A.W. Tozer lived in the presence of God he saw clearly and he spoke as a prophet to the church. He sought for God's honor with the zeal of Elijah and mourned with Jeremiah at the apostasy of God's people. \r\n\r\nLeonard Ravenhill was a close friend of pastor and writer A. W. Tozer and spoke of him as one of the most influential voices in the Church in America. A.W. Tozer's materials are a mainstay in Evangelical churches in our day and he is one of the most quoted authors. He was a prophet in his day and his writings are even more influential in our day.

Bliss and his wife died in a railroad accident. He was 38. His death was a great shock to the Christian world. Moody himself said what a disappointment it was for him. But he also said that from the time he heard that he was to take the memorial service there was just one thing running in his mind, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153therefore be ye also ready\u00e2\u20ac\u009d. When Kjell heard that u. Friedel was so sick in Switzerland he and his friends prayed for him every day that God would touch and heal him and at one point, Kjell said, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153maybe one of us will go first\u00e2\u20ac\u009d. Moody continued and challenged the audience to be ready before the close of this service. Ask yourself the question, are you ready to meet God?",
