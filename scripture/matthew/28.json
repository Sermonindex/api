Their cry to go and make new disciples is backed up with their very lives. In many cases if they speak to the wrong person about Jesus, they face prison, torture and even death. The task of sharing the Gospel is for every Christian, even if they give their life as a martyr. Chinese Christians teach us that when their seed (their life) has gone into the ground and died it will multiply and produce much more fruit.544 With their blood new growth is coming. The seed, their body that died now produces 100 fold, 1000 fold or even more.",

He then considers the men who first received this commission, and the necessity of their transformation at Pentecost. Our attention is then drawn to the Christ of the Great Commission, especially his unlimited, unhindered, unending authority over all (v.18). Jesus referred to himself as the Son of Man many times, to show us who he really was, the fulfilment of Daniel\u2019s vision (Dan.7:13,14). There is only one true King and kingdom in the world today; lose sight of his sovereignty, and you lose the hope of missions. Finally Mr. Washer examines the commission itself - its foundation, commands, and effects - and asks whether our own lives and ministries are worthy of being exported to nations that have already been ravaged and confused by our false doctrines, false gospels, false evangelists, carnality and worldliness. He ends with a passionate plea for missions and missionaries, and an exhortation to confidence in the One who said, \u201cLo, I am with you alway\u201d (v.20). That\u2019s not a promise, he says, it\u2019s a FACT.  (79 minutes).",

Firstly, Paul Washer explains how the disciples must have felt as Jesus came to them after his resurrection: weak, doubting, and so aware that all their claims to devotion had failed. Yet how patient God is, and Mr Washer expounds the blessed promises concerning the smoking flax and bruised reed. He then says that much of today\u2019s preaching takes away from the glory of Christ, because it puts into the future what the New Testament declares is now. Christ said, All power is (now) given unto me. Turning to Psalm 2, Mr.Washer shows how and why the heathen rage against the gospel of Jesus Christ; but God mocks them, for he has established his King, and all authority is given to Him. We should not fear those who oppose the gospel, not should we be angry; we should pity them \u2013 and Mr Washer shares his own experience when arrested by police in Peru. He then expounds \u2018the Son of Man\u2019 (Daniel 7:13) in the context of Christ\u2019s kingdom. Conspiracy theories? There are no such thing! says Mr Washer; man can do NOTHING unless Jesus Christ decrees it. Jesus Christ is king, NOW!  71 minutes.",

Scientists say that when you look at pornography there are chemicals that are automatically released in the brain which changes the brain in such a way that it alters it's structure. Porn rewires you. Adam and Eve didn't know they were naked, but when they sinned they became aware of it and were ashamed. God Himself then slaughtered an animal and clothed them with the skins. This was a pointer towards the time when Jesus would be slaughtered for our sins on the Cross. The Bible says marriage should be honoured by all and the marriage bed undefiled, for God will judge the adulterers (Hebrews 13:4). Pornography is an evil drug, worse than dagga (marijuana) and many other drugs. Looking at pornography makes you a slave to it. It's easier to stop smoking or drinking than to get free from pornography.",
