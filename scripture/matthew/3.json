Because of satanic counterfeits, the true body of Christ has been alarmed and made hesitant to call out to the Lord for a fresh infusion of God\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Spirit in a public meeting or private prayer time. We believe that as believers gather it is essential to pray for endowments of the Holy Spirit. If the presence of God is not with the Church, She will never further the purpose of God in the earth.",

One might wonder what it meant, for surely Abraham, the father of believers, or Moses or Elijah was greater than he? In what does his greatness lie? In the Old Testament it ends with the prophet Malachi, after which there was silence for 400 years until John arrived on the scene. God sent John. It is said that he grew up in the wilderness of Judea. There were only five or six small villages in Judea. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re not told exactly where he grew up. We read of the Lord Jesus in Jerusalem, but nothing of John the baptist. He was all the while in the wilderness. Even his birth was miraculous, in that he was filled with the Holy Spirit while still in his mother\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s womb!",

There are both Baptists and Dutch Reformed people who gossip, slander and ruin other's characters by their tongue. The Holy Spirit: When the Holy Spirit descended on Jesus He descended as a dove, but when He descended on the disciples at Pentecost, He descended as tongues of fire, signifying that the first to be touched and transformed when a person is baptised with the Holy Spirit is a person's tongue.",
