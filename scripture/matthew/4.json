            "description": "There is a look that kills. Things may look good but not be good for you. Lot thought it looked good to go toward Sodom and Gomorrah, but he lost everything he had there. There's a way that looks right to man but the end of it is death. Looks can be deceiving. The lust of man's flesh, the sight of the eyes and the pride of life are examined carefully.",

The main push of the message is that the gospel always begins and continues with repentance, and that the gospel preached without it is not the true gospel at all. \"Now, would it not be a master stroke of the enemy of the Christian faith to take the very first word of the gospel and change its meaning...well that's exactly what's been done.\"",

            "description": "There are very few messages on repentance these days. Contemporary churches would rather appease the congregation than to preach the offense of the cross. There is a thirst all around the world today for truth. The only way for people to be healed and enter into the power and rest of Christ is through repentance. The Holy Spirit is grieved at those who never enter into the Joy of Jesus through repentance. The devil is after the fruitfulness and Christ likeness in our lives. The devil will send foxes to hinder our fruitfulness. Jesus will come and call us to rise up with Him and He will battle for us and go after these foxes. We must be fully convinced of the love of God and His desire to fight against our enemies and to keep us by His power. He will do battle with us and for us.",
