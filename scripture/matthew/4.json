Willie Mullan had a religious conversion and from that time forward he decided he would strive to serve God.\r\n\r\n In 1953 Willie Mullan was called to Lurgan Baptist church, and in August of that year he commenced the work in Lurgan. One of his great accomplishments during this time was the Tuesday night Bible class. Every Tuesday night hundreds attended to hear the exposition of the Word. In 1957 William Hewitt and a team of helpers commenced the tape recordings of the Bible class. At least 1500 of these recordings remain until this day.",

The Holy Spirit is grieved at those who never enter into the Joy of Jesus through repentance. The devil is after the fruitfulness and Christ likeness in our lives. The devil will send foxes to hinder our fruitfulness. Jesus will come and call us to rise up with Him and He will battle for us and go after these foxes.
