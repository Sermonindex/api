            "description": "Another Christian Pastor Farshid Fathi has been detained in prison since December 2010. He was charged with possessing religious propaganda. The evidence presented by the regime was that Pastor Fathi had Bibles printed in Farsi, that he had unlawfully distributed Bibles, and that he possessed Christian literature. The regime argued that his Christian activities were equivalent to actions against national security. Pastor Fathi is presently serving a 6-year sentence in Iran\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s notorious Evin prison. His crime is being a Christian and freely exercising his faith. Pastor Fathi has a wife Leila and two children, Rosana and Bardia. They suffer with him.",

SPURGEON, AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON. \u201cWhat do ye more than others?\u201d \u2014 Matthew 5:47. IT is a very great fault in any ministry if the doctrine of justification by faith alone be not most clearly taught. I will go further, and add, that it is not only a great fault, but a fatal one; for souls will never find their way to heaven by a ministry that is indistinct upon the most fundamental of gospel truths. We are justified by faith, and not by the works of the law. The merit by which a soul enters heaven is not its own; it is the merit of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. I am quite sure that you will all hold me guiltless of ever having spoken about this great doctrine in any other than unmistakable language; if I have erred, it is not in that direction. At the same time, it is a dangerous state of things if doctrine is made to drive out precept, and faith is held up as making holiness a superfluity. Sanctification must not be forgotten or overlaid by justification. We must teach plainly that the faith which saves the soul is not a dead faith, but a faith which operates with purifying effect upon our entire nature, and produces in us fruits of righteousness to the praise and glory of God. It is not by personal holiness that a man shall enter heaven, but yet without holiness shall no man see the Lord.",

Many preachers say little more about meekness than showing that is not weakness; but what does the word really mean? The true meaning of any word is defined not merely through a dictionary, but by studying the context of the passage(s) where it occurs; so, using the obvious parallels between Matthew 5:5 and Psalm 37:11, Mr Washer uses the context of Psalm 37:1-11 to define the word \u2018meek\u2019. He works through the verses one by one, revealing the character of the meek man: he does not fret, nor envy the wicked; he trusts in God and dwells in the land; he delights himself in the Lord, commits his way unto the Lord, rests in the Lord, and so on. \u201cThis is what it means to be meek\u201d, says Mr Washer, \u201cand it is one of our greatest needs today\u201d.

And it is not without a cost that we are to forgive others as we have been forgiven, to forgive means to forgoe our rights and to suffer the cost.  Pastor Hession shows that at the root of unforgiveness is pride saying 'I wont forgive this person, they have violated my rights!' and also that when we are wronged and forgive then when the person comes and ask forgiveness we will be able to say 'There is nothing to forgive' as it is an old account that has been settled, just as ours was on Calvary.",

            "description": "Throughout this beautiful and anointed message, Jackie shares many wonderful testimonies of the work of the Holy Spirit saving, healing and delivering drug addicts, prostitutes and criminals in the Wall City in Hong Kong. She speaks about the revival in China, and how teenage girls leave their homes and walk from village to village sharing Jesus. They come back two years later and multitudes have accepted Christ. These girls have never been to a seminar or a worship service. They simply give everything they have away. Jackie also witnesses about brothers and sisters coming out of decades in prison with broken bodies many times, but rejoicing and shining in their Saviour. She emphasizes that the revival in China is not facilitated by visual aids, life changing tapes, videos of the month or Christian magazines. It comes through the Holy Spirit using \"just a few people who aren't very educated, without microphones, who loved their lives not unto death - that's it.\" In this way, God has chosen the foolish things of the world to shame the wise (1 Corinthians 1:26-27). Jesus came to preach the good news to the poor (Luke 4:18). Jackie explains how the poor are often able to hear the gospel much quicker than an educated person, because they can hear spiritually. This is why the poor in spirit are blessed (Matthew 5:3). Jackie Pullinger emphasizes that men and women are saved through the Spirit of God, not through man's reasoning. She concludes with a call to die and a profound challenge: \"His glory will fall if you go out with nothing except a broken heart and some precious seed, and I suppose we have all got that.\"",

Jesus corrects the misunderstanding and calls for total commitment from His disciples. Loving our neighbors and even our enemies according to God\u00c2\u2019s standards is impossible, except for one thing: we have Jesus living in us.",

We must let God use our mourning to move us in three ways. First, mourning helps us ask the right questions about life. Second, it helps us to seek God\u00c2\u2019s answers. Third, it also helps us to accept the blessing God has provided including our salvation.",

Those who become ministers of reconciliation often suffer painful consequences because they have identified themselves with Jesus Christ.

The disciple who has the\u00c2\u201cbeautiful attitudes\u00c2\u201d confronts people with a model of what they should be. When people in theworld are confronted with a true disciple, they can acknowledge that this is how they should live, or they can attack the disciple who is like Jesus. Very often, they do the latter.",

He reads the entire Sermon on the mount and then focuses soley on the verse Matthew 5:13 which he believes would be the verse that Christ would want to bring to his church in our day. He gives the direct call for us to become the salt in the earth once again. You will [b]not[\/b] be the same again after you hear this message, harden not your hearts.",

            "description": "From the scripture Matthew 5:14, Glyn Owen frankly and honestly shows the spiritual signifigance of these words from our masters lips. It is shown that in our day and age there is a landslide of immortality that overshadows anything that has happened in the near past. Children in society are being raised with high mental and physical standards but morally are being feed sewage in contrast. He gives a very straight forward call for the Church to be that positive agent, saline and different then the world so we can have a positive effect on it morally and bring glory to the name of God. He mentions about Holiness and many other things, this sermon is one of utmost importance to listen to for the nomial Chrisitan in our day.",

Paul says, \"I want to present you as a chaste virgin to Christ\" (2Cor 11:2). The importance of purity has been lost these days.

We will have a greater love than the world knows and show greater grace and mercy than the world understands. In so doing, we will become like our Father in heaven.",

The standard to which we hold ourselves is often worlds apart from what is required by our Lord.

Herein lies an exhortation to seriously consider what a work of God really is, and what will truly glorify him.  In order to truly cover the naked, and be Eunuch\u2019s for God, we must operate out of his utter rest.",

Jesus makes a clear declaration for His church on this side of eternity that we are the salt of the earth and the light in a dark world. If our heart is one with God's heart, God will work supernaturally through us and we will become a living testimony for the redemption of man. The very life we live should create a thirst for the living God and His light should be seen in us.",

But it is the light of our testimony that will reveal the living God to a world that needs Him so desperately.",
