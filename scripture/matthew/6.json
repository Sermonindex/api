When you become a child of God you cannot say, \"I serve Him in my own way - you do your thing and I'll do mine\". Such a person is on the wrong track. When we are born again we become part of God's spiritual family. When Jesus' mother and brothers wanted to speak to Him while He was preaching, He replied \"who is my mother, and who are my brethren?\". Then He pointed to His disciples and said, \"whosoever will do the will of My Father in heaven, the same is my brother and sister and mother\". The spiritual family is much more important than the physical blood family. If your child is not in the will of God, you are far apart from him, while another child who serves God, even not your blood-family, is much closer to you.",

He doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know the day His Father will tell Him to fetch His bride. Will He find you ready when His Father tells Him to fetch His bride? The Bible says He will come as a thief in the night. You do not know when a thief will come and so you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know when He would come. You must be prepared at all times.",

When we sit under the true preaching of God's Word and then embrace a lie, sin and religion become friends. It is that inner struggle that we all have to face from time to time when we come to a minimal understanding of the ways of God, and yet in our own heart we think we might know a better way than the one God has planned for us. There is incredible power in the deceptiveness of the human heart. God is calling us to be single focused and to agree with His truth so that our heart will not be veiled with the deceit of religion. When we turn, with all of our heart, to the Lord, the veil is lifted and our lives become a testimony of His goodness and power.",
