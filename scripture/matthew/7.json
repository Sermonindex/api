The closing words of  what some men choose to call \u2018The Sermon On The Mount\u2019 are a perfect example of this sword at work, dividing between strait and wide; narrow and broad; good trees and bad trees; good fruit and bad fruit; those that hear Jesus\u2019 words and do them, and those that hear Jesus\u2019 words and do them not; life and death; salvation and destruction; heaven and hell. As Mr Washer asserts, these are indeed fearful words, and he expounds them clearly and powerfully to the end that his hearers should be left in no doubt as to the eternal consequences of Jesus\u2019 teaching. How many preachers \u2018blunt\u2019 this sword in their attempts to make the message more \u2018acceptable\u2019 (as they think) to men; but Mr Washer cares too much for the souls he is addressing to compromise their eternal safety. If you\u2019re content to think that you\u2019re saved just because you \u2018asked Jesus into your heart\u2019 one time; and you don\u2019t want your faith to be tried and proved, whether it is actually of God or not; then don\u2019t bother listening to this message!  But I pray that you will listen to it, both for your own eternal safety, and for the pleasure and glory of God.   (68 minutes)",

Some of the earliest hymns in the Church were chants or Scriptural truths read aloud in unison. To verbally proclaim in unison holy truths of God will have a great affect spiritually on the Assembly of believers to strengthen and unify them in the faith once delivered to the saints.1148\r\nWe are commended in the Scriptures to verbally proclaim our allegiance to the Son of God, confessing truths that we believe in our heart.1149 Though modern day evangelicalism is mostly non-liturgical this was not so in the early days of Christianity.",

Ask for your heart to be broken for the lost. Ask for the strength to take up your cross and follow Jesus. We are to seek first His kingdom.

This holiness and glory must be manifested in your life, whether you're a child, teenager, parent or grandparent. If you as a pastor or father in the house wants godly authority over your congregation or children you must have intimate fellowship with God, daily. Abraham had the most intimate relationship with God; and God testified of him that He knew him. A congregation reveals what a pastor is like and children reveal what the parents are like. If you have truly met with God, your one desire will be God's will, and you will live for Him, regardless of your circumstances. Paul was persecuting the church, when the Lord met him on the road to Damascus. His life was changed forever. Within three days he was filled with God's Spirit.",

The Bible says to keep asking and we will receive. But what are we asking for? This message makes an appeal to us to put away childish prayers that are self-focused and begin to ask for the power and provision we need to minister to fallen humanity. Ask God for a heart for this world and an awareness of how much He loves people. Those who are looking away from self and are given for the work of God will be given supernatural strength in the coming storm!",

            "description": "This message was preached Friday April 21, 2006 in the open air on York and King, and is a warning against three types of people. The clip is about 14 minutes long and contains a lot of heckling and street preaching clashes, making this file an intense audio to hear. The point is: Jesus Christ is the narrow gate by which all men must enter. \"Enter ye in at the strait gate: for wide is the gate, and broad is the way, that leadeth to destruction, and many there be which go in thereat: Because strait is the gate, and narrow is the way, which leadeth unto life, and few there be that find it.\" (Matthew 7:13-14)",
