Just recently I had that experience again.  I met some saints\u00e2\u20ac\u201dnot anybody that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s here; now, don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t feel bad; I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m not pointing right at you, see: somebody else\u00e2\u20ac\u201dbut saints.  I was praying for the sick, and talking faith, and praying faith, and God was there.  And these saints talked unbelief. You\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d be surprised how much unbelief is hanging on us.  The Bible talks about \u00e2\u20ac\u0153the sin that doth so easily beset us.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d  It sticks to us.  Die klebt uns an.  Grad wie die Kletten; das ist Unglaube.  It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s unbelief.  And you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d be surprised what mountains of unbelief there are in the saints.  You don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t find it out until the cat bites them, or a dog barks at them, or something else happens and they really have to believe God.  Why, then their faith is gone\u00e2\u20ac\u201dabsolutely gone.",

The children of Israel were constantly afraid because they knew that their disobedience and often times unbelief, made them unclean.  Today we have become desensitized while watching television, listening to the radio, movies, and the Internet.  We no longer weep over the state of our world and there is, or most certainly should be, that fear when one truly comes into the presence of God.",

It is also a very difficult passage, e.g. where Jesus said that if you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re married and you look at another woman with lust you have already committed adultery (Matt 5:28). He also said that if you get angry with your brother and you call him a fool or other names, then you deserve hell, because before God you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve murdered him (Matt 5:22). It would be good to read this again and again because the Lord expects us to live accordingly. He also said that if someone forces you to walk a kilometre with him, then walk two (Matt 5:41). If someone strikes you on the one cheek, turn the other also (Matt 5:39). Read it prayerfully and ask yourself what kind of a life you live.",
