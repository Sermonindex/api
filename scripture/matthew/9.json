I believe it to be preached in the 60's and the recording was taken from a Record LP so there will be some background noise of the record due to quality. In this message Wilkerson deals with the problem of our minds and allowing them to entertain sinful thoughts. This is a very practical message preached to youth but is very much needed to be heard by many in our day. This message will help people who have any sinful thought life that needs to be sanctified and cleansed by the blood of Jesus Christ.",
