Ed Miller concludes this series with a look at spiritual warfare and the remnant's responsibility to be a unifying influence in the Body of Christ.  God's victory through the 300 was not for them alone but for others, such as the legalist, the self-seeking, the carnal and the rest, for the glory of God is where the people are.",
