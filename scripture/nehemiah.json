            "description": "After Daniels great intercession for the nation of Israel the angel Gabriel appears to him and tells him that he is about to be shown a great prophecy.  This is amazingly characteristic of the abundance with which the Lord gives to His people, Daniel has been asking the Lord to show mercy to the nation of Israel yet the Lord does that and more, He answers Daniel's prayer but goes so much further.  Gabriel reveals to Daniel that there will be a period of 490 years that will concern the Jews and particularly the city of Jerusalem.  The prophecy began to be fulfilled in 445BC at the decree of Cyrus to rebuild the city of Jerusalem.  483 Jewish years (360 days) later was the exact that the Lord Jesus rode into Jerusalem on the donkey, but as predicted the Messiah was executed and the temple destoyed.  So we await the fulfillment of Daniels 70th week, when the Antichrist will confirm a covenant with the jews, his people destroyed the temple and Jerusalem before he even came to the world, many believe he will probably be European.",

People are seeking places where smooth messages are being preached. Christians no longer want to hear about God's coming wrath and the necessary correction of their lives. This broken and God-fearing man denounces the passivity of God's people. Christians are blind to the lukewarmness and the sinful mixture that has crept in little by little. He warns how the spirit of blindness is the least recognizable thing. He calls believers to leave their passivity: \"You have lost your fight. That's all the devil wants to do is get the fight out of you and kill it. So you won't labor in prayer anymore, you won't weep before God anymore. You can sit and watch television and your family goes to hell. If you are expecting somebody else to win your family or to do this work you are mistaken.\" Through this very deep, challenging and anointed message, God calls believers to a baptism of anguish and to fervently pray for the recovery of a nation.",

The first thing we do is apply the truth of God's Word to every area of our life where we are not in agreement with Him. Secondly, we must remove the rubble in our homes that has blocked the door to the prayer closet. Lastly, call our children by example into the work of God.

Nehemiah had a cushy job in Persia. His position meant that the King's life was in His hands and he was also an advisor to him. Yet, his concern was for the condition of God's work in Jerusalem. As distant as he was Nehemiah still felt godly zeal for the Lord and His people. We find that he was able to inspire the Lord's people to work so zealously that they completed the rebuilding of the walls in 52 days - humanly impossible but with God, all things are possible. They both defended God's work and built, at the same time, despite all opposition.",

Pastor Legge shows that in all revivals there are 2 key elements: 1) Straight preaching ot the Word of God, 2) Obedience from the people of God.  He shows that during revival we can see 5 five key stages, the first is that the people in the revival read they're Bibles avidly, second they understand what the Word of God is saying to them, third they obey the commandments of the Lord, fourth lost truths are recovered and obeyed both in form and principle.  Finally the people of God will rediscover strength and endurance for the work of God because 'the joy that is the Lord's is their strength.'\r\n\r\n[i]All material by Pastor Legge is copyrighted.

At the time when certain of the Jews returned with Nehemiah to Jerusalem, many of them were in very straitened circumstances; and, contrary to the Jewish law, the richer Jews lent them money upon usurious interest, amounting to the hundredth per month, or twelve per cent. per annum. They took from their poorer brethren their lands, or put a heavy mortgage upon them; and in some cases took the men themselves to be slaves for debts which they had unavoidably incurred.
