He closes with sober call to those who have left the work of God in compromise to let God 'restore the year of the locust'.",

We are inclined to slip out of the place that God has ordained for us and live out our own plans. But as we surrender to His call and we begin to understand that divine life is flowing through you and you know you are exactly where you are supposed to be \u2013 you cant go no more than six paces before you stop and give God a shout of glory.",
