Parents are responsible for what comes into their homes. Watchmen and guards must be appointed and we must all fast and pray for our homes and families. Pastor Wilkerson uses Nehemiah as an example of a caring watchman who was burdened for Israel when they were rebuilding the walls of the broken down city of Jerusalem.",
