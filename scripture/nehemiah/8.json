Pastor Legge shows that in all revivals there are 2 key elements: 1) Straight preaching ot the Word of God, 2) Obedience from the people of God.  He shows that during revival we can see 5 five key stages, the first is that the people in the revival read they're Bibles avidly, second they understand what the Word of God is saying to them, third they obey the commandments of the Lord, fourth lost truths are recovered and obeyed both in form and principle.  Finally the people of God will rediscover strength and endurance for the work of God because 'the joy that is the Lord's is their strength.'\r\n\r\n[i]All material by Pastor Legge is copyrighted.
