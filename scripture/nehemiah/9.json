            "description": "Pastor Wilkerson goes through several chapters and verses in the book of Judges showing how Israel repeatedly turned from God, which gave the enemy opportunity to oppress them, and yet, when they cried out to God, he did not rail on them, he sent them a deliverer. God was angry at their sin, yet\u00a0when they cried out he delivered. He wanted them to see they needed him. If you are struggling with a besetting sin, this message will show you the way to deliverance!",
