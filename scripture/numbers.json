Once in the beginning of the wandering of the children of Israel in the wilderness and once before they came into the Promised Land. Less people came out of the wilderness then came into it. Of the various tribes there were chief men, and Moses and Aaron took these men. They were chiefs because they were expressed by their names. Elezer means my God is a rock, v6 at peace with God, a diviner, v8 a gift of God, v9 my God is father, my God has heard, v10 my God is a rewarder, v12 brother of help, v13 event of God, v14 God addeth, etc.. these names were of the chiefs or leaders of the various tribes. Then all the tribes are numbered, all twelve tribes. They would see the cloud and would be reminded of the centrality of the people, how important that a nation is to have God as its centrality. When people lose this centrality then that nation is in decline. America was founded on God and the founding fathers were bringing a recognition of the need of God. In God we trust is even on the coins for America, which has become somewhat of a hypocrisy.",

In asmuich as God is in control of the circumstances of our live but if we complain against the circumstances then we are actually complaining against God Himself. All things work together to the good of those who are called by God and according to His purposes. We are to be thankful in all circumstances. So if I start to murmur and complain then I am murming and complaining against the Lord. God continually forgives his people because He is loving and is longsuffering. God\u2019s patience and longsuffering are shown through Gods dealings with the nation of Israel. God is about to wipe out Israel and start a new nation, but because of Moses pleadings He didn\u2019t do it. God is immutable which means that he does not change. Behold I am the Lord God that changeth not. This planet is in rebellion to God but God wants to bless this planet and bring it back into harmony with Him. Through those life\u2019s that God touches He wants through us to touch others life\u2019s. Then God shows us His will and purpose so that we can share in His heart for the lost.",

There are people who are chronically complaining and there are people that are chronically complaining. But Gods will is for us to be thankful in all things. Manna was angels food \u201che fed them with angels food\u201d it is a great provision of the Lord. And God in judgment because of their complaining send fiery serpents to kill the people. There was a confession and repentance of the sin by the people. Moses pray for us and ask God to help us was the plea of the people. God told Moses to get a serpent and put it on the brass pole. So that if anyone looked to the snake on the pole and they would be healed and not die. And it\u2019s the same with the gospel that if people just look upon the cross of Christ believing then they would be saved. The brass is always a symbol of judgment and the serpent was always a symbol of sin. People afterwards took the brass serpent and began to worship it instead of the living God. People seek after idols that remind people of Gods presence that indicates that we have lost His actual presence. So this speaks of spiritual degradation. Hezekiah broke it to pieces and said it was a piece of brass. It is sad when people start to worship a church instead of the living God the church represents.",

SPURGEON, AT THE MUSIC HALL, ROYAL SURREY GARDENS. \u201cAnd the Lord said unto Moses, Make thee a fiery serpent, and set it upon a pole: and it shall come to pass that every one that is bitten, when he looketh upon it, shall live.\u201d \u2014 Numbers 21:8. I DO not propose this morning to explain again the mystery of the brazen serpent. As many of you well remember, not long ago I preached upon that subject, and endeavored to expound it in all its lengths and breadths. I have a somewhat similar object at the present time, the details may indeed be different, but after all the moral will be the same. Man has very many wants, and he should be grateful whenever the least of them is supplied. But he has one want which overtops every other: it is the want of bread. Give him raiment, house him well, decorate and adorn him, yet if you give him not bread, his body faints, he dies of hunger. Hence it is that while the earth when it is tilled is made to bring forth many things that minister unto the comfort and luxury of men, yet man is wise enough to understand that since bread is his chief want, he must be most careful concerning corn. He therefore sows broad acres with it, and he cultivates more of this, which is the grandest necessary, than he doth of anything else in his husbandry. I feel that this is the only excuse I can offer you for coming back again constantly...",

Many times we form in our mind a perceived deficiency toward that person based on our own opinion. How can we say Jesus is Lord and not acknowledge His authority.",

The heart of Christ is to minister to and serve others, and he wants us to share his heart. The devil is trying to destroy the Body, going after the weak and the young. We are to watch for our brothers and sisters, and if we see them in a battle, we must be willing to fight for them. To go into the secret closet and war against this thing on their behalf, to love not just in word, but in deed. Selfishness has disastrous consequences. Take heed.",
