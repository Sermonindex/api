            "description": "The people spoke against God and Moses and complained of why they got took out of Egypt. There are people who are chronically complaining and there are people that are chronically complaining. But Gods will is for us to be thankful in all things. Manna was angels food \u201che fed them with angels food\u201d it is a great provision of the Lord. And God in judgment because of their complaining send fiery serpents to kill the people. There was a confession and repentance of the sin by the people. Moses pray for us and ask God to help us was the plea of the people. God told Moses to get a serpent and put it on the brass pole. So that if anyone looked to the snake on the pole and they would be healed and not die. And it\u2019s the same with the gospel that if people just look upon the cross of Christ believing then they would be saved. The brass is always a symbol of judgment and the serpent was always a symbol of sin. People afterwards took the brass serpent and began to worship it instead of the living God. People seek after idols that remind people of Gods presence that indicates that we have lost His actual presence. So this speaks of spiritual degradation. Hezekiah broke it to pieces and said it was a piece of brass. It is sad when people start to worship a church instead of the living God the church represents.",

            "description": "MAN'S RUIN AND GOD'S REMEDY. DELIVERED ON SABBATH MORNING, NOVEMBER 20TH, 1859, BY THE REV. C. H. SPURGEON, AT THE MUSIC HALL, ROYAL SURREY GARDENS. \u201cAnd the Lord said unto Moses, Make thee a fiery serpent, and set it upon a pole: and it shall come to pass that every one that is bitten, when he looketh upon it, shall live.\u201d \u2014 Numbers 21:8. I DO not propose this morning to explain again the mystery of the brazen serpent. As many of you well remember, not long ago I preached upon that subject, and endeavored to expound it in all its lengths and breadths. I have a somewhat similar object at the present time, the details may indeed be different, but after all the moral will be the same. Man has very many wants, and he should be grateful whenever the least of them is supplied. But he has one want which overtops every other: it is the want of bread. Give him raiment, house him well, decorate and adorn him, yet if you give him not bread, his body faints, he dies of hunger. Hence it is that while the earth when it is tilled is made to bring forth many things that minister unto the comfort and luxury of men, yet man is wise enough to understand that since bread is his chief want, he must be most careful concerning corn. He therefore sows broad acres with it, and he cultivates more of this, which is the grandest necessary, than he doth of anything else in his husbandry. I feel that this is the only excuse I can offer you for coming back again constantly...",
