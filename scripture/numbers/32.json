            "description": "March 16, 2008 - The whole moral law calls us to be separate from the thinking of the world. If you settle in a certain comfort zone and begin to focus on self, to the exclusion of those who haven't come into your inheritance, this is the sin that WILL find you out. We can be sure that there will be a great personal cost to those who pursue self interest while there are others who still don't know the Lord. We are not called to live for ourselves. We are called to follow our Savior.",

            "description": "Be ready to write down the many other scriptures Pastor Conlon goes through in this message about what it really means to be part of the Body of Christ, and follow the example of Christ, denying ourselves and taking up our cross. The heart of Christ is to minister to and serve others, and he wants us to share his heart. The devil is trying to destroy the Body, going after the weak and the young. We are to watch for our brothers and sisters, and if we see them in a battle, we must be willing to fight for them. To go into the secret closet and war against this thing on their behalf, to love not just in word, but in deed. Selfishness has disastrous consequences. Take heed.",
