            "description": "Much can be said about this. Look at God\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s care. God gave a cloud for shade. At night there was a fire to warm them. God was there to help them. In Ps 37:23 we read that the steps of a man are established by God when God delights in his way. You go where God goes and when he stands you stand. No matter whether in bright sunlight or at night, keep your eyes fixed on God. Pierre, may your family know that you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t do anything unless God tells you to. This will turn your life into heaven or it will turn your life into hell if you don't do it. Nobody is too old or too young. We don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have a cloud or a fire that leads us anymore. We don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have the glory that they saw but we have something better, and that is the glory and beauty of the Lord Jesus. May He always be before your eyes. May your eyes be fixed on Jesus alone. If He is in you, the glory of that fire will be in you. God covered them and kept them and lead them. Can you think of anything better? God covers you. You\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve got Jesus to cover you and His fire is there for everyone to see.",
