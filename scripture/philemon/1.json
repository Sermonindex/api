            "description": "Dear brothers and sisters we are writing these practical guidelines on how to gather as a fellowship under the Headship of Jesus Christ not as rules but rather helpful ways forward for some. Any 2-3 brothers or sisters can meet in this way and start to allow the Lord to mature their gathering. We must have the simplicity of faith that our Gathering is unto Him and not for ourselves. Early Christians met together with a great joy at times because they were gathering with others who have been redeemed by the precious blood of Jesus Christ. So Jesus Christ Himself was the center of their unity. These simple guidelines combine many of the Principles found in the Principles for the Gathering of Believers volume.",

And I'm going to write a letter to Philemon and I want you to take it to him. Don't plead anything for yourself, just hand him the letter in which he will learn that I'm willing to settle everything in a righteous way.'... \"When the Lord Jesus Christ became my surety . . . he went to Calvary's cross, and all my guilt was charged against Him. He settled for everything, and then He cried, 'It is finished.' And on the basis of that finished work, God can freely forgive, and justify completely, every poor sinner who trusts in the Lord Jesus Christ.\"",

Do we have those same apostolic priorities in our relating to brothers and sisters in Christ's body?",
