You know, that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the mark of true Christian.  He examines himself in the presence of God and he judges no man.  Jesus was like that.

Christians in North Korea do not pursue the open sharing of the Gospel as it leads to immediate incarceration, beatings, torture and possible martyrdom. There are two added factors that cause Christians to act in secrecy. They do not mind to lose their own lives but if they are discovered in their faith they will give a death sentence to three generations of their families\u00e2\u20ac\u201dtheir fathers and mothers, their grandparents, their uncles and aunts and their children.",

So he allowed me to if I would take care of his chickens.  Well, they were all dead by the time he came back two week later.

Observe that this is not Paul's prayer as an unconverted man, that he may know Christ, and so be saved; for it follows upon the previous supplication that he might win Christ and be found in him. This is the desire of one who has been saved, who enjoys the full conviction that his sins are pardoned, and that he is in Christ. It is only the regenerated and saved man who can feel the desire, \u201cThat I may know him.\u201d Are you astonished that a saved man should have such a desire as this? A moment's reflection will remove your astonishment. Imagine for a moment that you are living in the age of the Roman emperors. You have been captured by Roman soldiers and dragged from your native country; you have been sold for a slave, stripped, whipped, branded, imprisoned, and treated with shameful cruelty. At last yon are appointed to die in the amphitheatre, to make holiday for a tyrant. The populace assemble with delight. There they are, tens of thousands of them, gazing down from the living sides of the capacious Colosseum. You stand alone, and naked, armed only with a single dagger-a poor defense against gigantic beasts. A ponderous door is...",

To those who love God, all things work together for good. We don't know what the future holds, but we know Him who holds the future. When Jesus departed, His disciples were sorrowful. Jesus said to them, 'It is expedient for you that I go, for when I depart, the Comforter will come - the Holy Spirit'. In verse 2 we read, \"Fulfill my joy by being like-minded, having the same love, being of one accord, of one mind\". God's people can live in this world of sin and in the devil's domain, being 'likeminded, having the same love, being of one accord, of one mind.' It is a foretaste of heaven, when God's people dwell together in such unity. Such a life is completely dedicated to God. That life and Spirit which was in Christ Jesus must also be in you.",

He shows that many Christians are sadly choosing the 'bad' without any conviction from God, in the grossest of sins becoming one with the world. \"you cannot play with the world and not be contaminated\". Much of Christians are in the bracket of 'good' but this sermon will lead you unto the 'best' and to desire after these things.",

We are to have the same mind and disposition of the Lord Jesus. The Lord Jesus had the capacity or mind to let go. This was the opposite of Satan whose character was one of possessiveness and unlawful ambition. The Lord Jesus emptied Himself and through His cross destroyed the work of the devil. To have the mind of Christ means that we know how to let go of even our own rights. This is the principle of the cross. The climax of the risen life is the cross. The way of victory is through seeing the Lord Jesus, who is greater than all. There is gain out of loss and life out of death.",

We must distinguish between the salvation we already have in possession and the consummation of salvation towards which we are progressing; it is a distortion of the gospel of grace to suppose that we are inactive in the pursuit of holiness; we can become heretical not only by denying a truth, but by putting a truth out of focus; our working in sanctification is not suspended by God's working, for these two are not incompatible; our working is wholly dependent on God's working in us, and our working manifests that God is working in us; that God is working in us is the incentive and encouragement for us to work; the very willing by the human heart to do good proceeds entirely from the grace or energy provided by God; our actions in obedience to God's Word are pleasing to God, because the force to do these works proceeds from him; all self-confidence and self-congratulation in doing God's will is excluded.",
