So he allowed me to if I would take care of his chickens.  Well, they were all dead by the time he came back two week later.

In verse 2 we read, \"Fulfill my joy by being like-minded, having the same love, being of one accord, of one mind\". God's people can live in this world of sin and in the devil's domain, being 'likeminded, having the same love, being of one accord, of one mind.'

This was the opposite of Satan whose character was one of possessiveness and unlawful ambition. The Lord Jesus emptied Himself and through His cross destroyed the work of the devil. To have the mind of Christ means that we know how to let go of even our own rights. This is the principle of the cross. The climax of the risen life is the cross.
