You know, that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the mark of true Christian.  He examines himself in the presence of God and he judges no man.  Jesus was like that.  But it would be good, and it is good, and it must be good for us to examine ourselves, or to let God examine us.  \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Examine yourselves, whether ye be in the faith, whether Christ be in you.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve been sitting here praying for this one thing: that God might help in these days for us to see our great need.

As long as we try to fix up the old, we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll only make an awful job out of it.  But, oh, if Jesus Christ has His way, he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll go His way\u00e2\u20ac\u201dwe will go His way.  And His way is just one way: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Learn of Me.

To those who love God, all things work together for good. We don't know what the future holds, but we know Him who holds the future. When Jesus departed, His disciples were sorrowful. Jesus said to them, 'It is expedient for you that I go, for when I depart, the Comforter will come - the Holy Spirit'. In verse 2 we read, \"Fulfill my joy by being like-minded, having the same love, being of one accord, of one mind\". God's people can live in this world of sin and in the devil's domain, being 'likeminded, having the same love, being of one accord, of one mind.' It is a foretaste of heaven, when God's people dwell together in such unity. Such a life is completely dedicated to God. That life and Spirit which was in Christ Jesus must also be in you.",

We are to have the same mind and disposition of the Lord Jesus. The Lord Jesus had the capacity or mind to let go. This was the opposite of Satan whose character was one of possessiveness and unlawful ambition. The Lord Jesus emptied Himself and through His cross destroyed the work of the devil. To have the mind of Christ means that we know how to let go of even our own rights. This is the principle of the cross. The climax of the risen life is the cross. The way of victory is through seeing the Lord Jesus, who is greater than all. There is gain out of loss and life out of death.",

Jesus made a covenant with the father to lay down His glory and become a man to minister and not to be ministered to, and as a humble servant to all. A person who has this mind makes like Christ to lay down their own will and to delight to do the will of the father.",

Keep in mind, the Lord is calling us for radical commitment. There is a hindrance in us that keeps us from following God\u00e2\u20ac\u201dthat is we put our trust and hope merely in man, not Christ. Man will in some way disappoint us, but the Lord never will. We need to put our all in the One who is trustworthy and will never leave nor forsake us.",

            "description": "How can we be saved by grace alone if we are commanded to work at our salvation? We must distinguish between the salvation we already have in possession and the consummation of salvation towards which we are progressing; it is a distortion of the gospel of grace to suppose that we are inactive in the pursuit of holiness; we can become heretical not only by denying a truth, but by putting a truth out of focus; our working in sanctification is not suspended by God's working, for these two are not incompatible; our working is wholly dependent on God's working in us, and our working manifests that God is working in us; that God is working in us is the incentive and encouragement for us to work; the very willing by the human heart to do good proceeds entirely from the grace or energy provided by God; our actions in obedience to God's Word are pleasing to God, because the force to do these works proceeds from him; all self-confidence and self-congratulation in doing God's will is excluded.",
