I came to Christ at a Billy Graham Los Angeles Crusade in the 1960's. While completing my Bachelor of Science degree in Business Administration at Cal Poly Pomona, I sensed the call of God on my life to follow Jesus Christ completely and possibly forget business and prepare for the ministry.. Soon after that I met Alan Redpath who invited me and my wife Jean to England, where we attended Capernwray Bible School. Upon returning to the United States, I continued my studies at Talbot Seminary in La Mirada, California.\r\nEarly in my ministry, I served for four years as an assistant pastor to Chuck Smith at Calvary Chapel of Costa Mesa, California. Next Jean and I moved to Lake Arrowhead where we planted and pastored Calvary Chapel of Lake Arrowhead. During those years I founded Calvary Chapel Bible College in nearby Twin Peaks at the Calvary Chapel Conference Center (The college is now located in Murrieta Hot Springs). Sensing the Lord's direction to move on, we then pioneered and pastored another Calvary Chapel in Redlands, California, for eleven years. In 1991, we again, still having that pioneering heart, moved to San Jose with the heart to plant a number of churches in the Bay Area. There are now eight fellowships that have grown out of Calvary Chapel of San Jose. In September 2002, we responded to a request from Chuck Smith to return to Calvary Chapel of Costa Mesa to serve as an assistant. And, in 2004 we took to the leadership of Calvary Chapel of Laguna Beach to help guide it through a difficult time. That work being completed, we have now responded to a long time desire to step out and serve the churches and schools and missionaries that we love so much around the world. Which brings us now to Calvary Way Ministries.",

His appeal and influence transcended denominational lines, and he spoke to many different groups of people.\r\n\r\nThroughout his ministry, Vance Havner lived and preached that a Christian should should exhibit faithfulness to Jesus in all areas of life.  He taught that the Christian should attend to, \"the outliving of the inliving Christ.\"  Havner wrote, \"To some, Christianity is an argument.  To many, it is a performance.

We are to have the same mind and disposition of the Lord Jesus. The Lord Jesus had the capacity or mind to let go. This was the opposite of Satan whose character was one of possessiveness and unlawful ambition. The Lord Jesus emptied Himself and through His cross destroyed the work of the devil. To have the mind of Christ means that we know how to let go of even our own rights. This is the principle of the cross. The climax of the risen life is the cross.
