Observe that this is not Paul's prayer as an unconverted man, that he may know Christ, and so be saved; for it follows upon the previous supplication that he might win Christ and be found in him. This is the desire of one who has been saved, who enjoys the full conviction that his sins are pardoned, and that he is in Christ.

Much of Christians are in the bracket of 'good' but this sermon will lead you unto the 'best' and to desire after these things.",

We are to have the same mind and disposition of the Lord Jesus. The Lord Jesus had the capacity or mind to let go. This was the opposite of Satan whose character was one of possessiveness and unlawful ambition. The Lord Jesus emptied Himself and through His cross destroyed the work of the devil. To have the mind of Christ means that we know how to let go of even our own rights. This is the principle of the cross. The climax of the risen life is the cross. The way of victory is through seeing the Lord Jesus, who is greater than all. There is gain out of loss and life out of death.",
