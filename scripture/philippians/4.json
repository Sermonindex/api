            "description": "Anxiety is reacting to something in life with fear because you feel out of control. Dr. Stanley cites Philippians 4:6-7 to show that anxiety is unnecessary if you put your trust in God in times of trouble and cry out for His help. By focusing on God, Dr. Stanley says, troubles just seem to disintegrate and there is an awesome sense of peace when you trust God to be in control of the situation.",

When I was a beginner in the ministry, before I came to Brooklyn, I used to try to get a week now, or two weeks then, to wait upon the Lord.  And one time, I found out that a brother-in-law of mine and his family were going away on a vacation, and so I asked him whether I couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be in his house for those two weeks.  So he allowed me to if I would take care of his chickens.  Well, they were all dead by the time he came back two week later.  And his little girl said to me, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153You died them, didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t you?\u00e2\u20ac\u009d  Well, no.  They died by themselves.

The conclusion to feeling better is to bless others and take our minds off of ourselves. Open up your life and be a blessing to others. As God directs our hearts we will be surprised how He uses it. Start thinking of how we can bless others. Make a list of names with all the people you have difficulty with and ask yourself, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153is there any good about them?\u00e2\u20ac\u009d Allow the Holy Spirit to work in you, and bless them.",

When God speaks a word to you don't consult with your flesh and don't allow your feelings of unworthiness to effect your prayers. We are to come boldly with a fixed position, believing the truth and power of His Word. We do not try to persuade God, but rather are fully persuaded with a fixed position to the faithfulness of His Word.",
