Dr. Stanley cites Philippians 4:6-7 to show that anxiety is unnecessary if you put your trust in God in times of trouble and cry out for His help. By focusing on God, Dr. Stanley says, troubles just seem to disintegrate and there is an awesome sense of peace when you trust God to be in control of the situation.",

When I was a beginner in the ministry, before I came to Brooklyn, I used to try to get a week now, or two weeks then, to wait upon the Lord.  And one time, I found out that a brother-in-law of mine and his family were going away on a vacation, and so I asked him whether I couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be in his house for those two weeks.  So he allowed me to if I would take care of his chickens.  Well, they were all dead by the time he came back two week later.  And his little girl said to me, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153You died them, didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t you?\u00e2\u20ac\u009d  Well, no.  They died by themselves.

Start thinking of how we can bless others.

Yohannan, the Metropolitan Bishop of Believers Church, was born and brought up in Niranam, Kerala. Niranam has immense historical significance in the tradition of Saint Thomas, a disciple of Jesus Christ who planted the first church there in AD 52.  K.P. Yohannan dedicated his life to God at a young age to serve the needy and downtrodden. He prayed, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Oh my Lord, let my heart break with the things that break Your heart\u00e2\u20ac\u009d and his life was never the same. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s his belief that one can only demonstrate God\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s love by loving people. After over four decades of selfless service, he says, I have no regrets in praying that prayer for I know God has touched millions through what He did in and through me. It is all God\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s grace.\r\n\r\nHe spent the early years of his service in North India and traveled to the remote villages sharing the love of Christ and doing charitable works. Through numerous encounters during those years, he was instilled with an increasing passion to bring hope, peace, and comfort to the needy and deprived. His sacrificial commitment, farsightedness and aptitude to perceive helped him to lead a life of unhindered devotion to serve Christ and His church. K.P. Yohannan is also the voice of Athmeeya Yathra, touching millions through his daily radio and TV broadcasts. His 250 books offer practical and spiritual guidance on hundreds of subjects.",
