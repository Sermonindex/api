            "description": "\u201cLet thine eyes look right on, and let thine eyelids look straight before thee.\u201d Proverbs 4:25. THESE words occur in a passage wherein the wise man exhorts us to take care of all parts of our nature, which he indicates by members of the body. \u201cKeep thy heart,\u201d says he, \u201cwith all diligence; for out of it are the issues of life. Put away from thee a froward mouth, and perverse lips put far from thee. Let thine eyes look right on, and let thine eyelids look straight before thee. Ponder the path of thy feet, and let all thy ways be established. Turn not to the right hand nor to the left: remove thy foot from evil.\u201d It is clear that every part of our nature needs to be carefully watched, lest in any way it should become the cause of sin. Any one member or faculty is readily able to defile all the rest, and therefore every part must be guarded with care. We have selected for our meditation the verse which deals with the eye. These windows of light need to be watched in their incomings, lest that which we take into our soul should be darkness rather than light; and they need to be watched in their outgoings, lest the glances of the eye should be full of iniquity, or should suggest foolish thoughts. Hence the wise man advises, \u201cLet thine eyes look right on, and let thine eyelids look straight before thee.\u201d",

            "description": "How does a just and holy God forgive sin? For sin is an abomination to the Lord and His very nature demands justice be served. Come and rejoice in a loving Saviour who was willing to drink the cup of God's wrath in our place and be crushed for our transgressions. Learn how only God's perfect Son could satisfy the Father's need for justice. A most powerful and enlightening sermon.",

For many of us having mercy or asking: Am I correct in feeling this way? can become an afterthought. Scripture reminds us to examine ourselves first. Judging, criticizing, maligning character, slandering and speaking to tear down another is probably one of the easiest things to do. Sadly, in the Christianity of our day such unedifying practices are applauded as righteous and discerning. Tearing down has become a ministry preoccupation with many in the blogosphere and Internet in general.",

He says there are only two ways to live, two ways that you can approach any decision or action \u2013 either in the flesh or in the spirit. If you don\u2019t live after the Spirit, you are still under condemnation. He discusses the difference between \u201cthe pursuit of happiness\u201d and \u201cthe pursuit of righteousness.\u201d He says the key to \"living in the Spirit\" can be found in Proverbs 3:5-6, \u201cIn all your ways acknowledge Him\u2026\u201d Dr. Thompson finishes by discussing some \"big picture\" elements, such as, why God created man as a response to the rebellion of the angels.

Bill shares precious testimonies of committing loved ones to the Lord and then trusting God to do it, even though nothing perceivable is happening.  One testimony was about his own mother who committed her husband and four sons to the Lord and waited 14 years for the first one to come to Christ; all did come eventually.  \"Don't try to figure out what God is doing,\" he reassures.",

He took them into Himself. Even God turned away from Him and Jesus cried out, \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcMy God, My God, why hast Thou forsaken Me?\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 (Matt 27:46). Sin is terrible, and God Who is absolutely holy has no fellowship with sin. He speaks very harsh words regarding sin, like, \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcthe wages of sin is death\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 (Rom 6:23). If you do not part from your sins, you will die. Peter writes that the one who has confessed his sins and goes back again is like a dog that vomits and eats it again (2Pet 2:22). The Bible says that a person who repents and goes back to his sin, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s better that he never repented (2Pet 2:20-21; Heb 6:4-6).

The question we ask is, \"Do you trust in the midst of the storm?\" We must be gripped with the knowledge that God is in TOTAL CONTROL of everything that is going on around us. In times of calamity it is our human tendency to focus on ourselves and withdraw our hand from the needy around us. As children of God we are admonished not to withdraw our hands in self preservation, but rather to stretch out our hand to the poor and needy. There is power in our hand to do good because Christ's hands stretch forth through us to offer comfort and consolation to those who don't know Him!",

            "description": "A SERMON DELIVERED ON SUNDAY MORNING,\r\nMAY 12TH, 1861, BY REV. C. H. SPURGEON, AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON. \u201cHe that handleth a matter wisely shall find good: and whoso trusteth in the Lord, happy is he.\u201d \u2014 Proverbs 16:20. WISDOM is man's true path \u2014 that which enables him to accomplish best the end of his being, and which, therefore, gives to him the richest enjoyment, and the fullest play for all his powers. Wisdom is the compass by which man is to steer across the trackless waste of life. Without wisdom man is as the wild asses' colt; he runs hither and thither, wasting strength which might be profitably employed. Without wisdom, man may be compared to a soil untilled, which may yield some fair flowers, but can never field a harvest which shall repay the labor of the reaper, or even the toil of the gleaner. Give man wisdom, wisdom in the true sense of the term, and he rises to all the dignity that manhood can possibly know; he becomes a fit companion for the angels, and between him and God there is no creature; he standeth next to the Eternal One, because Christ has espoused his nature, and so has linked humanity with divinity. But where shall this wisdom be found? Many have dreamed that they discovered it, but they have not possessed it. Where shall we find it? \u2018Twere worth while to pierce the bowels of the earth, to scale the heights of heaven, to traverse the deserts, to plough the sea, to fly through the illimitable fields of ether ...",

Was a preacher born in Bangor, County Down, Ireland. Nicknamed \"the Tornado of the Pulpit\", Nicholson spent his early years on his father's cargo ship. He began to preach Christianity in 1899 at the age of 23 and was known for his \"men-only\" meetings. Nicholson used straightforward language which communicated to the common man.\r\n\"Nicholson used to say that when a mission was begun it was not long before they had either a riot or revival. Sometimes we had more riot than revival, but never a revival without a riot.\" Nicholson wielded the Sword of the Spirit with a fury. His hearers were always affected one way or another. Some through his preaching were brought to humble repentance, while others resisted God's Word with indignation. Two favorite themes of Nicholson were \"God's love\" and \"God's hell.\" W. P. Nicholson always preached the love of God with all the warmth and tenderness he could muster; but for those who rejected this Good News, he offered the only alternative, GOD'S HELL. He preached on every aspect of hell with such zeal and passion that his hearers claimed to be able to almost smell the burning sulphur. Still others, under deep conviction and anxiety, dripped with sweat and unconsciously shredded the hymn books they held in their laps. Through this kind of fervent preaching, God brought entire communities face to face with the question, \"What shall I do with Jesus?\" One elderly man who had recollections of the Ulster Revival of 1859 said that some of the effects of Nicholson's meetings even exceeded what happened in '59. Another commentator on Nicholson's work said that he had seen nothing like it since the days of D. L. Moody.",

The heart includes feelings, love and desire etc.  People put fences around their livestock.  In the same way, we need to put boundaries around our feelings and desires.
