His eschatological insight is a very needful truth to be realized in the body of Christ. \r\n\r\nArt was a prophetic voice insofar as he called his listeners to purposes in God that would affect both time and eternity, purposes that had to do with the glory of God in the Church.

Was a preacher born in Bangor, County Down, Ireland. Nicknamed \"the Tornado of the Pulpit\", Nicholson spent his early years on his father's cargo ship. He began to preach Christianity in 1899 at the age of 23 and was known for his \"men-only\" meetings. Nicholson used straightforward language which communicated to the common man.\r\n\"Nicholson used to say that when a mission was begun it was not long before they had either a riot or revival. Sometimes we had more riot than revival, but never a revival without a riot.\" Nicholson wielded the Sword of the Spirit with a fury. His hearers were always affected one way or another. Some through his preaching were brought to humble repentance, while others resisted God's Word with indignation. Two favorite themes of Nicholson were \"God's love\" and \"God's hell.\" W. P. Nicholson always preached the love of God with all the warmth and tenderness he could muster; but for those who rejected this Good News, he offered the only alternative, GOD'S HELL. He preached on every aspect of hell with such zeal and passion that his hearers claimed to be able to almost smell the burning sulphur. Still others, under deep conviction and anxiety, dripped with sweat and unconsciously shredded the hymn books they held in their laps. Through this kind of fervent preaching, God brought entire communities face to face with the question, \"What shall I do with Jesus?\" One elderly man who had recollections of the Ulster Revival of 1859 said that some of the effects of Nicholson's meetings even exceeded what happened in '59. Another commentator on Nicholson's work said that he had seen nothing like it since the days of D. L. Moody.",
