            "description": "January 27, 2008 - It is time for the Church of Jesus Christ to bring honor to His name by manifesting the law of kindness. We, as a church, are called into moral and spiritual excellence through which God is glorified. The law of kindness radiates through the mouth of those who are one in heart and mind with Jesus and whose deep desire is to live a life that is conformed to the cross of Christ. When we speak with the law of kindness we take our Savior and put Him in the gates in a place of honor. Kind speech puts a crown of glory on Jesus and those around us have to take notice. What does your speech reveal to those around you?",

            "description": "When someone lies, we do not take it seriously, but God's Word says that lying lips are an abomination to the Lord. But the one who speaks truthfully is a joy to the Lord. That is why we must live truthfully at all times, to bring joy to the Most High. When Cain killed his brother, God asked him about his brother, but he answered that he was not his brother's keeper. Deception has many varieties. Lies have many shades of colour. Sometimes lies can be taken so lightly that the liar laughs afterwards about the deception.",
