Brother Beasley was a powerful preacher of the Word of God who ministered mostly in southern Baptist churches in America. The Lord gave him a gift of faith to trust the Lord in impossible circumstances for God's glory. Even though Manley Beasley was not very old as we measure a life's span, he left behind a legacy of faith that was rarely seen in his generation. We pray that he will be honored and the Lord glorified by this attempt to share this legacy with all who would live a life of faith that is truly pleasing to God.\r\nThere came a time when Manley believed the Lord gave him a choice of complete healing or daily healing. Manley chose daily healing because for him it was an act of faith that each day the Lord had to heal him to the point that he could get out of bed. During those years there were more confinements in the hospital, as well as trips to Europe and revivals all over the United States. He led Bible Conferences, revivals, and shared his personal testimony with others dealing with illness.",

As a nation we have in large scale rejected the true and living God and have abandoned our godly heritage and the special light that came through mighty preachers in the past and formerly pious church denominations and have gone headlong into decadent humanism, deceptive liberalism, demonic occultism and a weak, man-centered, flesh-pleasing, fad-conforming evangelicalism. By doing so we have incurred a dreadful accountability as a nation before God. As a nation we must repent and plead for God to have mercy upon us.",

Sadly these days, our Nation is marked not only by an unrestrained and unashamed abandonment to sensuality but also by the putrid sin of sexual perversion. What is called sexual orientation and an alternative lifestyle today, God has always called an abomination, which he visits with severe judgment but from which he offers salvation.  In this message from God's Word to our Nation, we hear God's rebuke and denunciation for our nation's aggravated moral sins and a call to repentance and prayer. There is cleansing in the blood of Christ for all of our sexual sins. 1 Corinthians 6:9-11",
