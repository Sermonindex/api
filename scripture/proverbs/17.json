            "description": "Kenaston passionately speaks of several recent examples of many generation families who have done great exploits for the kingdom of God.  He sites William and Catherine Booth's eight children and 45 children on fire for God as one such role model, as well as Hudson Taylor's and Jonathan Edwards'.  He closes by sharing how greatly influenced he was by a Canadian family 22 years prior whose family life and influence in the community burned a new vision in his heart and altered his course forever.",

Come and rejoice in a loving Saviour who was willing to drink the cup of God's wrath in our place and be crushed for our transgressions. Learn how only God's perfect Son could satisfy the Father's need for justice. A most powerful and enlightening sermon.",

            "description": "Using the scripture passage above, supported by a wide selection of other Bible verses, Paul Washer gives a powerful exposition of the cross of Christ. He explains our sin, God\u2019s justice, and how sinners can be justified. He reveals what was in the cup that Christ drank, and why God forsook him on the cross. Do you want to know how much God hates sin? Mr Washer asks; then look what God did to his own beloved Son. (74 minutes).",
