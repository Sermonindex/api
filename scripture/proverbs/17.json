He sites William and Catherine Booth's eight children and 45 children on fire for God as one such role model, as well as Hudson Taylor's and Jonathan Edwards'.  He closes by sharing how greatly influenced he was by a Canadian family 22 years prior whose family life and influence in the community burned a new vision in his heart and altered his course forever.",

Come and rejoice in a loving Saviour who was willing to drink the cup of God's wrath in our place and be crushed for our transgressions.
