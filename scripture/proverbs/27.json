            "description": "In this age of technology when we get hurt it is easy to go to Facebook, or other social media to voice our feelings. For many of us having mercy or asking: Am I correct in feeling this way? can become an afterthought. Scripture reminds us to examine ourselves first. Judging, criticizing, maligning character, slandering and speaking to tear down another is probably one of the easiest things to do. Sadly, in the Christianity of our day such unedifying practices are applauded as righteous and discerning. Tearing down has become a ministry preoccupation with many in the blogosphere and Internet in general.",

Going to church on Sunday's and maybe on Wednesday's doesn't mean you are in church or evening having fellowship. It is silly to say that we are going to church...when we are the church. What kind of fellowship can you have in church? Usually we are sitting in pews for an hour, shake some hands in between breaks and then when it is over you go home or maybe even out to lunch!?",
