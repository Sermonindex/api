He was born in Newtownards, County Down, Ireland in 1911. In his book Tramp after God, he tells of living for more than three years as a tramp abusing alcohol and involved in crime. Willie Mullan had a religious conversion and from that time forward he decided he would strive to serve God.\r\n\r\n In 1953 Willie Mullan was called to Lurgan Baptist church, and in August of that year he commenced the work in Lurgan. One of his great accomplishments during this time was the Tuesday night Bible class. Every Tuesday night hundreds attended to hear the exposition of the Word. In 1957 William Hewitt and a team of helpers commenced the tape recordings of the Bible class. At least 1500 of these recordings remain until this day.",

If you don\u2019t live after the Spirit, you are still under condemnation. He discusses the difference between \u201cthe pursuit of happiness\u201d and \u201cthe pursuit of righteousness.\u201d He says the key to \"living in the Spirit\" can be found in Proverbs 3:5-6, \u201cIn all your ways acknowledge Him\u2026\u201d Dr. Thompson finishes by discussing some \"big picture\" elements, such as, why God created man as a response to the rebellion of the angels.

He encourages believers to entrust their loved ones to His care and to lay down the worries and fears of praying for the unsaved. Find rest in trusting your unsaved friends and family to an all powerful and loving God. Do you know the difference between praying and committing to God?  Bill shares precious testimonies of committing loved ones to the Lord and then trusting God to do it, even though nothing perceivable is happening.  One testimony was about his own mother who committed her husband and four sons to the Lord and waited 14 years for the first one to come to Christ; all did come eventually.  \"Don't try to figure out what God is doing,\" he reassures.",

On, October 17, 1971, God in His sovereignty came in revival.

The question we ask is, \"Do you trust in the midst of the storm?\" We must be gripped with the knowledge that God is in TOTAL CONTROL of everything that is going on around us. In times of calamity it is our human tendency to focus on ourselves and withdraw our hand from the needy around us. As children of God we are admonished not to withdraw our hands in self preservation, but rather to stretch out our hand to the poor and needy. There is power in our hand to do good because Christ's hands stretch forth through us to offer comfort and consolation to those who don't know Him!",
