He shares how powerful an influence a hidden woman has on the life of her husband, motivating and energizing him to fulfill God's calling on his life.  He then speaks on the power of a submissive spirit and how getting outside of God's creative purpose is likened to a fish out of water.",

            "description": "January 27, 2008 - It is time for the Church of Jesus Christ to bring honor to His name by manifesting the law of kindness. We, as a church, are called into moral and spiritual excellence through which God is glorified. The law of kindness radiates through the mouth of those who are one in heart and mind with Jesus and whose deep desire is to live a life that is conformed to the cross of Christ. When we speak with the law of kindness we take our Savior and put Him in the gates in a place of honor. Kind speech puts a crown of glory on Jesus and those around us have to take notice. What does your speech reveal to those around you?",
