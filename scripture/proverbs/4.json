            "description": "\u201cLet thine eyes look right on, and let thine eyelids look straight before thee.\u201d Proverbs 4:25. THESE words occur in a passage wherein the wise man exhorts us to take care of all parts of our nature, which he indicates by members of the body. \u201cKeep thy heart,\u201d says he, \u201cwith all diligence; for out of it are the issues of life. Put away from thee a froward mouth, and perverse lips put far from thee. Let thine eyes look right on, and let thine eyelids look straight before thee. Ponder the path of thy feet, and let all thy ways be established. Turn not to the right hand nor to the left: remove thy foot from evil.\u201d It is clear that every part of our nature needs to be carefully watched, lest in any way it should become the cause of sin. Any one member or faculty is readily able to defile all the rest, and therefore every part must be guarded with care. We have selected for our meditation the verse which deals with the eye. These windows of light need to be watched in their incomings, lest that which we take into our soul should be darkness rather than light; and they need to be watched in their outgoings, lest the glances of the eye should be full of iniquity, or should suggest foolish thoughts. Hence the wise man advises, \u201cLet thine eyes look right on, and let thine eyelids look straight before thee.\u201d",

Building on the foundational principle of Godly character and example, he gives practical explanations of what it means to not provoke to anger; to instruct and train; to discipline and encourage; and to recognise a child\u2019s God-given abilities. Fathers must invest in their children, he exhorts;  \u201cDon\u2019t give them things, give them you\u201d. (49 minutes)",

            "description": "Why is it that people forsake the way of God?  They don't keep His word in their hearts and Satan deceives them.  If God speaks to you, write it down for this is life to a man's whole body.  It is wonderful if a person loves God.  Lukewarm Christians are a nuisance in the Church.  God's words are life and many die because they do not pay attention to God's word.  This is something that we must do continually.  The heart includes feelings, love and desire etc.  People put fences around their livestock.  In the same way, we need to put boundaries around our feelings and desires.  You can't go after everything your eyes sees.  Like Job, you have to make a covenant with your eyes and keep your eyes fixed on the goal or by sunset of the same day, you will already be derailed spiritually.  You'll mess around with young children if you do not guard your heart.",
