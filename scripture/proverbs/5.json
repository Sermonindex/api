Brother Denny also shares from the first marriage in the Garden of Eden why both physical and emotional virginity are so vital to safeguard, as well as some practical advice to some \"touchy issues\" such as sensuous clothes, flirting and \"the dating game\".",

God speaks an uncompromisingly strong, life-saving call to hold on for the final result of sin is personal destruction and ruin, which singles out the individual personally and reminds them that they must cling to Jesus or fall away.",

Michael Brown gives a blunt and convicting message, encouraging the listeners to search their hearts and repent.",
