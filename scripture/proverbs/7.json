            "description": "Its one thing to tell people about God its another thing to be a living witness of His truth. Truth is an effective witness when our speech and actions are one. Truth has a confidence in God that believes He is in control and He works all circumstances for our good. When Truth stands before the unsaved and God begins to reveal Himself through our lives, the truth that is in us will force a man to search his heart. The man or woman that is a witness to truth shows a dying world that there us a Living God that bears witness to Himself through our lives.",
