Tozer intimates, \u201cMy friend, the wisest man in the world is the man who knows the most about God.\u201d Only as things are seen from the sanctuary may they truly be seen in focus. Through 1 Peter 2:17 and a loving exegesis of Psalm 104, Pastor Tozer illuminates two of \u201cthe five things the Christian should do if he is to grow in grace and in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ:\u201d 1) Venerate all things; 2) Honor all men; 3) Love all Christians; 4) Fear God; 5) Honor the authorities. \u201cVenerate All God\u2019s Creation\u201d is the 24th message in a 34-part study of Peter\u2019s first epistle. Recorded on March 14, 1954, in Chicago, Illinois, the sermon is 40 minutes and 34 seconds in length.",

When your spiritual output exceeds your intake. (You need daily time alone seeking God.) 3. When you study of God's Word is done exclusive to the application. (Do you articulate better than you live it?). 4. When you allow the spirit of the world to invade your life and home. (This world will be dim in a heart that is hungry for God.). 5.

His eschatological insight is a very needful truth to be realized in the body of Christ. \r\n\r\nArt was a prophetic voice insofar as he called his listeners to purposes in God that would affect both time and eternity, purposes that had to do with the glory of God in the Church.   Frequently, his messages called the Church to an awareness of the Last Days [End-times] in such a way that made that time seem imminent and at the door.",

Though it is a good spiritual principle to compare spiritual truths with spiritual truths,1139 yet this must all be done in the larger context of God\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Word.

Many hymns and choruses that could be sung by memory and without instruments have been laid aside for more contemporary songs that have much musical accompaniment. The argument is not over styles of music or what is permissible in a worship setting but rather that a very powerful weapon of the Church has been lost. This occurs when we do not have many hymns and choruses that we can sing without instruments with a whole heart towards the Lord. Thus the burden here is to simply supply a resource of many old hymns, choruses and spiritual songs for reading, meditation and singing privately and corporately.",

Jackie gives a short, deep and challenging call to go and minister to the poor with a broken heart. Her message is followed by personal testimonies. The recording ends in weeping over the hardness of our hearts and for the poor. Real ministry is to show people the Lord of the Word: \"They will know what He is like by what you are like. So you live it with your life and they will read you like an epistle.\" Whenever the destitute cry out, God will respond by sending a person, and it could be you. God works through people. Jackie also points out that the poor don't need training in evangelism, as evangelism is simply \"one poor man telling another poor man where to find bread\".",

            "description": "Paul Washer begins this exposition of Matthew 5:5 by explaining that \u2018The Beatitudes\u2019 (verses 3-11) do not just speak of what it is to live a blessed life, but they speak of conformity to the image of Christ, for they are a great description of Jesus Christ as he walked on this earth. Many preachers say little more about meekness than showing that is not weakness; but what does the word really mean? The true meaning of any word is defined not merely through a dictionary, but by studying the context of the passage(s) where it occurs; so, using the obvious parallels between Matthew 5:5 and Psalm 37:11, Mr Washer uses the context of Psalm 37:1-11 to define the word \u2018meek\u2019. He works through the verses one by one, revealing the character of the meek man: he does not fret, nor envy the wicked; he trusts in God and dwells in the land; he delights himself in the Lord, commits his way unto the Lord, rests in the Lord, and so on. \u201cThis is what it means to be meek\u201d, says Mr Washer, \u201cand it is one of our greatest needs today\u201d.

The salvation business is a friend of happiness. Making heaven on earth is our business. Serve the Lord with gladness is one of our favorite mottos. So I am pleased that you are pleased! But amidst all your joys don't forget the sons and daughters of misery. Do you ever visit them?  Come away and let us make a call or two. Here is a home, six in family, they eat and drink and sleep and sick and die in the same chamber. Here is a drunkard hovel, void of furniture, wife a skeleton, children in rags; father now sleeping, the victims of his neglect. Here are the unemployed, wandering about, seeking work and finding none. Yonder are the wretched criminals cradled in crime passing in and out of the prisons all the time. There are the Daughter of shame deceived and wronged and ruined.  Traveling down the dark and blind to an early grave. There are the children, fighting in the gutter, going hungry to school. Growing up to fill their parents places.  Brought it all on themselves, you say?  Perhaps so.  But that does not excuse our assisting them. You don?t demand a certificate of virtue before you drag some drowning creature out of the water.  Nor the assurance in a man of faded grace before you deliver him from the burning building.  But what shall we do?  Content ourselves by singing a hymn? Offering a prayer? Or giving a little good advice?  NO!  Ten thousand times no!  We will forgive them.  Feed them! Reclaim them.  Employ them!Perhaps we shall fail with many.   Quite likely.  But our business is to help them all the same.  And that in the most practical, economical and Christlike manner.  So let us hasten to the rescue for the sake of our own peace, the poor wretches themselves, ____ (dean?) of these children, and the danger(Savior?) of us all.  But you must help with the means.  And there is nothing like the present.  Who in this company will lend a hand by taking up the gauntlet?",

Was a British Methodist preacher who founded The Salvation Army and became its first General (1878\u20131912). The Christian movement with a quasi-military structure and government founded in 1865 has spread from London, England to many parts of the world and is known for being one of the largest distributors of humanitarian aid. Though Booth became a prominent Methodist evangelist, he was unhappy that the annual conference of the denomination kept assigning him to a pastorate, the duties of which he had to neglect to respond to the frequent requests that he do evangelistic campaigns. At the Liverpool conference in 1861, after having spent three years at Gateshead, his request to be freed for evangelism full-time was refused yet again, and Booth resigned from the ministry of the Methodist New Connexion.\r\n\r\nThe name The Salvation Army developed from an incident in May 1878. William Booth was dictating a letter to his secretary George Scott Railton and said, \"We are a volunteer army.\" Bramwell Booth heard his father and said, \"Volunteer, I'm no volunteer, I'm a regular!\" Railton was instructed to cross out the word \"volunteer\" and substitute the word \"salvation\". The Salvation Army was modelled after the military, with its own flag (or colours) and its own music, often with Christian words to popular and folkloric tunes sung in the pubs. Booth and the other soldiers in \"God's Army\" would wear the Army's own uniform, 'putting on the armour,' for meetings and ministry work. He became the \"General\" and his other ministers were given appropriate ranks as \"officers\". Other members became \"soldiers\".",

There are seasons in our life when God will allow forms of sorrow into our heart for His own purpose. Sometimes God will allow times of isolation so we can stop and think about His ways in order to get an eternal perspective. If you are feeling alone this message reminds us that it was the shepherds that were isolated out in the field who got the revelation of Jesus. It was Simeon a lonely man who waited for the comfort of Christ. And it was Anna, a widow who was no stranger to sorrow. Has it ever occurred to you that isolation and loneliness might be mandatory for us to see Christ in the midst of crisis. In the last days it talks about a bride filled with oil who will see Him in calamity. Those who have suffered will be filled with oil so they see the nearness of Christ and His power.

Many turn back right at the place where they will begin to discover and enter into the supernatural life of God. When we are in unbelief we begin to limit God by doubting that He could supply what we need and take us where He is calling us to go. The central core of unbelief is that God's way is incomplete and we must help Him bring His plan to pass. If you are sitting in unbelief, remove yourself from that place and grab on to the promises of God. We must learn how to trust God for strength and provision. Don't pray to get out of the situation, pray that you may find supernatural life in it. God is looking for people who have come through the wilderness with a voice of triumph to speak to the next generation. Do you believe that God CAN, or will you limit the Holy One of Israel?",

The Social Gospel (all the teaching and example of Christ is not enough to save the soul and sin is not in the fact that Judas did not follow protocol but that his heart was not right) 3.

Edwards \"is widely acknowledged to be America's most important and original philosophical theologian,\" and one of America's greatest intellectuals. Edwards's theological work is broad in scope, but he was rooted in Reformed theology, the metaphysics of theological determinism, and the Puritan heritage. Recent studies have emphasized how thoroughly Edwards grounded his life's work on conceptions of beauty, harmony, and ethical fittingness, and how central The Enlightenment was to his mindset. Edwards played a critical role in shaping the First Great Awakening, and oversaw some of the first revivals in 1733\u201335 at his church in Northampton, Massachusetts.\r\n\r\nEdwards delivered the sermon \"Sinners in the Hands of an Angry God\", a classic of early American literature, during another revival in 1741, following George Whitefield's tour of the Thirteen Colonies. Edwards is well known for his many books, The End For Which God Created the World, The Life of David Brainerd, which served to inspire thousands of missionaries throughout the 19th century, and Religious Affections, which many Reformed Evangelicals still read today.",

Manley chose daily healing because for him it was an act of faith that each day the Lord had to heal him to the point that he could get out of bed. During those years there were more confinements in the hospital, as well as trips to Europe and revivals all over the United States.

He began a worldwide indigenous church-planting movement in India that eventually saw more than 10,000 local churches. Norman Grubb missionary statesman, author and teacher: \"In all my missionary experience I think these churches on their New Testament foundations are the nearest I have seen to a replica of the early church and a pattern for the birth and growth of the young churches in all the countries which we used to talk about as mission fields.\"\r\nLife of prayer. Brother Bakht Singh was a man of prayer. He spent hours upon his knees in communion with the Lord seeking the Lord's mind regarding His will concerning the work and ministry.

Yet he stayed true to God's call on his life prayed and pleading for true heaven sent revival. \r\n\r\n\"Those who know of Leonard Ravenhill recognize in him the religious specialist, the man sent from God to battle the priests of Baal on their own mountain top, to shame the careless priest at the altar, to face the false prophet, and to warn the people who are being led astray by him. \" - Tozer | \"Leonard Ravenhill was one of the few men I have ever known who was a true prophet.\" - David Wilkerson",

Use my life to bring healing and freedom to those who are lost.\u201d What will revival look like? All people with a no name ministry will suddenly show up with the glory of God on them. Grandmothers who laid hold of the Cross will begin to speak to a younger generation. Young people like David in the Bible who will not cower under the pressure of this society will rise up with a cry that says, \"is there not a cause?\" There is coming a season when God will turn the people\u2019s hearts back to Him and He will pour out His Spirit on all flesh.",

God used him to have a powerful prophetic insight into the end-times and the coming suffering of the jewish people before the great accepting of Jesus as Messiah. His eschatological insight is a very needful truth to be realized in the body of Christ. \r\n\r\nArt was a prophetic voice insofar as he called his listeners to purposes in God that would affect both time and eternity, purposes that had to do with the glory of God in the Church.   Frequently, his messages called the Church to an awareness of the Last Days [End-times] in such a way that made that time seem imminent and at the door.",

Many of us come to Christ and we want to drink from the cup of salvation, future authority, present power and healing but we don\u2019t want to go the distance and drink the cup of suffering and affliction. If we are going to put the cup to our mouth we must come to the place where we cry like Jesus \"NOT MY WILL BUT THINE BE DONE\". This is a place where the only strength we have is to lift up the cup and call on the name of Jesus. In these times of darkness don't cast away your confidence in God because there is a great reward for those who drink this cup in faith and trust.",

Niranam has immense historical significance in the tradition of Saint Thomas, a disciple of Jesus Christ who planted the first church there in AD 52.  K.P. Yohannan dedicated his life to God at a young age to serve the needy and downtrodden. He prayed, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Oh my Lord, let my heart break with the things that break Your heart\u00e2\u20ac\u009d and his life was never the same. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s his belief that one can only demonstrate God\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s love by loving people. After over four decades of selfless service, he says, I have no regrets in praying that prayer for I know God has touched millions through what He did in and through me. It is all God\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s grace.\r\n\r\nHe spent the early years of his service in North India and traveled to the remote villages sharing the love of Christ and doing charitable works. Through numerous encounters during those years, he was instilled with an increasing passion to bring hope, peace, and comfort to the needy and deprived. His sacrificial commitment, farsightedness and aptitude to perceive helped him to lead a life of unhindered devotion to serve Christ and His church. K.P. Yohannan is also the voice of Athmeeya Yathra, touching millions through his daily radio and TV broadcasts. His 250 books offer practical and spiritual guidance on hundreds of subjects.",

We can wake up having a testimony of a fixed heart and singing a song of victory instead of waking up singing a song of our circumstances and having a testimony of the troubles around us.

This is one of the best illustrations of the Lord Jesus Christ-it's not so much a sermon as a verbal portrait painted with love and care of our Lord that every Christian needs to hear. It will change how you deal with others and it will forever change how you see the Lord if you listen with an open and hungry heart. He goes through many Scriptures, so I'd recommend having a pencil and paper on hand.",
