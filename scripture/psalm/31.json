In this time of trial the devil will come at you with the lie that your life has no purpose. Don\u2019t give in to the voice of the enemy, because you have the power of God in you, and you don\u2019t have to believe those lies. Jesus Christ went through everything you are going through and His voice is the only voice that counts. God will never allow your enemies to triumph over you. Sometimes it is as simple as hearing a Word from God. There is a point when God quiets every voice and calls you to be silent before Him so He can calm the storm. When God speaks you will have peace in your inner man. You will hear Him say, \u201cPeace be still!\u201d Keep silent before Him and let Him renew your strength.",
