            "description": "Millions of Christians don't enjoy the blessing of knowing there is no sin imputed to them and no sins on the books waiting against them on judgment. When they fail, they fall into despair and fear, because of a thundering conscience over the law. It always thunders wrath against an individual who sins. A seared conscience will excuse you, but a sincere Christian will hear the condemning thunder of their conscience. But when Jesus went to the cross, the very first drop of blood, out of Calvary, took away the dominion of the conscience to condemn. An addition to the 8 part series Bro. Wilkerson taught \"Hallowed be thy Names.\"",
