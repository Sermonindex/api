He is often regarded as one of the most well-known bible teachers and preachers and pioneers of the Indian Church movements.

He began a worldwide indigenous church-planting movement in India that eventually saw more than 10,000 local churches. Norman Grubb missionary statesman, author and teacher: \"In all my missionary experience I think these churches on their New Testament foundations are the nearest I have seen to a replica of the early church and a pattern for the birth and growth of the young churches in all the countries which we used to talk about as mission fields.\"\r\nLife of prayer. Brother Bakht Singh was a man of prayer. He spent hours upon his knees in communion with the Lord seeking the Lord's mind regarding His will concerning the work and ministry. Therefore, the Lord also honored him and blessed him beyond any human understanding.

Brother Zac contrasts these two streams--religiosity vs. spirituality--as it threads its way through the Bible, starting with Cain and Abel, to the Pharisees and Jesus, to the end times in Revelation with Babylon and Jerusalem.  Externally these can appear so similar, but the underlying spirit is as different as heaven is from hell.",
