            "description": "July 30, 2006 \u2013 We are living in a time when superficial joy will dissipate. Christians who have a wrong focus on Jesus will never experience true joy. God has a prescribed order in the way we should seek Him and serve Him. Our seeking God has to be divinely lead and divinely influenced. When we begin to abide in Christ our lives will be put in divine order. The joy comes when we find the abiding life of Christ flowing in us and through us.",
