            "description": "We need ever keep before us that we exist for the glory of God. He chose us in Christ and predestined us \u201caccording to the good pleasure of His will, to the praise of the glory of His grace, wherein He hath made us accepted in the Beloved.\u201d Man is a fallen creature, spiritually leprous, ignorant, and blind, but ever subject to the Most High. While man will want to remonstrate against such an assertion, it is still true. Every created thing comes under the holy and sovereign jurisdiction of \u2018The Most High God\u2019. That right He never foregoes. He is going to call all beings to account to Him. This challenging message brings out the ways in which this can be practically achieved by us.",

David rouses himself in respect of every faculty of his God-touched and God-illumined being to be in the employ of worship. THIS is his delight. He stirs himself up so that all the powers of his soul, and every talent he was endowed with, was used to set forth God\u2019s praises. His soul cannot be dormant, inactive, or silent. As in all true spiritual awakenings, it is not possible to feel God at work in your own heart and see Him at work in the Church, without it radically affecting your entire devotional life and your spiritual worship.",

We are greatly helped to note how David addressed God in the midst of trials of his faith. The triumph of his trust is most conspicuous, such confidence in God as yields praiseful worship in the strangest place.",
