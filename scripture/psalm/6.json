            "description": "There are many reasons Christians do not pray as they should, and this is one of the gentlest rebukes Pastor Wilkerson has given on this subject. He lovingly explains about the warfare we have to fight our way through to pray, and reveals even if we have neglected to pray as we should, God still wants us to come to him, and he will by the Holy Ghost teach us how to pray as we should. For that alone is how we learn. So stop beating yourself up and get alone with the Holy Spirit and ask him to teach you to pray.",
