Johnston lives in Memphis, Tennessee and is a fellow of the Stephen Olford Institute for Biblical Preaching. He is currently involved in Bible teaching and disciple making, as well as authoring books. Some of his titles include: Realities of Revival (series), Church in Revival (series), Call to Revival (series), Return to Me, No Turning Back, The Master\u2019s Plan, Walking with God, etc.\r\n\"If the Church will not defend His holy Name then the Almighty must. God will either pour out His blessings in revival to defend His holy Name, or He will pour out His wrath upon mankind to avenge His holy Name. It will either be a defending or avenging to show forth His glory and remind mankind He alone is the Sovereign ruler of all.\"",
