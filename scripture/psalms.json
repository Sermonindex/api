            "description": "David, still on the run from Saul, heads to the Philistines to take refuge, and ends up in Gath the hometown of Goliath!  This was a very strange thing for David to do as he has also killed thousands of Philistines, as well as Goliath.  So David is captured by them and imprisoned.  David knowing he has done wrong does the right thing and cries out to God, this is when he wrote Psalm 56 and it can be seen in this Psalm how David's heart is turned back to the Lord as he cries out for mercy.  He is then brought before Achish the king, David pretends to be mad which must have taken great humility to act that way before his enemies so Achish releases David and on his way from Gath David praises the Lord mightily, Psalm 34.  The Lord showed His love to David even though David did not deserve it, which shows the great love and mercy of God.  David then heads for the cave of Adullam from which you can see the valley where David slew Goliath and David lamented and wrote Palm 142.",

David was oppressed in the heart of his trial so the Lord sent Jonathan to him to strenthen him. Jonathan remind David of the Lord's promises to him how David will be king of Israel and that even Saul knows this, but Jonathan goes to far in what he is saying to David and says that he will be next to David when he is king, this sadly wouldn't come to pass as Jonathan would be killed in battle beofre David even came to the throne.  When Jonathan leaves David the Ziphites go and betray David into the hand of Saul, it was then that David wrote Psalm 54 and as seen in the psalm David puts his whole trust in the Lord and his heart is filled with praise to God.  Sauls army is just about to encircle David when a messanger comes to Saul and informs him that the philistines are invading and the Israel is under attack so Saul has to leave off from David and defend Israel.",

Solomon said in Ecclesiastes chapter 3 and verse 4: 'There is a time to weep, and there is a time to laugh; there is a time to mourn, and there is a time to dance'. In some quarters of the church there is a great emphasis today on laughing and on dancing. Today it seems that the church, God's people, sleep instead of weep. They are merry instead of mourning. I do not believe that the church today, especially in the West, is living in a day of laughter and in a day of rejoicing. They might feel themselves to be, they might have been spellbound like those in Galatians chapter 3, where Paul could say to them: 'Who hath bewitched you', who has cast this spell, hypnotised you into believing something as it is not? I believe that, for the child of God today, our day should be a day of weeping and a day of mourning. I believe that it is a time to cry.\r\n\r\n[i]All material by Pastor Legge is copyrighted.

He knows has an internant ministry across the world you can access messages and request him as a speaker at the Preach The Word website.\r\n\"Like Israel, who are a type, I believe, in many respects of God's people today: we have been transferred from bondage, the kingdom of darkness, the kingdom of Satan, and we have been placed into the kingdom of light, the kingdom of God's dear Son... and yet many believing New Testament Christians never cross the Jordan. They settle for less than God intended for them. I have to say that there can even be resentment, or resistance, shown toward anyone who will try to get God's people over the Jordan and into their inheritance.\" - David Legge",

Grace is being presented, he says, as an excuse to live however we want, yet still receive eternal life and blessing from God. He asserts that, as Psalm 18 says, God will reward us according to our righteousness. Rather than grace being an excuse for unrighteous behavior, it is the very power and ability to live righteously.",

'As we have heard, so have we seen': this is seldom true. In many places we see what we have not heard, and what we have heard we do not see. Time was when many simpletons believed that the streets of London were paved with gold. I am sure I do not know any part of London in which a single lump of that metal can be found in the footway. Ten thousand idle tales there are in every country, of mines where fortunes may be dug out of the earth, and plains where wealth forces itself on the immigrant; but how seldom do we hear the good news, 'As we have heard, so have we seen.' But when you come into the 'City of the Lord of hosts, in the city of our God,' the reports about it are true, and the truth exceeds the report; for, like the Queen of Sheba, we cry, 'The half was not told me.' When we speak of the privileges of the Church of God on earth it is impossible to exaggerate. 'Behold, what manner of love the Father hath bestowed upon us, that we should be called the sons of God.' Behold, what blessings, what riches, what royalties the Lord Jesus bestows upon his chosen! How cleansed they are by his blood! How quickened by his life! How honored by his glorious enthronement at the right hand of the Father...",

In 1510 he went to Rome, as he was disillusioned with the way the church was in Germany, there he became even more concerned and left declaring that the city was built over Hell itself! He returned to Germany where he became a Bible teacher it was here in preparing for a lesson one day that he read Psalm 31:1 and later Romans 1:17 and realised by faith man can not only be deemed 'not guilty' but actually be seen as righteous before a perfect God.",

            "description": "Dr. Thompson begins discussing the idea that we do not wrestle against flesh and blood, but against principalities, etc. He discusses the dynamics of spiritual warfare, including the concept of \u201ctwo armies\u201d \u2013 An army of warriors (angels) and an army of judges (men). The delay in Christ\u2019s return has to do with the fact that the \u201carmy of judges\u201d is not ready yet, he says. This life of trials and tests is to form Christ in us \u2013 which makes us ready to judge and rule with Him. He segues into the purpose of the blood of Christ: it forgives our sins, it cleanses sin, it covers us (for protection), it nourishes the inner man, it deadens the power of sin over you, and it will literally remove the sin from you (at His coming). The sermon is much more interesting than I\u2019m making it sound.",

Often times it may well just be one area that remains but nonetheless folks continue in that sin.  Wilkerson preaches a very personal message here and he shares his heart and shows his own weakness as an example.  The consequences for a Christian continuing in sin are sobering, but he gave us what we needed to overcome sin, if we want to. For those who are sick of their sin, and hate it, and cry out to God, there is wonderful news. He will empower you, and he wants to put his fear in your heart so you will not turn away from him, and then he can take you into the fullness of the new covenant. Powerful preaching, with a gentle compassion for those who are struggling.",

True faith in God results in an abiding peace and rest in your soul. When we haven't learned to trust God, he will bring us to a place of depth to train us to trust him no matter whats.

He deals with misconceptions of praying only for leaders and not whole congregations, pointing out from Acts how the Holy Spirit fills both individuals and entire congregations.  Guzik appeals to let go of the 'machinery' of men to earnestly seek God in prayer for 'a unique stirring of the Spirit of God' in our day!",

When he penned this psalm, the writer, David, was in deep distress, if not of circumstances, yet of conscience. He constantly mentions iniquities, and begs forgiveness. He felt like a shipwrecked mariner, carried overboard into the raging sea. Thus he reviews the situation - 'Out of the depths have I cried unto thee, O Lord.' Yet he lived to tell the tale of deliverance. His prayer from among the waves was a memory worth preserving, and he does preserve it. The mercy of God to him he weaves into a song for us; and in this our text is found. Two things the rescued sufferer tells us. First, that, as God delivered him from the power of sin, so he will deliver all his praying, wrestling, believing people. That is the last verse of the psalm - He shall redeem Israel from all his iniquities.' The argument is - He delivered me. What am I more than others? The gracious Lord who saved me will save all those who call upon him in truth. He delivered me, though laden with iniquities, and his pardoning mercy is unfailing; and therefore he can and will rescue others from their uttermost distresses.

There is a point in our lives when we have to face our fears and believe God to deliver us. God has already defeated every enemy we will ever face in Jesus Christ.

God will allow us to experience these afflictions and use them as a doorway into fellowship with Him so that we are conformable to the death of Jesus Christ. When we are betrayed it is a pain like no other. The devil will do his best to keep us behind the gates of betrayal so that we keep a distance from people and vow never to trust again. We know we are passing through these gates when we choose to forgive and begin to have a strong desire to be reconciled with our betrayer. We will come to a place of undersatnding that God has been in control all along and the life of Christ that is imparted into us through this experience will become provision for someone else.",

WE shall aim at no novelty to-night, nor shall we try to serve up the old truths in any new and attractive forms. Upon your tables you always require bread, and generally you account salt to be indispensable. Some kinds of food are presented to us over and over again, and it would augur ill for our health if they were not always relished. It was an evil lusting which made Israel tire of the manna; an Israelite in his right mind found it to be a dainty still, though he ate of it for every day of his forty years' pilgrimage. Who tires of the verdure of the fields, the light of the sun, or the air we breathe? These things are ever fresh and new, and ever needful to us. The doctrine of forgiving love is one of those necessaries of daily life, concerning which it may be affirmed that if we should set them before you every day we should not be guilty of vain repetition. None need fear of tiring man, or vexing God's Spirit by harping too much on this string. Therefore come we to our favourite theme to-night. To speak of the great gospel truth of the forgiveness of sin in the simplest manner we possibly can, is the purpose we have immediately in view...",

You, who have not believed in our Lord Jesus Christ, have no rest to which you can return, for you have never, found any. May God grant to you the grace to come unto Christ that you may find rest unto your souls! But we, who believe in him, do enter into rest. We are sometimes described as journeying through the wilderness towards Canaan, and the type is quite allowable; but, still, it must not be pressed, too far; for, in another sense, we have already entered into our rest. We have entered the Canaan which our Joshua has given unto us; Moses, by the law, could not lead us into this promised land; but Jesus has brought us into it, and we now have our portion and our inheritance in the covenant blessings which God has provided for his people in Christ Jesus his Son. God's people, when they are as they ought to be, are in a state of rest even now. I do not mean that they will have rest so far as this world is concerned, for this earth is not our rest, it is polluted; but I do mean that as the apostle Paul writes to the Romans, 'There is therefore now no condemnation to them which are, in Christ Jesus, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit.'",

Campbell shared several practical \"principles that govern spiritual quickening.\"  The differences between a God-sent revival and the man-centered evangelistic means of his day are truly heart-searching for anyone engaged in work to save men's souls.  Since God's sovereignty does not nullify man's responsibility, Campbell admonished his hearers to be \"agents of revival\" that take God up on \"His covenant engagement\" in prayer and staying close to the heart of the Shepherd.",

A stubborn person has an inner flaw and this inner flaw doesn't show until they are called to put all they are in the hands of God and walk in obedience. A stubborn person can appear humble, zealous and even excercise spiritual gifts, but there comes a certain point they can't get passed. They can't lay down their inner thoughts of the way things should be done and surrender to God's ways. God will allow a sense of emptiness come into our souls to get our attention. He is looking for a sincere heart to submit to the authority of His Word. When we choose to obey Him the power of sin and decay is cancelled in our lives. The only way out of stubbornness is to HUMBLE ourselves before God.",

These terrors were continual; they scared him at night with visions, they terrified him all day with dark and gloomy forebodings. \u201cDay and night thy hand was heavy upon me.\u201d His pain was so extreme, that when he resorted to prayer he could scarcely utter an articulate word. There were groanings that could not be uttered within his spirit; and hence he calls his prayer roaring \u2014 a \u201croaring all the day long.\u201d Wherever he was, his spirit seemed to be always sighing, sending a full torrent of melancholy groans upwards towards God; a \u201croaring all the day long.\u201d So far did this groaning proceed, that at last his bodily frame began to show evidences of it. He grew old, and that not merely in the lines of the countenance and the falling in of the cheeks, but his very bones seemed as if they partook of the suffering. He became like an old man before his time. We have heard of some who through severe trouble have had their hair blanched in a single night.",

If you are sick of your sin, and weary of it, there is hope for God will never refuse a sincere heart.

As you go through life you will meet with many difficulties where all you can do is cry to the Lord, \"please save me from this\". As you meet up with things enough to make you afraid you will need the Lord to be your fortress. And when the wicked come up against you and those that hate you oppose you, then you will need the Lord to be with you that you can overcome. The devil comes in many different ways, not only with his horns and hooves and tail, but also as an angel of light.

            "description": "A SERMON DELIVERED ON SABBATH MORNING, FEBRUARY 25, 1855, BY THE REV. C. H. SPURGEON, AT EXETER HALL, STRAND. \u201cI have exalted one chosen out of the people.\u201d \u2014 Psalm 89:19. ORIGINALLY, I have no doubt, these words referred to David... However, in this sermon we shall not speak of David, but of the Lord Jesus Christ, for David, as referred to in the text, is an eminent type of Jesus Christ, our Lord and Savior, who was chosen out of the people; and of whom his Father can say \u201cI have exalted one chosen out of the people.\u201d Before I enter into the illustration of this truth I wish to make one statement, so that all objections may be avoided as to the doctrine of my sermon. Our Savior Jesus Christ, I say, was chosen out of the people; but this merely respects his manhood. As \u201cvery God of very God\u201d he was not chosen out of the people, for there was none save him. He was his Father\u2019s only-begotten Son, \u201cbegotten of the Father before all worlds.\u201d He was God\u2019s fellow, co-equal, and co-eternal; consequently when we speak of Jesus as being chosen out of the people, we must speak of him as a man. We are, I conceive, too forgetful of the real manhood of our Redeemer, for a man he was to all intents and purposes, and I love to sing, \u201cA Man there was, a real Man Who once on Calvary died.\u201d He was not man and God amalgamated \u2014 the two natures suffered no confusion \u2014 he was very God, without the diminution of his essence or attributes...",
