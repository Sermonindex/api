            "description": "\"Now this was the sin of your sister Sodom: She and her daughters were arrogant, overfed and unconcerned; they did not help the poor and needy. They were haughty and did detestable things before me. Therefore I did away with them as you have seen\" Ezekiel 16:49. Jackie gives a short, deep and challenging call to go and minister to the poor with a broken heart. Her message is followed by personal testimonies. The recording ends in weeping over the hardness of our hearts and for the poor. Real ministry is to show people the Lord of the Word: \"They will know what He is like by what you are like. So you live it with your life and they will read you like an epistle.\" Whenever the destitute cry out, God will respond by sending a person, and it could be you. God works through people. Jackie also points out that the poor don't need training in evangelism, as evangelism is simply \"one poor man telling another poor man where to find bread\".",

Shortly after her experience of being born-again the Lord called her to take a one-way ticket to Hong Kong, China. Her story is chronicled in the book: \"Chasing the Dragon\" which is a best-seller inspirational missionary story. He has founded St Stephen's Society in Hong Kong that helps serve drug addicts and gives them the life-transforming Gospel message.\r\n\r\nHer burden in ministry has been to show the love of Christ to the hurting and helpless. She saw in the message of the Gospel it had to have a response for us also to go and serve others. She teaches and shows this full-surrender is a simple response to receiving God's love in Jesus Christ.",
