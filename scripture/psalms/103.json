And people laid hold of it all over the place.  And I think before I got through preaching, many were filled with the Holy Ghost, and many got up, one by one, and testified that they had been healed of the most unbelievable diseases.  Cancer, and other terrible things fled before the memory\u00e2\u20ac\u201dthe remembrance\u00e2\u20ac\u201d\u00e2\u20ac\u0153Forget not all His benefits.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d  Forget not all that He has done for you on Calvary\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s cross.  I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m so glad that Jesus Christ instituted this communion service for all of us.  And He told us to remember Him until He comes.  When He comes, we won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t need it anymore because then we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll have Him in person.  Then \u00e2\u20ac\u0153we shall look upon Him as He is,\u00e2\u20ac\u009d and then we shall forever be united to Him.

WE shall aim at no novelty to-night, nor shall we try to serve up the old truths in any new and attractive forms. Upon your tables you always require bread, and generally you account salt to be indispensable. Some kinds of food are presented to us over and over again, and it would augur ill for our health if they were not always relished. It was an evil lusting which made Israel tire of the manna; an Israelite in his right mind found it to be a dainty still, though he ate of it for every day of his forty years' pilgrimage. Who tires of the verdure of the fields, the light of the sun, or the air we breathe? These things are ever fresh and new, and ever needful to us. The doctrine of forgiving love is one of those necessaries of daily life, concerning which it may be affirmed that if we should set them before you every day we should not be guilty of vain repetition. None need fear of tiring man, or vexing God's Spirit by harping too much on this string. Therefore come we to our favourite theme to-night. To speak of the great gospel truth of the forgiveness of sin in the simplest manner we possibly can, is the purpose we have immediately in view...",
