In the times of great abundance, Pharaoh\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s dream instructs us to be wise to store up, whether physically or spiritually with our free time to study God's Word.  The naming of Joseph's two sons illustrates that before we can be fruitful, we must forget all the evil and mistakes of others.",

God called brother Zac Poonen to a new work early on in his Christian experience. The movement is now called Christian Fellowship Churches where the New Covenant of New Testament Christianity is clearly preached. \r\n\r\nBrother Zac Poonen has written 25 books most of them being on the deeper Christian life. Many of these have been translated into a number of languages and have been circulated widely around the world. He clearly and passionately shares the  narrow way of Christian discipleship that is neglected by so many modern preachers.",

God will allow us to experience these afflictions and use them as a doorway into fellowship with Him so that we are conformable to the death of Jesus Christ. When we are betrayed it is a pain like no other. The devil will do his best to keep us behind the gates of betrayal so that we keep a distance from people and vow never to trust again. We know we are passing through these gates when we choose to forgive and begin to have a strong desire to be reconciled with our betrayer. We will come to a place of undersatnding that God has been in control all along and the life of Christ that is imparted into us through this experience will become provision for someone else.",
