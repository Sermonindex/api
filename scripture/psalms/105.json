In the times of great abundance, Pharaoh\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s dream instructs us to be wise to store up, whether physically or spiritually with our free time to study God's Word.  The naming of Joseph's two sons illustrates that before we can be fruitful, we must forget all the evil and mistakes of others.",

            "description": "Every child of God will have to endure trials of suffering and betrayal if they will be mightily used by God. God will allow us to experience these afflictions and use them as a doorway into fellowship with Him so that we are conformable to the death of Jesus Christ. When we are betrayed it is a pain like no other. The devil will do his best to keep us behind the gates of betrayal so that we keep a distance from people and vow never to trust again. We know we are passing through these gates when we choose to forgive and begin to have a strong desire to be reconciled with our betrayer. We will come to a place of undersatnding that God has been in control all along and the life of Christ that is imparted into us through this experience will become provision for someone else.",

God wanted to feed them what would make them strong, and they wanted what would make them fat and slow. A great contrast between today's church seeking the flesh more than Spirit.",
