God's mercy reaches out to the hungry, thirsty, lonely longing soul. His mercy reaches out to the fool that says in his heart there is no God. His mercy rescues those who think commerce and money satisfy the deepest longings of their souls. When God's people fully understand the tender mercies of God we will begin to cry, \"God before your judgment comes let your mercy be known again!\" God is stirring His church to stand between the living and the dead, and ask God to one more time to honor His name and save the lost.",

If you have exhausted all your resources and are ready to give up, then you are finally at wit\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s end. Which means you are at the end . . . to end all. But what appears to be the end can actually be the beginning: the beginning of a brand new way of life. And this new life is a life of rest and peace and joy.
