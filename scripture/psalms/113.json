            "description": "This message begins Scriptures on the holiness, power and might of God, and His requirement of worship of which He is worthy. From there, Pastor Conlon takes us on an incredible journey through the Old Testament and back to the New, illustrating through the Word the incredible humility this awesome God of unimaginable power has shown toward mankind. This is one of the best illustrations of the Lord Jesus Christ-it's not so much a sermon as a verbal portrait painted with love and care of our Lord that every Christian needs to hear. It will change how you deal with others and it will forever change how you see the Lord if you listen with an open and hungry heart. He goes through many Scriptures, so I'd recommend having a pencil and paper on hand.",
