            "description": "All through scripture, throughout the lives of various saints, the call to come up to the mountain to let him reveal his heart to you. Spiritual laziness and prayerlessness will lead to the loss of passion for Christ and the inability to feed the sheep from the treasure of the Word. We can't know the heart of God until we let God lead us to the place of crucifixion of self. Let him preserve you from selfishness, and settling for less than he has for you. We are called to overcome, to rise above the beggardly elements of this world and stand victorious.",
