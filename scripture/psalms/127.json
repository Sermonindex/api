We can see what priority our children have by the time we give them.  Do we realize we are raising sons and daughters for the King of Kings and Lord of Lords?  If so, it will change our whole life's ambition in the way we bring them up.",

Childraising is to be as purposeful as the Israelite warrior who meticulously prepared his arrows to destroy the enemy.  \"What is success,\" brother Denny asks, \"a big pile of money or a bunch of arrows in your quiver ready to go?\"",
