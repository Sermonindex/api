It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s this: that we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re learning, slowly, to abandon ourselves. Now, a person, of course, can abandon himself to sin\u00e2\u20ac\u201dto flesh, to lust, to pride, to sensitiveness, to all the works of the flesh.  But the wonderful thing is that we have learned\u00e2\u20ac\u201dor are learning\u00e2\u20ac\u201dto abandon ourselves to Jesus, or \u00e2\u20ac\u0153wholly give ourselves to One who gives Himself to us\u00e2\u20ac\u009d.",
