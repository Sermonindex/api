            "description": "December 6, 2009 - God has a desire to walk among His people and display His power. The power of life, virtue and the anointing of the almighty God is released through a people who choose to walk in unity. There is a unity that is found in the body of Christ that is not found anywhere else in the world. Unity is the gathering together in agreement with the Word and will of God. Believers walking in unity for the purpose of Christ will experience Jesus Himself walking in their midst. When God's people choose to be one with Him and one with each other He commands a blessing!",

            "description": "It is impossible for two to walk together without agreement and the oneness of the Holy Spirit.  We need leaders who are led by the Holy Spirit.  Satan will seek to destroy through envy and will use a wolf spirit to undermine authority.  The qualifications of a man, used by God, are a sense of inadequacy, weakness, poor and needy, he doesn't see himself as humble but as he really is, he has total dependence on God, there is no confidence in self, and he has total reliance on the Holy Spirit.",
