            "description": "Dr. Thompson begins discussing the idea that we do not wrestle against flesh and blood, but against principalities, etc. He discusses the dynamics of spiritual warfare, including the concept of \u201ctwo armies\u201d \u2013 An army of warriors (angels) and an army of judges (men). The delay in Christ\u2019s return has to do with the fact that the \u201carmy of judges\u201d is not ready yet, he says. This life of trials and tests is to form Christ in us \u2013 which makes us ready to judge and rule with Him. He segues into the purpose of the blood of Christ: it forgives our sins, it cleanses sin, it covers us (for protection), it nourishes the inner man, it deadens the power of sin over you, and it will literally remove the sin from you (at His coming). The sermon is much more interesting than I\u2019m making it sound.",

            "description": "This message is especially for people who are tormented by past experiences and failures.  Carter uses Mark 5, where the word speaks of the man who cuts himself, in a word picture that describes someone whose thinking can\u2019t get free from the past.  Carter also describes what Jesus has done at the cross with his death and resurrection in taking captivity captive along with Psalm 149 to describe a Christian\u2019s victory over Satan because of what Christ has done.  The sermon is titled The Written Judgment Of God because of the judgment that is written against Satan in the scriptures.  Satan no longer has the power keep a Christian in a place of defeat and cause the Christian to cut himself with thoughts because of the past.  As Jesus said, \u201cIt is finished.\u201d  These past sins have been removed as far as the East is from the West.",
