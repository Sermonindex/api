            "description": "Dr. Thompson begins discussing the idea that we do not wrestle against flesh and blood, but against principalities, etc. He discusses the dynamics of spiritual warfare, including the concept of \u201ctwo armies\u201d \u2013 An army of warriors (angels) and an army of judges (men). The delay in Christ\u2019s return has to do with the fact that the \u201carmy of judges\u201d is not ready yet, he says. This life of trials and tests is to form Christ in us \u2013 which makes us ready to judge and rule with Him. He segues into the purpose of the blood of Christ: it forgives our sins, it cleanses sin, it covers us (for protection), it nourishes the inner man, it deadens the power of sin over you, and it will literally remove the sin from you (at His coming). The sermon is much more interesting than I\u2019m making it sound.",
