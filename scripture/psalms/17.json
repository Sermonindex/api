But you know, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been a source of unceasing wonderment to me how that He always manages to come.  Praise the Lord!  Sometimes people don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t pay very much attention to Him, but He always manages to come, and He always manages to manifest Himself.  He must have a real purpose in it; He must have a real plan.  And wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t it be interesting to find out just what God\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s plan is?",
