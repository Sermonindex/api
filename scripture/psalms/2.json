Wilkerson reminds me of a grandfather that speaks sternly to his children strictly because he loves them. \"Their father knew my Father. But my Father is STRONGER than their Father!\" is a recurring statement and theme in this sermon. Preaching from Psalms 2, we learn what it is about the righteous that gets the world bunched up.  Learn where this rage comes from and why there is such a hatred for righteousness.",
