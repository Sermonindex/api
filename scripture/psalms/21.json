            "description": "It's a sad statement about affairs of the church when a crippled man lays near the gate outside the sanctuary, expecting only spare change. When you know the heart of God, why he came to die for sinners, you will boldly be able to speak the truth, with real spiritual authority into the lives of others. The world around us is lost and dying, and we as the church need to pray the power of God down into the homes and hearts of people who so desperately need God.",
