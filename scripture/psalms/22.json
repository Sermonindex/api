Only the meek and lowly can be mightily used of God, whose strength is made perfect in weakness. In the Kingdom of heaven the way up is down! \"Blessed are the meek.\" \"He who humbles himself will be exalted.\" Ravenhill recommends reading Isaiah 40 every day to keep in view the supremacy and all-sufficiency of the Lord.",

Yet he stayed true to God's call on his life prayed and pleading for true heaven sent revival. \r\n\r\n\"Those who know of Leonard Ravenhill recognize in him the religious specialist, the man sent from God to battle the priests of Baal on their own mountain top, to shame the careless priest at the altar, to face the false prophet, and to warn the people who are being led astray by him. \" - Tozer | \"Leonard Ravenhill was one of the few men I have ever known who was a true prophet.\" - David Wilkerson",

This power is found in the crucified life of Jesus Christ.  There is a beautiful analogy found in the crushing of the Scarlet Worm and the life of Christ.  Without the crushing of either one there is neither usefulness nor fulfillment.  So the Christian must follow Christ to the cross in dying to self and living the resurrected life in Christ.",

He teaches his children to trust him and serve him. He draws his children to satisfy them with himself. He opened his hand to all at the cross of Calvary, and he deals gently with his people. He is what every soul is longing for. He satisfies completely.",

Was a Christian missionary, teacher, writer, and advocate of economic development in impoverished nations. A spiritual crisis during this period\u2014as he described two decades later in what is probably his best-known recorded teaching, \"Ten Shekels and a Shirt\"--left Reidhead with the conviction that much of evangelicalism had adopted utilitarian and humanistic philosophies contradictory to Biblical teaching. The end of all being, he came to believe, was not the happiness of man, but the glorification of God. This theme would recur throughout his later teaching.\r\n\r\nSince Mr. Reidhead's death in 1992, Bible Teaching Ministries, Inc. continues under the leadership of his wife, Marjorie, and daughter, Virginia Teitt, a dedicated Board, and the many people who have donated time and talent after being changed by God\u2019s Word through this message.
