Only the meek and lowly can be mightily used of God, whose strength is made perfect in weakness. In the Kingdom of heaven the way up is down! \"Blessed are the meek.\" \"He who humbles himself will be exalted.\" Ravenhill recommends reading Isaiah 40 every day to keep in view the supremacy and all-sufficiency of the Lord.",

Because of past wounds in their lives, some fear God will reject them as people sometimes have. You can determine to live a new life in Christ, secure and have the assurance you so desperately need. When the Word comes and voices arise to condemn you, you can shoot them down (Is. 54:17). God loves you enough to not let you by with sin that will destroy you. Come to him for cleansing, forgiveness, and peace and rest.",

This power is found in the crucified life of Jesus Christ.  There is a beautiful analogy found in the crushing of the Scarlet Worm and the life of Christ.  Without the crushing of either one there is neither usefulness nor fulfillment.  So the Christian must follow Christ to the cross in dying to self and living the resurrected life in Christ.",
