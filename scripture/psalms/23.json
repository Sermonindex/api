He teaches how your home can become a \"haven of rest and refreshment\" by taking proactive leadership with your children in the good and right way.

We can only faithfully represent him when we truly know him. If you are not actively, honestly seeking God, then you need to get down to business and ask him for the desire and hunger in your heart for him. He will give it to those who are sincere. And they will reap wonderful rewards of joy and peace in their God. We need to actively seek God, wanting his ways and thoughts over our own to become so intimate with him that we know his heart and share it. Then we will love what he loves and hate what he hates. Thinking as he things, walking together in agreement. This is what God wants with each of his children. For those who want a closer walk with the Lord, this is a must hear.",

Some of the times God is doing the deepest work in our lives are the times when we are not hearing anything. These are seasons when God leads us by waters of quietness. God is building a temple where His glory will me manifested and He does it in quietness.Because we don't hear anything doesnt mean that nothing is going on.

David preaches in city-wide crusades, church-wide conventions, at Christian colleges and universities as well as at many other venues throughout the United States and overseas. In 1983, he traveled with Dr. Stephen Olford throughout the country and had ministered on platforms with him before his Homegoing in 2004 (David was blessed to have him on his Advisory Board).\r\nSpeaking from his heart, David is deeply burdened for true revival in the church and spiritual awakening in America and the world. In God's grace and goodness, many series of meetings extends well beyond scheduled dates because God sovereignly moves in precious revival. To God be the glory!

The church that forms a false image will not endure when hard times come and they will abandon the journey of Christ to follow their own agenda. God in His mercy will allow this false image to be broken in pieces so we can go back to God and do things His way. When we are left with an empty shell and a cry in our heart that says, \"God I am nothing apart from you\", God will respond by filling us with His glory. If ever there is a time to cry out for the Holy Spirit to fill us it's now!",
