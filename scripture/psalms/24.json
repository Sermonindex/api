Have you ever asked yourself, \"if God is with us why do I face such violent opposition?\" Are these obstacles and giants necessary? Obstacles and giants are placed on our path to teach us that we are not God. He is, and in and of yourself there is no strength to defeat these enemies. The Word of God promises that God Himseld will fight for us! Victory comes when we stand against these giants in the power of the Holy Spirit for the glory and honor of God's Name!",

Listen to this hour long prayer meeting as over 25 people share their hearts burden in prayer to see revival in our day.",

Often we pray a blessing over our children and relatives. Why is it that people desire the blessing but so few receive it. Those who go to the witch doctor are told if they take the potion or slaughter a cow they will receive blessing but many grow old never having received blessing. Some die not having received God\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s blessing. How then do we receive His blessing?",
