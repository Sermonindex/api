If you as a bridegroom don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have deep roots, you will be uprooted. And that applies to the bride too. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s very deep and one of the most important decisions you will ever make. In our text we read that the Lord is my light, and we need that light as well as His salvation. As you go through life you will meet with many difficulties where all you can do is cry to the Lord, \"please save me from this\". As you meet up with things enough to make you afraid you will need the Lord to be your fortress. And when the wicked come up against you and those that hate you oppose you, then you will need the Lord to be with you that you can overcome. The devil comes in many different ways, not only with his horns and hooves and tail, but also as an angel of light. David goes on to say that even if an army encamps against him he won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be afraid for he is trusting in God.",
