The face of God is His reflection and His likeness. This is a call to get to know who the Lord so we can live like Him. To seek the face of God is to receive the knowledge of who He is , how He acts towards mankind so that you can spend your time seeking Jesus in your everyday situations.",

If we are going to put the cup to our mouth we must come to the place where we cry like Jesus \"NOT MY WILL BUT THINE BE DONE\". This is a place where the only strength we have is to lift up the cup and call on the name of Jesus. In these times of darkness don't cast away your confidence in God because there is a great reward for those who drink this cup in faith and trust.",

That pertains to the experience of salvation and the promise of victory that He has promised to His people. God is the stronghold of His people because He is their strength. The intimate protection of God gives confidence and banishes fear, regardless of how great our adversaries. We look to the Lord and in His greatness our problems and adversaries become insignificant. Opposition and outright war did not touch him because his heart was strengthened by the Lord. The psalmist longs for God's temple and expresses the intensity of his seeking after God Himself. He desires to dwell in the temple of God for the rest of his life, and to gaze on the Lord's beauty. May we hold onto this word and make it our own.",

If you as a bridegroom don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have deep roots, you will be uprooted. And that applies to the bride too. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s very deep and one of the most important decisions you will ever make. In our text we read that the Lord is my light, and we need that light as well as His salvation. As you go through life you will meet with many difficulties where all you can do is cry to the Lord, \"please save me from this\". As you meet up with things enough to make you afraid you will need the Lord to be your fortress. And when the wicked come up against you and those that hate you oppose you, then you will need the Lord to be with you that you can overcome. The devil comes in many different ways, not only with his horns and hooves and tail, but also as an angel of light. David goes on to say that even if an army encamps against him he won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be afraid for he is trusting in God.",
