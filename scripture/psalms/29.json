Secondly we are unwilling to hear what the Lord wants to speak to us. When we choose to deny ourself and live to glorify God, the Lord's voice will thunder into our heart. If you choose to live for His glory, He will speak to you and take you out of the image of self and bring you into the image of Christ. No matter what situation you find yourself in today God will still speak to you. The voice of the Lord is powerful and full of majesty. In His temple everyone speaks of His Glory!",

Humans are the only thing that God created that has the ability to resist God. God is always speaking! His voice is above everything on earth. Nothing can drown out the voice of God. When God speaks He creates a pathway into His life. When we receive His Word by faith miracles happen and our lives begin to declare His glory.",
