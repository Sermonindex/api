            "description": "Martin Luther was born in Germany to a poor mining family, Luther though excelled at school and studied law at university, he was set to be one of the top legal minds in Europe.  However due to a vow to Saint Barbara, patron saint of miners, he became a monk and applied his legal mind to theology, he saw the Lord as righteous Judge of the whole creation and thus was zealous to live a holy life.  In 1510 he went to Rome, as he was disillusioned with the way the church was in Germany, there he became even more concerned and left declaring that the city was built over Hell itself! He returned to Germany where he became a Bible teacher it was here in preparing for a lesson one day that he read Psalm 31:1 and later Romans 1:17 and realised by faith man can not only be deemed 'not guilty' but actually be seen as righteous before a perfect God.",

            "description": "November 7, 2010 - Are you in a tight or distressful place? A place where you feel hemmed in? In this time of trial the devil will come at you with the lie that your life has no purpose. Don\u2019t give in to the voice of the enemy, because you have the power of God in you, and you don\u2019t have to believe those lies. Jesus Christ went through everything you are going through and His voice is the only voice that counts. God will never allow your enemies to triumph over you. Sometimes it is as simple as hearing a Word from God. There is a point when God quiets every voice and calls you to be silent before Him so He can calm the storm. When God speaks you will have peace in your inner man. You will hear Him say, \u201cPeace be still!\u201d Keep silent before Him and let Him renew your strength.",
