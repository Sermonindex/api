            "description": "Millions of Christians don't enjoy the blessing of knowing there is no sin imputed to them and no sins on the books waiting against them on judgment. When they fail, they fall into despair and fear, because of a thundering conscience over the law. It always thunders wrath against an individual who sins. A seared conscience will excuse you, but a sincere Christian will hear the condemning thunder of their conscience. But when Jesus went to the cross, the very first drop of blood, out of Calvary, took away the dominion of the conscience to condemn. An addition to the 8 part series Bro. Wilkerson taught \"Hallowed be thy Names.\"",

            "description": "May 27, 2007 - A stubborn person is a person who is fixed in purpose or condition, resistant to change and unreasonably obstinate. A stubborn person has an inner flaw and this inner flaw doesn't show until they are called to put all they are in the hands of God and walk in obedience. A stubborn person can appear humble, zealous and even excercise spiritual gifts, but there comes a certain point they can't get passed. They can't lay down their inner thoughts of the way things should be done and surrender to God's ways. God will allow a sense of emptiness come into our souls to get our attention. He is looking for a sincere heart to submit to the authority of His Word. When we choose to obey Him the power of sin and decay is cancelled in our lives. The only way out of stubbornness is to HUMBLE ourselves before God.",

These terrors were continual; they scared him at night with visions, they terrified him all day with dark and gloomy forebodings. \u201cDay and night thy hand was heavy upon me.\u201d His pain was so extreme, that when he resorted to prayer he could scarcely utter an articulate word. There were groanings that could not be uttered within his spirit; and hence he calls his prayer roaring \u2014 a \u201croaring all the day long.\u201d Wherever he was, his spirit seemed to be always sighing, sending a full torrent of melancholy groans upwards towards God; a \u201croaring all the day long.\u201d So far did this groaning proceed, that at last his bodily frame began to show evidences of it. He grew old, and that not merely in the lines of the countenance and the falling in of the cheeks, but his very bones seemed as if they partook of the suffering. He became like an old man before his time. We have heard of some who through severe trouble have had their hair blanched in a single night.",
