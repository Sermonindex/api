            "description": "Paul Washer begins this exposition of Matthew 5:5 by explaining that \u2018The Beatitudes\u2019 (verses 3-11) do not just speak of what it is to live a blessed life, but they speak of conformity to the image of Christ, for they are a great description of Jesus Christ as he walked on this earth. Many preachers say little more about meekness than showing that is not weakness; but what does the word really mean? The true meaning of any word is defined not merely through a dictionary, but by studying the context of the passage(s) where it occurs; so, using the obvious parallels between Matthew 5:5 and Psalm 37:11, Mr Washer uses the context of Psalm 37:1-11 to define the word \u2018meek\u2019. He works through the verses one by one, revealing the character of the meek man: he does not fret, nor envy the wicked; he trusts in God and dwells in the land; he delights himself in the Lord, commits his way unto the Lord, rests in the Lord, and so on. \u201cThis is what it means to be meek\u201d, says Mr Washer, \u201cand it is one of our greatest needs today\u201d.

He encourages believers to entrust their loved ones to His care and to lay down the worries and fears of praying for the unsaved. Find rest in trusting your unsaved friends and family to an all powerful and loving God. Do you know the difference between praying and committing to God?  Bill shares precious testimonies of committing loved ones to the Lord and then trusting God to do it, even though nothing perceivable is happening.  One testimony was about his own mother who committed her husband and four sons to the Lord and waited 14 years for the first one to come to Christ; all did come eventually.  \"Don't try to figure out what God is doing,\" he reassures.",
