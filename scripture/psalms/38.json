This is a message of hope and help for the backslidden, or for those who have grown lukewarm or cold. It is a sobering reality that believers have an enemy who will not be satisfied until they are dead. But greater is He that is in us, than he that is in the world.!!! (1 John 4:4)",

We are not called to have the earth bless us, we are called to bless the earth. Our cry has to be \"Jesus, touch us and cause us to see what you see and feel what you feel! Lord, cause us to have something deeper than sporadic bursts of kindness.\" Our eyes should be opened to the compassion of Christ and our hands should be committed to make a difference in society. When we move out in this direction, there is a divine power imputed to us for the work of the Lord.",

There are those who respond with remorse and repentance to this and those we do not because they have made peace with it. If you are sick of your sin, and weary of it, there is hope for God will never refuse a sincere heart. But if you are cold, and have no urgency to pray or read the word of God, no concern for the lost and are taking your sin lightly, you are on very dangerous ground. If you are being entertained by watching the sin of others on television, you are guilty of sin.",
