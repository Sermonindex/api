            "description": "Two issues, both serious are addressed. If you feel the heaviness of sin it is the mercy of God trying to draw you back to the cross so you can be saved from your sin. There are those who respond with remorse and repentance to this and those we do not because they have made peace with it. If you are sick of your sin, and weary of it, there is hope for God will never refuse a sincere heart. But if you are cold, and have no urgency to pray or read the word of God, no concern for the lost and are taking your sin lightly, you are on very dangerous ground. If you are being entertained by watching the sin of others on television, you are guilty of sin.",
