Pastor Chuck was used in the Jesus People revival where he was used along with others to minister to the hippy young people. They saw a work of the Spirit where many were added to the church and discipled. He has raised up many pastors who are a part of the Calvary Chapel movement now and where he pastors the large Costa Mesa church in California.\r\n\r\nThe Calvary Chapel movement is based of simple principles that Chuck Smith taught over the years such as: The priority of agape love, Simple fellowship amongst the saints, the breaking of bread, the teaching of God's word chapter by chapter and verse by verse. And lastly and most importantly the principle not by might nor by power but by my spirit saith the Lord.",

            "description": "The Lord in the Upper Room, in speaking to a group of 'preachers' says \"one of you shall betray me.\" In this Christ was making a personal application of Psalm 41:9 \"Yea, mine own familiar friend, in whom I trusted, which did eat of my bread, hath lifted up his heel against me.\" This was a great exposure, not only of the traitor Judas but of... 1. The Saints Sensitive Heart (they all said \"is it I?\") 2. The Social Gospel (all the teaching and example of Christ is not enough to save the soul and sin is not in the fact that Judas did not follow protocol but that his heart was not right) 3. The Sinner's Hypocrisy (Judas has become a proverb for treachery and betrayal, but Christ exposes the heart).",
