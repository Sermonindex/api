            "description": "The Lord in the Upper Room, in speaking to a group of 'preachers' says \"one of you shall betray me.\" In this Christ was making a personal application of Psalm 41:9 \"Yea, mine own familiar friend, in whom I trusted, which did eat of my bread, hath lifted up his heel against me.\" This was a great exposure, not only of the traitor Judas but of... 1. The Saints Sensitive Heart (they all said \"is it I?\") 2. The Social Gospel (all the teaching and example of Christ is not enough to save the soul and sin is not in the fact that Judas did not follow protocol but that his heart was not right) 3. The Sinner's Hypocrisy (Judas has become a proverb for treachery and betrayal, but Christ exposes the heart).",
