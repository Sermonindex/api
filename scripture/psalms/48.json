'As we have heard, so have we seen': this is seldom true. In many places we see what we have not heard, and what we have heard we do not see. Time was when many simpletons believed that the streets of London were paved with gold. I am sure I do not know any part of London in which a single lump of that metal can be found in the footway. Ten thousand idle tales there are in every country, of mines where fortunes may be dug out of the earth, and plains where wealth forces itself on the immigrant; but how seldom do we hear the good news, 'As we have heard, so have we seen.' But when you come into the 'City of the Lord of hosts, in the city of our God,' the reports about it are true, and the truth exceeds the report; for, like the Queen of Sheba, we cry, 'The half was not told me.' When we speak of the privileges of the Church of God on earth it is impossible to exaggerate. 'Behold, what manner of love the Father hath bestowed upon us, that we should be called the sons of God.' Behold, what blessings, what riches, what royalties the Lord Jesus bestows upon his chosen! How cleansed they are by his blood! How quickened by his life! How honored by his glorious enthronement at the right hand of the Father...",
