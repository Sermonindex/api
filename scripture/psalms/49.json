Psalm 49:15\r\n\r\nWhen peace, like a river, attendeth my way\r\nWhen sorrows like sea billows roll\r\nWhatever my lot, Thou hast taught me to say\r\nIt is well, it is well with my soul\r\n\r\nChorus\r\nIt is well with my soul\r\nIt is well, it is well with my soul\r\n\r\nMy sin, oh the joy of this glorious thought\r\nMy sin, not in part, but the whole\r\nIs nailed to the cross, and I bear it no more\r\nPraise the Lord, praise the Lord, oh my soul!\r\n\r\nChorus\r\n\r\nAnd Lord, haste the day when my faith shall be sight\r\nThe clouds be rolled back as a scroll\r\nThe trump shall resound and the Lord shall descend\r\n\u201cEven so,\u201d it is well with my soul\r\n\r\nChorus",
