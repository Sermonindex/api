            "description": "You can stand up to the devil and say enough! Too many Christians go to church and read their Bibles, but lack the power that only comes through full submission to the Holy Ghost, and the Word of God, to combat the powers of the enemy. You can take back your family for God, take back what the enemy has stolen from you. Pray the Lord of the Harvest will send you forth into the field.\u00a0 Don't be consenting when you behold the thief destroying and stealing\u00a0the lives of your loved ones. Stand in the gap, and defy him. He is defeated already. Powerful preaching on an important issue!!",
