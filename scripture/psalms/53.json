            "description": "February 13, 2007 - When we magnify the power of our enemies over the power of our God we place ourselves in a foolish position. God is more powerful then any enemy that comes our way. Magnifying the enemy over the greatness of our God is saying in our hearts that there is no God. There is a point in our lives when we have to face our fears and believe God to deliver us. God has already defeated every enemy we will ever face in Jesus Christ. We must understand the enemy is not defying us, but rather he is attempting to defy the Christ in us who has purchased us with His own Blood. We are called to be a compelling testimony to this generation and to show that Jesus Christ is alive.",
