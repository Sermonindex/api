            "description": "Saul was obsessed with capturing David and sought him daily but the Lord delievered David out of the hand of Saul every time.  David was oppressed in the heart of his trial so the Lord sent Jonathan to him to strenthen him. Jonathan remind David of the Lord's promises to him how David will be king of Israel and that even Saul knows this, but Jonathan goes to far in what he is saying to David and says that he will be next to David when he is king, this sadly wouldn't come to pass as Jonathan would be killed in battle beofre David even came to the throne.  When Jonathan leaves David the Ziphites go and betray David into the hand of Saul, it was then that David wrote Psalm 54 and as seen in the psalm David puts his whole trust in the Lord and his heart is filled with praise to God.  Sauls army is just about to encircle David when a messanger comes to Saul and informs him that the philistines are invading and the Israel is under attack so Saul has to leave off from David and defend Israel.",
