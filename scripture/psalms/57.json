            "description": "We need ever keep before us that we exist for the glory of God. He chose us in Christ and predestined us \u201caccording to the good pleasure of His will, to the praise of the glory of His grace, wherein He hath made us accepted in the Beloved.\u201d Man is a fallen creature, spiritually leprous, ignorant, and blind, but ever subject to the Most High. While man will want to remonstrate against such an assertion, it is still true. Every created thing comes under the holy and sovereign jurisdiction of \u2018The Most High God\u2019. That right He never foregoes. He is going to call all beings to account to Him. This challenging message brings out the ways in which this can be practically achieved by us.",

THE proper subject to treat upon with such a text as this would be the propriety and excellence of early rising, especially when we are desirous of praising or serving God. The dew of dawn should be consecrated to devotion. The text is a very remarkable expression, and might fitly be made the early-riser's motto. It is, in the original, a highly poetical phrase, and Milton and others have borrowed or imitated it. 'I will awaken the morning.' So early would the psalmist arise for the praise of God, that he would call up the day, and bid the sun arise from the chambers of the east, and proceed upon his journey. 'I will awaken the morning.' Early rising has the example of Old Testament saints to recommend it, and many modern saints having conscientiously practiced it, have been loud in its praise. It is an economy of time, and an assistance to health, and thus it doubly lengthens life. Late rising is too often the token of indolence, and the cause of disorder throughout the whole day. Be assured that the best hours are the first. Our City habits are to be deplored, because by late hours of retirement at night we find early rising difficult if not impossible. If we are able to escape the shackels of custom, and secure for devotion and contemplation the hour when the dew is on the grass, we may count ourselves thrice happy...",

David rouses himself in respect of every faculty of his God-touched and God-illumined being to be in the employ of worship. THIS is his delight. He stirs himself up so that all the powers of his soul, and every talent he was endowed with, was used to set forth God\u2019s praises. His soul cannot be dormant, inactive, or silent. As in all true spiritual awakenings, it is not possible to feel God at work in your own heart and see Him at work in the Church, without it radically affecting your entire devotional life and your spiritual worship.",
