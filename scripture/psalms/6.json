            "description": "There are many reasons Christians do not pray as they should, and this is one of the gentlest rebukes Pastor Wilkerson has given on this subject. He lovingly explains about the warfare we have to fight our way through to pray, and reveals even if we have neglected to pray as we should, God still wants us to come to him, and he will by the Holy Ghost teach us how to pray as we should. For that alone is how we learn. So stop beating yourself up and get alone with the Holy Spirit and ask him to teach you to pray.",

            "description": "May 20, 2007 - The moment we were saved the new nature of Christ was put within us. With this new nature of Christ came a deep inner longing and a groan that was put there by God. This inner groaning leads us into the depth of the life of Christ. We groan to become the new creation that God has intended us to be. Satan's most potent tactic against the righteous is to get us to feel that somehow we have fallen into disfavor with God in times of deep inner troubling, when in reality something more deep is going on inside of us. God by His grace will put a groaning in our heart to know Christ in His power and Truth and nothing but CHRIST will satisfy us.",

All these temptations are common to man and God will be FAITHFUL to bring us out. There is a sovereign move of God coming to the church of Jesus Christ and He will open up our hearts to the truth of His Word. Our enemies will be put to shame. They will leave suddenly and will not be able to fulfill the assignment they have over your life.",
