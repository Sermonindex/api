            "description": "Using many more scriptures, Pastor Wilkerson illustrates how believers in the Bible suffered afflictions, and how God brought them out. The scriptures testify there will be suffering involved in serving God,\u00a0 and our faith is refined when we go through the fire and come out still believing God. And he is glorified. God will not fail you, he will not turn you over to the enemy. Israel couldn't believe or accept the love God had for them, causing an entire generation to perish in the wilderness. Understand that not only does God love his children, he delights in them as well. Even in our hardships and trials, God delights in us.",

            "description": "A very powerful testimony of conversion not by a man but by God who wrought a wonderful work of regeneration in mr. campbells soul. He recieved the baptism with the Holy Spirit and was used powerfully in the revival of 1921. Then he went through a barren wilderness for 17 years in the ministry. But again God revived his heart and he experienced the outpouring of the Holy Spirit in the famous Hebrides Revival. The summation of this testimony is very powerful where he asks the listener if God could do this for him why not us? are we willing to 'go through with God' at any cost?",
