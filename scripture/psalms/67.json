            "description": "June 25, 2006 \u2013 There is a deep abiding inner peace that only comes from Jesus. This peace is deep within those who know and understan Christ and trust that God has everything under control. When God's word is intwined in our heart and mind we will be led down a pathway of peace. This peace is the mark of the work of God. However, when we begin to leave the single pursuit of gloriying God and begin to find pleasure in this world your heart will turn from truth. You wil find yourself being led away form the will of God , led away by a lust to satisfy self, and you will lose the desire to be a servant.",
