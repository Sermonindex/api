            "description": "Using many more scriptures, Pastor Wilkerson illustrates how believers in the Bible suffered afflictions, and how God brought them out. The scriptures testify there will be suffering involved in serving God,\u00a0 and our faith is refined when we go through the fire and come out still believing God. And he is glorified. God will not fail you, he will not turn you over to the enemy. Israel couldn't believe or accept the love God had for them, causing an entire generation to perish in the wilderness. Understand that not only does God love his children, he delights in them as well. Even in our hardships and trials, God delights in us.",

            "description": "There are so many in the bible who had this zeal in their hearts. A certain woman came to my mind and that is Rebekah. Listen to what she said when she wanted the blessing for her child. It was something beautiful. When she heard her husband was going to bless her oldest son, she said. \"My son, Jacob, must take it. He must have the blessing.\" What did she do? She came to him and said, \"Now therefore my son, obey my voice according to what I command you\" (Gen 27:8). Here was a woman who wanted the best for her son. Do we have such mothers in our midst? She commanded him. She didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t say you can choose whether you follow the Lord or not. You are old enough you can decide who you will serve. She had a zeal in her heart and she commanded him and he had to do it. When she heard that her husband wanted to bless the older son, she immediately said, \"That the blessing must come upon my younger son\" and she said, \"You must obey what I command you to do.\" May God raise mothers again who have authority and say you must do what I command you to do. Mothers, is that your life? That you command your children and they do it?",

            "description": "November 27, 2005 - Time and time again the enemy will come after our mind with a demonic flood of accusations to move you away from our true identity and righteousness that we have in Jesus Christ. God will arise above this flood and fight for us by showing us clearly the eternal future of satan. God will open up the earth and show us that we are redeemed and set free from every judgment satan spews at us. He will show us that actually it is satan who id judged and it is satan who will eternally burn in hell.",
