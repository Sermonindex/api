I can sum up the American church today as described by a recent visit of an Oriental pastor who came to America to see for himself what the churches were like. He said, \u201cFirst, karaoke, then a lecture.\u201d That sums it up friends. We have very little preaching in our pulpits today. It is mainly teaching, teaching informs, teaching transforms. The message you\u2019re about to hear is not a politically correct gospel, rather it is a full presentation of the gospel of the Son of God preached in the full counsel of God.",

When we are not sarisfied with where God has placed us in the body we will by into the lie of the devil and begiin to complain against God. There is a reward for those who choose to go God's way and learn to be content in whatever state we find ourselves in.",
