Was evidently a prophet from God for the 20th Century. With a profound sense of the absolute sovereignty and glory of Jesus Christ, he was able to preach a message that produced conviction of sin. He maintained through all his ministry what he himself called a \"sweetheart love for the Lord Jesus,\" and it is most surely apparent in his messages.\r\n\r\nHe was an acclaimed preacher of primarily the 1940's and 1950's.About 100,000 professed faith in Christ during his decades of preaching. He was initially associated with John R.Rice in the 1940's. However,after giving a scripturally based message on John 6 Before rice and some other fundamentalist leaders he was kicked out of the Fundamentalist camp. He then went on the independent circuit. His preaching tours as an evangelist were mainly in the American south.But he also ministered in the mid-west and Canada as well.",

I can sum up the American church today as described by a recent visit of an Oriental pastor who came to America to see for himself what the churches were like. He said, \u201cFirst, karaoke, then a lecture.\u201d That sums it up friends. We have very little preaching in our pulpits today. It is mainly teaching, teaching informs, teaching transforms. The message you\u2019re about to hear is not a politically correct gospel, rather it is a full presentation of the gospel of the Son of God preached in the full counsel of God.",
