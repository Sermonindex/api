It means to let God Almighty take over, to shut you in with Himself so that wherever we are, whatever we do, we do and we are by Him, glory to God!  \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Father, I in them, and Thou in Me.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d I think we see something of that in the life of Jesus.  We know that God Almighty lived in Him, walked in Him, controlled Him\u00e2\u20ac\u201dHis mind, His words.  He said, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The words that I speak unto you, I speak not of myself, but the Father that dwelleth in me\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6\u00e2\u20ac\u009d  It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a great secret: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153He that seeth Me hath seen the Father.  Why sayest thou, \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcShow us the Father\u00e2\u20ac\u2122?\u00e2\u20ac\u009d  And so He says, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153He that eateth Me shall live by Me.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d  \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Father, I in them\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6\u00e2\u20ac\u009d",
