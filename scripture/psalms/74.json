He started to study the word of God and started to minister in many conventions including with James Robinson and Leonard Ravenhill.\r\nSome of his main Biblical burdens was to teach the whole counsel of God and to share how to be free from sin and carnality in Christian life. He clearly showed through his teachings on to recognize and have victory through Jesus Christ over the powers of darkness.",

            "description": "\"A Time To Cry\" - a time to cry. Solomon said in Ecclesiastes chapter 3 and verse 4: 'There is a time to weep, and there is a time to laugh; there is a time to mourn, and there is a time to dance'. In some quarters of the church there is a great emphasis today on laughing and on dancing. Today it seems that the church, God's people, sleep instead of weep. They are merry instead of mourning. I do not believe that the church today, especially in the West, is living in a day of laughter and in a day of rejoicing. They might feel themselves to be, they might have been spellbound like those in Galatians chapter 3, where Paul could say to them: 'Who hath bewitched you', who has cast this spell, hypnotised you into believing something as it is not? I believe that, for the child of God today, our day should be a day of weeping and a day of mourning. I believe that it is a time to cry.\r\n\r\n[i]All material by Pastor Legge is copyrighted.

They settle for less than God intended for them. I have to say that there can even be resentment, or resistance, shown toward anyone who will try to get God's people over the Jordan and into their inheritance.\" - David Legge",

These voices will say you can't go any farther with God. This message reminds us that it is the LORD who sets the boundaries in the Earth and the truth is that it is the devil who could only go as far as the bloodline of Jesus Christ. It is time to rise up in faith and tell whatever voice is telling us \"we can't\", that God can! God desires to stretch forth His hand and heal us so we can be agents of healing to the unsaved.",
