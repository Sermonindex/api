            "description": "Brother Gehard shares on the diferences between humility and pride. God lifts up the humble person. He will be highly respected by his fellow man as he is with God. Humility is the opposite of self-centred pride. If you are humble, you consider yourself the servant of others. You do not feel or act superior to others and you are not a respecter of persons.",
