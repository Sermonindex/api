            "description": "August 13, 2006. The present wrath that is in the world today is beyond human nature. This wrath is a satanic rage of the powers of darkness against the Lamb of God.But the word of God promises that that the wrath of satan will have to praise God. When Jesus comes on the scene there is no power of hell that can stand against Him. Where sin abounds the grace of God much abounds in a greater measure. In these last days of darkness there is going to be an out pouring of divine grace on every nation.The gates of hell will not prevail against the church of Jesus Christ. The weapon for every child of God is the power of the promises of God.",
