Kenaston shows God's purpose to train up many generation families to win a lost and dying world, showing several examples from the Bible.  If God did it for them, He can do it for you!",

We don't know the journey God is taking us but he does. God will test and prove his people along this journey as he did Israel in the wilderness to see if we will believe and obey him. He wants us not living on bread (prosperity) promises alone, but by every promise in the Word of God. To not fully trust God is to strip him of all he wants to be and can be to us and bring him down to the level of a dead idol. It's a grievous sin in God's eyes to have unbelief, and the church needs to realize it.",

Thinking wrong in our hearts hinders our praise, and we might not even realize we slander the Lord by negative thoughts. Most of us would say we haven't slandered God. Every Christian should listen to this message, and find out for sure. You know God worked for you in the past but do you wonder if he's going to help you this time? That is one example of slandering your heavenly Father. This message will challenge and enlighten all who listen with an open heart.",

Many turn back right at the place where they will begin to discover and enter into the supernatural life of God. When we are in unbelief we begin to limit God by doubting that He could supply what we need and take us where He is calling us to go. The central core of unbelief is that God's way is incomplete and we must help Him bring His plan to pass. If you are sitting in unbelief, remove yourself from that place and grab on to the promises of God. We must learn how to trust God for strength and provision. Don't pray to get out of the situation, pray that you may find supernatural life in it. God is looking for people who have come through the wilderness with a voice of triumph to speak to the next generation. Do you believe that God CAN, or will you limit the Holy One of Israel?",
