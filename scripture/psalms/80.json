            "description": "Brother Melton captures the essence of biblical\/historical revival and those who would seek it in this message. Drawing amply from the scriptures, he paints a portrait of the revival spirit in its simplicity and pureness. He delivers with passion and brokenness as he accurately identifies the single reason why we do not see revival in our day. Listen, find out, be transformed.",

The basic fruit of the Spirit is love it is at the heart of all the other fruits, the basis for the works of the flesh is self. A great truth is revealed in this message that we do not bear fruit by asking for it but by confessing and dealing with our sin then the Lord will help us to bear fruit.",
