            "description": "Guzik teaches not only how to pray for revival but when and what to pray.  In addition his careful handling of God's Word, he cites pertinent and interesting examples from revivals from the not-so-distant past such as James McGrady in 1800, the American revival of 1858 and the Welsh revival in early 1900's.  He deals with misconceptions of praying only for leaders and not whole congregations, pointing out from Acts how the Holy Spirit fills both individuals and entire congregations.  Guzik appeals to let go of the 'machinery' of men to earnestly seek God in prayer for 'a unique stirring of the Spirit of God' in our day!",

The breakdown of public morals and the break-up of the traditional home are well-documented. It is no longer that America merely needs revival. She must experience it! The question is: \u201cIs it too late?\u201d Are we desperate enough to hold on to God and plead, \u201cWilt thou not revive us again?\u201d Are we impatient or importunate? Do we wish for revival or do we will it? The hour is late, but God's mercy is great!",

Campbell shared several practical \"principles that govern spiritual quickening.\"  The differences between a God-sent revival and the man-centered evangelistic means of his day are truly heart-searching for anyone engaged in work to save men's souls.  Since God's sovereignty does not nullify man's responsibility, Campbell admonished his hearers to be \"agents of revival\" that take God up on \"His covenant engagement\" in prayer and staying close to the heart of the Shepherd.",
