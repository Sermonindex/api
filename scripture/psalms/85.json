Bill Mcleod was the pastor of Ebenezer Baptist Church for many years where ultimately God sent revival to that affecting much of Canada. He had a passion to know God and His word. Paul Washer said he was one of the most godly men he met in Canada.\r\n\r\nBill Mcleod had been praying and had his congregation praying for revival for years. On, October 17, 1971, God in His sovereignty came in revival. Without human means or explanation, the revival spread from church to church, community to community, city to city, and not long after from province to province. This has become known as the 1971 Canadian Revival movement.",

In addition his careful handling of God's Word, he cites pertinent and interesting examples from revivals from the not-so-distant past such as James McGrady in 1800, the American revival of 1858 and the Welsh revival in early 1900's.  He deals with misconceptions of praying only for leaders and not whole congregations, pointing out from Acts how the Holy Spirit fills both individuals and entire congregations.  Guzik appeals to let go of the 'machinery' of men to earnestly seek God in prayer for 'a unique stirring of the Spirit of God' in our day!",

We as Christians have to make a choice to live in this world as a testimony of the keeping power of God. The cry of the church should be, \u201cLord, stretch forth you hand and heal through me. Use my life to bring healing and freedom to those who are lost.\u201d What will revival look like? All people with a no name ministry will suddenly show up with the glory of God on them. Grandmothers who laid hold of the Cross will begin to speak to a younger generation. Young people like David in the Bible who will not cower under the pressure of this society will rise up with a cry that says, \"is there not a cause?\" There is coming a season when God will turn the people\u2019s hearts back to Him and He will pour out His Spirit on all flesh.",

Campbell shared several practical \"principles that govern spiritual quickening.\"  The differences between a God-sent revival and the man-centered evangelistic means of his day are truly heart-searching for anyone engaged in work to save men's souls.  Since God's sovereignty does not nullify man's responsibility, Campbell admonished his hearers to be \"agents of revival\" that take God up on \"His covenant engagement\" in prayer and staying close to the heart of the Shepherd.",
