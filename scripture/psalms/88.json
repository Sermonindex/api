Many are seeking God for personal gain as opposed to the feeding the hungry. God is calling His church to reach out and touch His heart so that we might be an extension of His heart and hands to a lost generation. He's calling us to be hope for the hopeless and freedom to the captives and food for every hungry heart. This power of God is extended to us through His crucified hands.",
