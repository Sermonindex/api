            "description": "Why do believers continue in sin?  Year after year after year they continue in some sort of sin and they never come into the fullness of the Covenant blessing of God.  Often times it may well just be one area that remains but nonetheless folks continue in that sin.  Wilkerson preaches a very personal message here and he shares his heart and shows his own weakness as an example.  The consequences for a Christian continuing in sin are sobering, but he gave us what we needed to overcome sin, if we want to. For those who are sick of their sin, and hate it, and cry out to God, there is wonderful news. He will empower you, and he wants to put his fear in your heart so you will not turn away from him, and then he can take you into the fullness of the new covenant. Powerful preaching, with a gentle compassion for those who are struggling.",

            "description": "A SERMON DELIVERED ON SABBATH MORNING, FEBRUARY 25, 1855, BY THE REV. C. H. SPURGEON, AT EXETER HALL, STRAND. \u201cI have exalted one chosen out of the people.\u201d \u2014 Psalm 89:19. ORIGINALLY, I have no doubt, these words referred to David... However, in this sermon we shall not speak of David, but of the Lord Jesus Christ, for David, as referred to in the text, is an eminent type of Jesus Christ, our Lord and Savior, who was chosen out of the people; and of whom his Father can say \u201cI have exalted one chosen out of the people.\u201d Before I enter into the illustration of this truth I wish to make one statement, so that all objections may be avoided as to the doctrine of my sermon. Our Savior Jesus Christ, I say, was chosen out of the people; but this merely respects his manhood. As \u201cvery God of very God\u201d he was not chosen out of the people, for there was none save him. He was his Father\u2019s only-begotten Son, \u201cbegotten of the Father before all worlds.\u201d He was God\u2019s fellow, co-equal, and co-eternal; consequently when we speak of Jesus as being chosen out of the people, we must speak of him as a man. We are, I conceive, too forgetful of the real manhood of our Redeemer, for a man he was to all intents and purposes, and I love to sing, \u201cA Man there was, a real Man Who once on Calvary died.\u201d He was not man and God amalgamated \u2014 the two natures suffered no confusion \u2014 he was very God, without the diminution of his essence or attributes...",

In modern evangelical circles he is stated to be the \"Prince of Preachers.\" He pastored the Metropolitan Tabernacle in downtown London, England. \r\n\r\nHis church was part of a particular baptist church movement and they defended and preached Christ and Him crucified and the purity of the Gospel message. Spurgeon never gave altar calls but always extended the invitation to come to Christ. He was a faithful minister in his time that glorified God and brought many to the living Christ.",
