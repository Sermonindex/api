Psalm 93 shows the Lord Jesus as entire Creator and absolute Lord.  Then Psalm 94 comes along and it seems like the wickedness of man is triumphing.  When by all appearances it seems that Christ is not reigning, faith sees Christ's throne infinitely higher than the mightiest waves that pound against it!",
