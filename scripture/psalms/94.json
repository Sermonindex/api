Psalm 93 shows the Lord Jesus as entire Creator and absolute Lord.  Then Psalm 94 comes along and it seems like the wickedness of man is triumphing.  When by all appearances it seems that Christ is not reigning, faith sees Christ's throne infinitely higher than the mightiest waves that pound against it!",

The judgment that is now in the church is not to condemn us , rather it is to return us to righteousness and to make us more like Christ so we can be vessels that truly honor God. God is faithful to come against everything in our heart that is unlike Him .A true Christian will both invite and embrace the judgment of God.",
