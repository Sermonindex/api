            "description": "Daniel saw a great vision of a man clothed very much like the Lord Jesus at the start of Revelation. In this passage we read of an angel coming to Daniel to answer his prayer on the very day that Daniel lifted his hands up to the Lord God , yet this angel was resisted and hindered by demonic forces within the spirit realm, thus the answer didn't get through to Daniel till the 21st day, this is a great lesson in persistent and prevailing prayer as the answer would not have come to Daniel if he had given up on the 19th day, the angelic messenger was of course helped by Micheal who seems to have a protective role over the nation of Israel.  In the prophetic vision that is revealed to Daniel the king of the north is the king of Syria and the king of the south the king of Egypt, historically these 2 kings were 2 of Alexander the greats generals which have been mentioned before, and Israel was caught inbetween their disputes, this was just before the reign of Antiochus, the antichristn of the Old Testament.",

            "description": "The time known as 'Jacobs trouble' will be the worst persecution that has ever befallen the jewish people, which is saying a lot considering they have been the target of satanic persecution all along, and we know the reason for this is due to the fact that the jews are so wrapped up in God's eternal plan.In the midst of this time of persecution there will be a great opportunity to spread the gospel though.  The prophecy laid out here will have it's fulfillment in the end times, it will be a period of 3 and a half years and will be so intense that it will cause the people of Israel to cry out to their Messiah and He will return and defend them from the last onslaught.  Interestingly Pastor Guzik says that 'running to and fro and knowledge shall increase' speaks of the huge explosion in understanding of Biblical prophecy that has occured in the past 100 years.",

Some look at the Crystal and say it is green, and others say \"no its red.\"  But the mature one walks around the Crystal and says \"your both right\" It is the same with the gospel in the scriptures.  There are many different ingredients that make up the recipe of the gospel.  This series attempts to show all the ingredients of the gospel.  This is important because if our recipe is different than Gods, then we will not get the same result found in the book of Acts.",

Though servant leaders are submitted to, there is no one brother over all fellowships controlling them. True submission to authority in the Church should not be because of someone who was voted in or hired but because of their spiritual walk with the Lord.

He has been building a pure pristine Book of Acts fellowship in House Church networks all over rural China. There is a simplicity to the move of God yet such fervency, love, and desire born in the hearts of these believers. We need to break out of the simple 1 hour church meeting patterns, and start to serve the Lord with full commitment like many of these precious brothers and sisters in the Lord. For many of us the questions and truths that are revealed are very important for us to hear as we gather under the Headship of Jesus Christ in local areas.",

WHILE reading this description given by John of what he saw in the isle called Patmos, I think you must have noticed that it would be quite impossible for any painter to depict it upon canvas, and equally impossible for any sculptor to embody it in stone or marble. Those who have attempted to copy the lines here given have signally failed; they may paint a picture of the garment down to the feet, and the golden girdle; but the rest, if it be viewed from an artist's aspect, would be found to be incongruous: \u201cHis head and his hairs were white like wool, as white as snow; and his eyes were as a flame of fire.\u201d No great painter would ever venture to give us a portrait of our Lord with his head and his hair \u201cwhite like wool, as white as snow.\u201d If he did, it would be quite impossible to depict eyes that were \u201cas a flame of fire.\u201d How would it be possible to make us realize, with the aid of any pen or pencil, that his feet were \u201clike unto fine brass, as if they burned in a furnace\u201d?",

THE text speaks of a voice from heaven which said, \u201cBlessed are the dead which die in the Lord.\u201d The witness of that voice is not needed upon every occasion, for even the commonest observer is compelled to feel concerning many of the righteous that their deaths are blessed. Balaam, with all his moral shortsightedness, could say, \u201cLet me die the death of the righteous, and let my last end be like his.\u201d That is the case when death comes in peaceful fashion. The man has lived a calm, godly, consistent life; he has lived as long as he could well have wished to live, and in dying he sees his children and his children's children gathered around his bed. What a fine picture the old man makes, as he sits up with that snowy head supported by snowy pillows. Hear him as he tells his children that goodness and mercy have followed him all the days of his life, and now he is going to dwell in the house of the Lord for ever...",

So then because thou art lukewarm, and neither cold nor hot, I will spue thee out of my mouth. Because thou sayest, I am rich, and increased with goods, and have need of nothing, and knowest not that thou art wretched, and miserable, and poor, and blind, and naked: I counsel thee to buy of me gold tried in the fire, that thou mayest be rich, and white raiment, that thou mayest be clothed, and that the shame of thy nakedness do not appear; and anoint thine eyes with eyesalve, that thou mayest see. As many as I love I rebuke and chasten: be zealous therefore, and repent. Behold, I stand at the door, and knock: if any man hear my voice, and open the door, I will come into him, and will sup with him, and he with me. To him that overcometh will I grant to sit with me in my throne, even as I also overcame, and am set down with my Father in his throne.\u201d \u2014 Revelation 3:14-21. No Scripture ever wears out.

He sets before you and open door and if you walk through it you will experience the supernatural strength of God.

            "description": "Dr. Thompson begins discussing the idea that we do not wrestle against flesh and blood, but against principalities, etc. He discusses the dynamics of spiritual warfare, including the concept of \u201ctwo armies\u201d \u2013 An army of warriors (angels) and an army of judges (men). The delay in Christ\u2019s return has to do with the fact that the \u201carmy of judges\u201d is not ready yet, he says. This life of trials and tests is to form Christ in us \u2013 which makes us ready to judge and rule with Him. He segues into the purpose of the blood of Christ: it forgives our sins, it cleanses sin, it covers us (for protection), it nourishes the inner man, it deadens the power of sin over you, and it will literally remove the sin from you (at His coming). The sermon is much more interesting than I\u2019m making it sound.",

We cannot limit Jesus suffering to mere physical suffering, otherwise sin could be dealt with and atoned for with every human death, and that would be sufficient for entrance into heaven.  With a true understanding and acknowledgment of the spiritual and infinite sufferings of Christ should also come a truth which breaks us free from our love of sin.  If we only ever see God as a means to our physical need, then we are missing the point of the New Covenant entirely.

There wasn\u2019t a funeral at the creation of the world; there was an anthem, and all the creature creations sang!

Those not too proud to admit they need God. Saul and David are contrasted in a way that helps listeners understand the importance of humbling ourselves before God, and trusting his decisions and submitting to his authority.",

Put your thinking cap on for this one because you will have to determine who the believers are who will go through the Tribulation period",

Traditionally, John is identified with the author of the Fourth Gospel. Addressed to seven historical churches in Asia Minor, the Book of Revelation was written to warn against spiritual indifference and to elicit courage under persecution. Because of the extensive use of symbolism and picturesque imagery, its interpretation has posed many problem for the student of the Bible. While recognizing the historical situation (Roman persecution) that elicited this writing, many interpreters look upon it as a prophecy depicting events that were to take place at the end of the age. The ultimate victory of Christ is the dominant theme of this book.",

No matter what storm we face as believers, we have Christ in the ship, so let's get away from the focus on self and focus on those around us who don't know the Savior!

            "description": "Here in Revelation is a court room like no other, there is a Judge, but no jury, no plea, no bargaining, no defense attorney, only judgement.  The great white throne mentioned here is great because of the Great Judge that sits upon it, He is the the Lord of lords and King of kings, the Lord Jesus Himself.  The throne is white because of the purity of Him who sits upon it who cannot even look upon sin His eyes are so holy. In this passage we hear of His face from whom everything, even the great expanse of the cosmos flees away, except for the unrepentent sinnner before Him.  Here at the great white throne everything will be revealed even down to the idle words they spoke, the fearful thing about this court room is that after the judgement there is only eternal Hell.\r\n\r\n[i]All material by Pastor Legge is copyrighted.

            "description": "October 21, 2007 - When the church of Jesus Christ begins to portray a wrong image of God, it opens the door for uncalled and unfaithful men to take positions as spiritual leaders. The end result of standing before the wrong image of God will lead the people into a theological perspective that is based on human optimism as opposed to sacrifice and truth. The true image of God represents Jesus Christ, the Cross , His sacrifice and all that is Holy. If we are going to know the true image of God, we will be led to a place where we are undone, where everything that we thought we were has to die. We must take joyfully the spoils of all of our religious goods and come before this image of the TRUE and Holy God. It is only in the presence of Jesus Christ that we are turned from image to image by the Glory of God.",

            "description": "September 19, 2010 - What makes a church great? Is it the worship? Baptism of the Holy Spirit? Prophecy? Faith to move mountains? These are all good things but God's call for greatness is higher. If we don\u2019t have the love of God all these things count for nothing. We are called to put away childish things such as grievances, unforgiveness, envy, pride and anger and begin to love others like Jesus loves us. This is impossible to do without the power of the Holy Spirit. Christ in us gives us the power to go beyond human limitations into the supernatural love of God. The indisputable evidence of a great church is the love we have for one another. It is something of God working in us and through us.",

            "description": "A deeply moving wake-up call to the church, instructing her to live in the light of eternity, \"for we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ\" (2 Corinthians 5:10). Leonard Ravenhill describes the judgment day from Scripture as a court day  where the verdict is final. He first points to the judgment of the unjust and then focusses on the judgment of the righteous. He emphasizes that we will all stand before Jesus alone and will not only be judged for what we have done, but also for what we have not done that we should have done. He denounces the worldliness of the people of God who invest their time and money as the world does - thus building on wood, hay and stubble as opposed to silver, gold and precious stones. Leonard Ravenhill strongly opposes today's \"sloppy gospel\" and \"sloppy evangelism\"  of a love with no judgment. He warns that we are passing from the mercy of the lamb to the wrath of the lamb when Jesus judges the earth and mercy will be gone forever. As the work of every human being shall be tried in the fire, many public ministries will go down in ashes. Leonard describes 95 % of believers as bound by superstition and theology. He criticizes the unjust money-making of public ministries that leads to false investments of large amounts of money. He states that we must have Jesus take the government over our lives in reality and be lost and consumed in Him. Ravenhill closes his sermon with a strong call to repentance: \"If we cannot live as a different breed of people on this earth we have no right to live here. God stamp eternity on my eyeballs.\"",

This happens when we forget our dependency on Jesus and become casual with His presence. When we become familiar with the presence of God we develop a \"we don't need the Holy Spirit because we have everything all figured out\" type attitude. When we do this, we are separating ourselves from the Spirit of God and we are operating with our natural senses. God's spirit will not strive with man and He will not share His glory with anyone. We must watch for and maintain a determination in our hearts that all that we do is for the glory of God and for the testimony of His power.",

He clearly shows from Scripture there will be a world-wide persecution of Christians in the end-times. That this world-wide persecution will be one of the great signs of the soon coming of the Lord Jesus Christ. He shares even for America that persecution is increasing and potentially coming very soon.",

For example when you're cut, your body immediately reacts and sends the white blood cells to fight the infection. The dead white blood cells are then expelled as puss. In the same way the Blood of Christ cleanses us from all unrighteousness to counter any poison of sin that enters. The blood is like petrol that allows your body to function. The other members of the body remains in its place, but the blood is present right through your body. The blood also carries oxygen throughout your body. It also gets rid of impurities and acts like a refuse remover. We speak so glibly about the Blood of Christ, little realising what it does. It brings us life and that's why the devil hates it.",

In the Jewish understanding any part of a day is counted as a day and night (and even in our own time measurement, for example if a child should be born at 11.59pm, his birthday would still be counted on that day, and if born the next minute his birthday would be counted with the next day. So whether you were born 12.01am or 11.59pm, almost 24h apart, your birthday would still be counted on that day!). So those three hours on Friday would be counted as a full day and night, according to the Jewish reckoning. Then you have the full Saturday (counting from the evening) and then part of Sunday again (starting in the evening again, counted as a full day and night) when He arose. The full time in the grave would then be counted, as per the Jews way of timekeeping, as three days and nights.",

            "description": "This is a powerful message about the church of Laodicea and much of the Western church of this day.  The message is centered on the verses between Revelation 3:14 to 3:22  Carter also uses verses from Mark chapter 4 to show the disciples fearfulness and lack of concern for others when they were in storm with Jesus in the boat.  The church of Laodicea had the same lack of concern for others with the self-centered life that they were in.  In Isaiah chapter 58, the message speaks of the fast that God has chosen instead of the fasts of pretence that the people of that time were doing.  Like the church of Laodicea, the people of Isaiah\u2019s day were living life for themselves with no concern or grief for the poor or suffering.  With these verses the message went into a parallel with much of the church of today that looks for self-help books, or seminaries, or even counseling without seeking God or God\u2019s word for problems.  Carter encourages married people with problems to look to Ephesians chapter 5 for an answer to problems instead of the counsel of someone who suggests that all your problems are from your third and forth generation.  The message ends with words about revival using the revival of Ezra where it speaks of the people weeping. Revival has a strange mixture of weeping and joy.  In revival the hearts of the people are broken and there is remorse.  The church of Laodicea did not weep for others.",

This is one of the best illustrations of the Lord Jesus Christ-it's not so much a sermon as a verbal portrait painted with love and care of our Lord that every Christian needs to hear. It will change how you deal with others and it will forever change how you see the Lord if you listen with an open and hungry heart. He goes through many Scriptures, so I'd recommend having a pencil and paper on hand.",

Part of his bride is wayward, and does not spend time with him, and only seems to love him when it is convenient or doesn't cost anything. The longing in the heart of the Lord to bring again those who have drifted away is astonishing and will amaze you as Pastor Conlon reveals the mercy and grace of our Lord.",

When the Son of God knocks on the door of your heart to put what you know about Him into practice, how will you respond? We are called to take everything God has given to us and use it for the betterment of human suffering. This doesn't make sense to the natural man who will choose self preservation and stay locked behind a closed door fellowship. If you reach out to the widow and the hungry in a time of famine, the treasure of Jesus Christ will be unlocked to you. When we turn our hearts away from helping the poor and needy, we rob ourselves of the presence of God. Jesus stands at the door and knocks and if you will open the door He will give you provision to feed the hungry, clothe the naked and touch the heart of a sin-sick world. Let your heart come into agreement with what God speaks for your life. If you have resisted this call Jesus is willing to knock again.",

Carter points out that a Christians life of self denial involves continuous change and that it is important not to rely on past or present people, places, or things. We go from glory to glory and there is a constant need for change. When Christians refuse to change, they stay in secure places and do things even in worship that that are the way they have always done them. Churches that that once had fire can become dead by not changing. Carter went to Rev 2 with the church of Ephesus as an example of a church without change leaving it's first love for familiarity. Carter used the example of Peter getting out of the boat to walk on water of a person who gets away from the security of familiar circumstances to follow the Lord's bidding. Hebrews 13;14 Was quoted early by Carter, \"We have no continuing city\".",
