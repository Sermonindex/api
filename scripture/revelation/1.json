            "description": "Daniel saw a great vision of a man clothed very much like the Lord Jesus at the start of Revelation. In this passage we read of an angel coming to Daniel to answer his prayer on the very day that Daniel lifted his hands up to the Lord God , yet this angel was resisted and hindered by demonic forces within the spirit realm, thus the answer didn't get through to Daniel till the 21st day, this is a great lesson in persistent and prevailing prayer as the answer would not have come to Daniel if he had given up on the 19th day, the angelic messenger was of course helped by Micheal who seems to have a protective role over the nation of Israel.  In the prophetic vision that is revealed to Daniel the king of the north is the king of Syria and the king of the south the king of Egypt, historically these 2 kings were 2 of Alexander the greats generals which have been mentioned before, and Israel was caught inbetween their disputes, this was just before the reign of Antiochus, the antichristn of the Old Testament.",

SPURGEON, AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON, ON LORD'S-DAY EVENING, APRIL 26TH, 1885. \u201cHe had in his right hand seven stars: and out of his mouth went a sharp two-edged sword: and his countenance was as the sun shineth in his strength.\u201d \u2014 Revelation 1:16. WHILE reading this description given by John of what he saw in the isle called Patmos, I think you must have noticed that it would be quite impossible for any painter to depict it upon canvas, and equally impossible for any sculptor to embody it in stone or marble. Those who have attempted to copy the lines here given have signally failed; they may paint a picture of the garment down to the feet, and the golden girdle; but the rest, if it be viewed from an artist's aspect, would be found to be incongruous: \u201cHis head and his hairs were white like wool, as white as snow; and his eyes were as a flame of fire.\u201d No great painter would ever venture to give us a portrait of our Lord with his head and his hair \u201cwhite like wool, as white as snow.\u201d If he did, it would be quite impossible to depict eyes that were \u201cas a flame of fire.\u201d How would it be possible to make us realize, with the aid of any pen or pencil, that his feet were \u201clike unto fine brass, as if they burned in a furnace\u201d?",

The true image of God represents Jesus Christ, the Cross , His sacrifice and all that is Holy. If we are going to know the true image of God, we will be led to a place where we are undone, where everything that we thought we were has to die.

In the Jewish understanding any part of a day is counted as a day and night (and even in our own time measurement, for example if a child should be born at 11.59pm, his birthday would still be counted on that day, and if born the next minute his birthday would be counted with the next day. So whether you were born 12.01am or 11.59pm, almost 24h apart, your birthday would still be counted on that day!). So those three hours on Friday would be counted as a full day and night, according to the Jewish reckoning. Then you have the full Saturday (counting from the evening) and then part of Sunday again (starting in the evening again, counted as a full day and night) when He arose. The full time in the grave would then be counted, as per the Jews way of timekeeping, as three days and nights.",
