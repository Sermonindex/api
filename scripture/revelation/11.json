He methodically dissects chapter 11, explaining the symbology of the two witnesses and their resurrection, citing different martyrs who stood for Christ and testified against the Roman Antichrist.  He concludes with chapter 12 by unfolding the meaning of the woman clothed with the sun and other symbols.",
