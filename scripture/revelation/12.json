The prophecy laid out here will have it's fulfillment in the end times, it will be a period of 3 and a half years and will be so intense that it will cause the people of Israel to cry out to their Messiah and He will return and defend them from the last onslaught.  Interestingly Pastor Guzik says that 'running to and fro and knowledge shall increase' speaks of the huge explosion in understanding of Biblical prophecy that has occured in the past 100 years.",

The delay in Christ\u2019s return has to do with the fact that the \u201carmy of judges\u201d is not ready yet, he says. This life of trials and tests is to form Christ in us \u2013 which makes us ready to judge and rule with Him. He segues into the purpose of the blood of Christ: it forgives our sins, it cleanses sin, it covers us (for protection), it nourishes the inner man, it deadens the power of sin over you, and it will literally remove the sin from you (at His coming).

Prayer and reading the Word of God are necessary, but you must understand how to appropriate the blood of Jesus, how to stand on the accomplished work of the cross when the devil tries to bring you into condemnation or load you down with guilt over your failures. This is the secret of victory. \"And they overcame him by the blood and by the word of their testimony, and they loved not their lives to the death.\" Rev. 12:11. Powerful! A must hear for those who struggle with condemnation and guilt.",

The language is a 'divine cartoon' that can be translated by those who know the facts.  Parkyns unveils the meaning of the woman clothed with the sun, the dragon making war, and other symbols in the chapter, showing the triumph of the Lord Jesus Christ over Satan intermingled with the suffering and persecution that goes on to the present hour.",
