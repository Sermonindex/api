            "description": "The time known as 'Jacobs trouble' will be the worst persecution that has ever befallen the jewish people, which is saying a lot considering they have been the target of satanic persecution all along, and we know the reason for this is due to the fact that the jews are so wrapped up in God's eternal plan.In the midst of this time of persecution there will be a great opportunity to spread the gospel though.  The prophecy laid out here will have it's fulfillment in the end times, it will be a period of 3 and a half years and will be so intense that it will cause the people of Israel to cry out to their Messiah and He will return and defend them from the last onslaught.  Interestingly Pastor Guzik says that 'running to and fro and knowledge shall increase' speaks of the huge explosion in understanding of Biblical prophecy that has occured in the past 100 years.",

He discusses the differences and similarities between the old and new covenants. He discusses the difference between preaching and witnessing. He talks about how Jesus doesn\u2019t judge us based upon what we believe, but rather based upon what we do and how we live each day. We witness by what we are and how we live, not by what we say. The second half of this sermon is very strong. (53 minutes 54 seconds)",

The delay in Christ\u2019s return has to do with the fact that the \u201carmy of judges\u201d is not ready yet, he says. This life of trials and tests is to form Christ in us \u2013 which makes us ready to judge and rule with Him. He segues into the purpose of the blood of Christ: it forgives our sins, it cleanses sin, it covers us (for protection), it nourishes the inner man, it deadens the power of sin over you, and it will literally remove the sin from you (at His coming). The sermon is much more interesting than I\u2019m making it sound.",

Parkyns unveils the meaning of the woman clothed with the sun, the dragon making war, and other symbols in the chapter, showing the triumph of the Lord Jesus Christ over Satan intermingled with the suffering and persecution that goes on to the present hour.",

            "description": "There is great attack against those on the \"front lines\" in ministry. The devil is aiming all of his amunition toward those who \"love God and are the called according to His purpose.\" This is a message about the war with the principalities, a war that true Christian\u2019s fight each and every day.  This spiritual war was declared in the Garden of Eden but in these last days Satan is changing his plans.  Time is near and Satan knows that his time is short.  Since the cross, Satan has approached this spiritual warfare in a different way for those that are covered by the blood of Jesus Christ.",

In these last days, as we see the prophecies written in the Scripture come to pass, never in history have we had such a time as now.  This is a post 9\/11 sermon and very fitting for today.  All of these wars are nothing but battles, which are systematic wars in preparation for the war that is soon to come.",
