SPURGEON, AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON. \u201cHere is the patience of the salute: here are they that keep the commandments of God, and the faith of Jesus. And I heard a voice from heaven saying unto me, Write, Blessed are the dead which die in the Lord from henceforth: Yea, saith the Spirit, that they may rest from their labors, and their works do follow them.\u201d \u2014 Revelation 14:12, 13. THE text speaks of a voice from heaven which said, \u201cBlessed are the dead which die in the Lord.\u201d The witness of that voice is not needed upon every occasion, for even the commonest observer is compelled to feel concerning many of the righteous that their deaths are blessed. Balaam, with all his moral shortsightedness, could say, \u201cLet me die the death of the righteous, and let my last end be like his.\u201d That is the case when death comes in peaceful fashion. The man has lived a calm, godly, consistent life; he has lived as long as he could well have wished to live, and in dying he sees his children and his children's children gathered around his bed. What a fine picture the old man makes, as he sits up with that snowy head supported by snowy pillows. Hear him as he tells his children that goodness and mercy have followed him all the days of his life, and now he is going to dwell in the house of the Lord for ever...",
