There is only one kingdom that can never be shaken, and only one ark that will be spared in the sudden outpouring of God\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s righteous judgment. There is only one Bride for the Bridegroom; there is only one, called to the marriage supper of the Lamb.",

            "description": "December 4,2005 - There is no deeper and darker blindness than religious blindness. The theology of Babylon has no effect on its society but to dull and deaden the people. This theology of self seeking and animates false prophets who are covetous and has a heart that seeks prestige and power. This theology diminishes the poor and leads them into oppression and darkness. We escape the Babylon theology by considering the poor and needy and reaching out to them with the compassionate heart of Christ",
