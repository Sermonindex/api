            "description": "Here in Revelation is a court room like no other, there is a Judge, but no jury, no plea, no bargaining, no defense attorney, only judgement.  The great white throne mentioned here is great because of the Great Judge that sits upon it, He is the the Lord of lords and King of kings, the Lord Jesus Himself.  The throne is white because of the purity of Him who sits upon it who cannot even look upon sin His eyes are so holy. In this passage we hear of His face from whom everything, even the great expanse of the cosmos flees away, except for the unrepentent sinnner before Him.  Here at the great white throne everything will be revealed even down to the idle words they spoke, the fearful thing about this court room is that after the judgement there is only eternal Hell.\r\n\r\n[i]All material by Pastor Legge is copyrighted.

            "description": "A deeply moving wake-up call to the church, instructing her to live in the light of eternity, \"for we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ\" (2 Corinthians 5:10). Leonard Ravenhill describes the judgment day from Scripture as a court day  where the verdict is final. He first points to the judgment of the unjust and then focusses on the judgment of the righteous. He emphasizes that we will all stand before Jesus alone and will not only be judged for what we have done, but also for what we have not done that we should have done. He denounces the worldliness of the people of God who invest their time and money as the world does - thus building on wood, hay and stubble as opposed to silver, gold and precious stones. Leonard Ravenhill strongly opposes today's \"sloppy gospel\" and \"sloppy evangelism\"  of a love with no judgment. He warns that we are passing from the mercy of the lamb to the wrath of the lamb when Jesus judges the earth and mercy will be gone forever. As the work of every human being shall be tried in the fire, many public ministries will go down in ashes. Leonard describes 95 % of believers as bound by superstition and theology. He criticizes the unjust money-making of public ministries that leads to false investments of large amounts of money. He states that we must have Jesus take the government over our lives in reality and be lost and consumed in Him. Ravenhill closes his sermon with a strong call to repentance: \"If we cannot live as a different breed of people on this earth we have no right to live here. God stamp eternity on my eyeballs.\"",
