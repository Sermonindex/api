We cannot limit Jesus suffering to mere physical suffering, otherwise sin could be dealt with and atoned for with every human death, and that would be sufficient for entrance into heaven.  With a true understanding and acknowledgment of the spiritual and infinite sufferings of Christ should also come a truth which breaks us free from our love of sin.  If we only ever see God as a means to our physical need, then we are missing the point of the New Covenant entirely.
