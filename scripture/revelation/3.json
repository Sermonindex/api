He has been building a pure pristine Book of Acts fellowship in House Church networks all over rural China. There is a simplicity to the move of God yet such fervency, love, and desire born in the hearts of these believers. We need to break out of the simple 1 hour church meeting patterns, and start to serve the Lord with full commitment like many of these precious brothers and sisters in the Lord. For many of us the questions and truths that are revealed are very important for us to hear as we gather under the Headship of Jesus Christ in local areas.",

So then because thou art lukewarm, and neither cold nor hot, I will spue thee out of my mouth. Because thou sayest, I am rich, and increased with goods, and have need of nothing, and knowest not that thou art wretched, and miserable, and poor, and blind, and naked: I counsel thee to buy of me gold tried in the fire, that thou mayest be rich, and white raiment, that thou mayest be clothed, and that the shame of thy nakedness do not appear; and anoint thine eyes with eyesalve, that thou mayest see.

These are all good things but God's call for greatness is higher. If we don\u2019t have the love of God all these things count for nothing. We are called to put away childish things such as grievances, unforgiveness, envy, pride and anger and begin to love others like Jesus loves us. This is impossible to do without the power of the Holy Spirit. Christ in us gives us the power to go beyond human limitations into the supernatural love of God. The indisputable evidence of a great church is the love we have for one another. It is something of God working in us and through us.",

When we do this, we are separating ourselves from the Spirit of God and we are operating with our natural senses. God's spirit will not strive with man and He will not share His glory with anyone.

            "description": "This is a powerful message about the church of Laodicea and much of the Western church of this day.  The message is centered on the verses between Revelation 3:14 to 3:22  Carter also uses verses from Mark chapter 4 to show the disciples fearfulness and lack of concern for others when they were in storm with Jesus in the boat.  The church of Laodicea had the same lack of concern for others with the self-centered life that they were in.  In Isaiah chapter 58, the message speaks of the fast that God has chosen instead of the fasts of pretence that the people of that time were doing.  Like the church of Laodicea, the people of Isaiah\u2019s day were living life for themselves with no concern or grief for the poor or suffering.  With these verses the message went into a parallel with much of the church of today that looks for self-help books, or seminaries, or even counseling without seeking God or God\u2019s word for problems.  Carter encourages married people with problems to look to Ephesians chapter 5 for an answer to problems instead of the counsel of someone who suggests that all your problems are from your third and forth generation.  The message ends with words about revival using the revival of Ezra where it speaks of the people weeping. Revival has a strange mixture of weeping and joy.  In revival the hearts of the people are broken and there is remorse.  The church of Laodicea did not weep for others.",

When the Son of God knocks on the door of your heart to put what you know about Him into practice, how will you respond? We are called to take everything God has given to us and use it for the betterment of human suffering. This doesn't make sense to the natural man who will choose self preservation and stay locked behind a closed door fellowship. If you reach out to the widow and the hungry in a time of famine, the treasure of Jesus Christ will be unlocked to you. When we turn our hearts away from helping the poor and needy, we rob ourselves of the presence of God. Jesus stands at the door and knocks and if you will open the door He will give you provision to feed the hungry, clothe the naked and touch the heart of a sin-sick world. Let your heart come into agreement with what God speaks for your life. If you have resisted this call Jesus is willing to knock again.",
