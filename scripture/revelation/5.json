When we behold the ebullient wonder of what God has made, \u201cwe ought to stop thinking like a scientist and start thinking like a psalmist. \u2026 Let us not think anymore of God as being heavy browed and gloomy! I repeat that when God made the heaven and earth, they sang together and all the sons of God shouted for joy! There wasn\u2019t a funeral at the creation of the world; there was an anthem, and all the creature creations sang! And at the incarnation they sang!\u201d There was singing at the resurrection and we\u2019ll sing at the rapture and the consummation, and the song will be \u201cWorthy is the Lamb!\u201d The message is firmly grounded in 1 John 4:12-16, John 17:20-23, and Revelation 5:9-11.

Four different times during this chapter the Lord opens his eyes to see new additions to the scene. John watches as the amazing inauguration of \u201cthe Lamb\u201d unfolds. The magnitude of this event cannot be overstated: God is handing over the execution of His eternal plan to His Son. Although its significance is typically lost on man, the angelic beings present understand it and lead all creation in a symphony of praise.",
