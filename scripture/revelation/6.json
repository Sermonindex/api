            "description": "The vast majority of evangelicals hold a pre-tribulation, pre-millennial perspective of the Second Coming. This dispensational understanding has largely shaped the minds of modern believers (i.e. The Left Behind series) regarding the End Times. Before proceeding into the momentous events described in Revelation 6, Pastor Steve felt that an objective examination of the main theories regarding the Second Coming of Christ was necessary. His personal conclusions about the future are thought provoking and possibly even fascinating.",

He sought for God's honor with the zeal of Elijah and mourned with Jeremiah at the apostasy of God's people. \r\n\r\nLeonard Ravenhill was a close friend of pastor and writer A. W. Tozer and spoke of him as one of the most influential voices in the Church in America. A.W. Tozer's materials are a mainstay in Evangelical churches in our day and he is one of the most quoted authors. He was a prophet in his day and his writings are even more influential in our day.
