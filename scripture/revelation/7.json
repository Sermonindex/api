In the same way the Blood of Christ cleanses us from all unrighteousness to counter any poison of sin that enters. The blood is like petrol that allows your body to function. The other members of the body remains in its place, but the blood is present right through your body. The blood also carries oxygen throughout your body. It also gets rid of impurities and acts like a refuse remover. We speak so glibly about the Blood of Christ, little realising what it does. It brings us life and that's why the devil hates it.",
