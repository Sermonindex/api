            "description": "This passage in Romans is often misinterpretted by many in the church today, to mean that to recieved the gift of the Spirit is the same as being filled with the Spirit, which it is not.  Pastor Maxwell shows how in many cases in the scriptures the filling of the Holy Spirit was subsequent to the recieving of the Spirit.  He shows that the prescence of the Spirit is not the smae as the presiding of the Spirit, this is how the Holy Spirit can be present in us but we are not allowing Him to rule over over us.",
