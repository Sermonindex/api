He starts by taking us through Romans 8:33-39 to underscore the bold exhortation of 1 Peter 3:13. Nothing can harm a good man! \u201cNothing can debase his quality, nothing can reduce his dimensions, nothing can prevent the fulfillment of his destiny, nothing can block the accomplishment of his appointed task, and nothing can lower his value before God and the universe!\u201d With this May 16, 1954 sermon, Pastor Tozer marked one year from the beginning of his 34-part series on Peter\u2019s first epistle. \u201cWho is He That Will Harm You?\u201d is the 27th message, preached at Southside Alliance Church in Chicago, Illinois. It is 38 minutes, 43 seconds in length.",

Come and rejoice in a loving Saviour who was willing to drink the cup of God's wrath in our place and be crushed for our transgressions. Learn how only God's perfect Son could satisfy the Father's need for justice. A most powerful and enlightening sermon.",

In Hebrews 11:6 we read that without faith it is impossible to please God for he who comes to God must believe that He is and He rewards those that truly seek Him.  The men and women that God uses believe in His promises and stand in faith upon those promises.  Paul reminds us in the Epistle to Romans that it is God who gives us a measure of faith (Romans 12:3).  The men and women that God uses are people of faith.",

This message is about the latter, those who cause sedition. God appoints leaders. Insubordination is mutiny against God. Sermon outline: 1. The Danger of Sedition. 2. The Blessing of being under Authority.  3. Proper Servant-Leadership.",

Above every human help we recognize the Lord\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hand in this volume from the start to finish. The messages in this book were birthed out of a genuine burden2 of the Lord and we pray this burden has been conveyed with as little interference from the human vessels3 as possible.",

Some of the earliest hymns in the Church were chants or Scriptural truths read aloud in unison. To verbally proclaim in unison holy truths of God will have a great affect spiritually on the Assembly of believers to strengthen and unify them in the faith once delivered to the saints.1148\r\nWe are commended in the Scriptures to verbally proclaim our allegiance to the Son of God, confessing truths that we believe in our heart.1149 Though modern day evangelicalism is mostly non-liturgical this was not so in the early days of Christianity.",

            "description": "This message starts with a brief summary of what Mr Washer preached earlier in the week. Then, after exhorting fathers in the fulfilling of their Biblical responsibilities, he turns to Romans 12:1-2 where the apostle Paul urges us to give our lives away; not for a cause, but to a Person. Our motivation for doing so is \u2018the mercies of God\u2019, which Mr Washer then explains. This laying down of one\u2019s life is a once-and-for-all decision; but why does Paul say, Present your bodies? For one thing, it destroys the notion that a man can outwardly live in ungodliness whilst claiming that in his heart he really loves Jesus Christ. Furthermore, the things we do in our bodies are evidence of our sanctification and dedication to God. Mr Washer also examines in some detail what we put in to our bodies, revealing our responsibilities before God and men. He then considers in turn our eyes, ears, tongue, hands and feet, and how we clothe our bodies; he pleads with us to do all things to the glory of God.  (46 minutes).",

            "description": "Part 2 opens with one more example of presenting our bodies a living sacrifice: the dangers of dating. This is so rarely taught that something has to be said from a Biblical basis. Parents are not teaching their children their responsibilities, and the church is not showing the parents how. Biblical counsel is this: don\u2019t put yourself in the way of temptation. This issue is not a question of the intellect, it\u2019s a question of the will: we know what\u2019s right, we just don\u2019t want to do it. Proceeding into v.2,  Mr Washer explains what it means to be not conformed to this world, both for individuals and for the church. He explains that the renewing of the mind is a total transformation, a supernatural creative work of God. He then examines the will of God, and how you will know it by its characteristics of being good, acceptable and perfect. This message outlines practical issues that we all have to deal with. Believing the doctrine is one thing; but is it a growing, practical reality in your life? If not, stop and deal with it, one step at a time.  (43 minutes)",

The spirit of apathy could, according to a leading scholar, be the very thing that brings our society and that the epitaph of our society will be \"This society died because it just couldn't be bothered\". This spirit is seeping into the church and we see the contrast between it and that man of God the Apostle Paul. He shows how we will not be able to win souls until we have wept for souls and our own apathy has been nailed to the Cross.\r\n\r\n[i]All material by Pastor Legge is copyrighted.

We must understand that the gospel is unbelievable, and is scandalous; if we remove the scandal, we remove the power.

It begins, 'Brethren, my heart's desire and prayer to God for Israel is, that they might be saved.' If you really desire that men should be saved, pray for them. It is an empty wish, a mere formality, if you do not turn it into prayer. Every loving desire for any man or woman should, by the believer, be taken before God in prayer. We cannot expect that God will save men unless his people pray for it. There must be travail before the birth, and there must be travail in prayer with God before we can expect that many will be born again into the church of God. Oh, for more prayer! Let us cry to God in secret, and in the family, and in all our assemblies, that God would save the sons of men. But prayer, if it is sincere, is always attended with effort. Hence the apostle begins to teach as well as to pray. He prays that Israel might be saved, and then he explains the difficulties in the way, and tries to remove them. You pray, dear friend, do you? But you never speak to the individual for whom you pray. Is your prayer sincere? I will not question it. But...",

            "description": "All men, even Christians, are so influenced by the culture we live in, that we say and do many things that are not Biblical, without even realising it. Paul Washer begins his exhortations by dealing with the speculations (AV = \u2018imaginations\u2019) which must be cast down if we are to fulfil our calling to be a biblical people. He focuses on the roles of men in particular, both in their families and their local churches, which he shows to be the two hardest places to live out a Biblical manhood. Most problems in those two areas, he says, can be traced back to men not standing on truth and not acting Biblically. Working through specific examples, he shows how the speculations of men actually fight against God, and also shows how such things should be put right. He then focuses in some detail on marriage, using Romans 8:28. Once a man discovers the true purpose of marriage, and learns what it means to love his wife as Christ loves the church, he will find both joy and rest in putting an end to his former speculations about the nature of marriage.

Once we have been prepared to dwell in that fire, and for that fire to dwell in us, we can then go out and minister to lost mankind, bringing that fire and that life to people \u2013 it will flow out of us and bring life and light. Dr. Thompson says that is our eternal purpose in Christ \u2013 to be priests of God in His Kingdom forever. He discusses the unique unity that Adam and Eve shared, and the similarities with the unity that Christ and the Church are to have.

            "description": "Dr. Thompson says that Romans 8:1 is conditional \u2013 that we are without condemnation IF we are not living after the sinful nature, but after the Spirit. He says there are only two ways to live, two ways that you can approach any decision or action \u2013 either in the flesh or in the spirit. If you don\u2019t live after the Spirit, you are still under condemnation. He discusses the difference between \u201cthe pursuit of happiness\u201d and \u201cthe pursuit of righteousness.\u201d He says the key to \"living in the Spirit\" can be found in Proverbs 3:5-6, \u201cIn all your ways acknowledge Him\u2026\u201d Dr. Thompson finishes by discussing some \"big picture\" elements, such as, why God created man as a response to the rebellion of the angels. Excellent sermon, very practical.",

Dr. Orr discusses how he believed that Satan was the main hindrance to people understanding revival, and though he was a revival scholar, his intent was not to increase knowledge on the subject for the sake of increasing knowledge, but rather to increase knowledge of revival to enable people to be subjects of revival. He also talks about areas of the world where he believed revival was currently happening, along with some of the mistakes that people have made after revival has occurred.  \"I shudder to hear of people who claim to be filled with the Holy Spirit without any holiness of life.\" Dr. Orr talks about how after years of revival work he kept himself renewed. \"Evan Roberts once said to me 'always pray for a vision to match your faith'.\"",

And that presence will produce in a hungry soul an ever increasing revelation of who Christ is. This is often revealed in us and to us through suffering and trials. We have this great kingdom which cannot be moved, such great victory, and power living in us. Pastor Conlon goes through many other scriptures revealing how the Lord Jesus Christ is our Treasure. The person drawing closer to Him, cannot help being awed by Him, and at the same time painfully aware of their own sinful flesh in comparison. If your heart is toward Christ he knows, and he will not let the enemy overwhelm you as you trust in him. Pursuit of an ever increasing knowledge and intimacy with Christ should be the Christian's number one priority. When we get careless with the word of God and prayer, tragedy can come. The devil is always after the treasure of the presence of Christ in your life. Pastor Conlon warns: There is no greater danger than to become careless with this Book!",

I wonder what they had to tell, because there were other angels up there waiting and wondering what in the world happened when Jesus Christ the Son of God came among men.  What happened?  Oh, I think there must have been real sadness in heaven.  \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Why, they were all asleep\u00e2\u20ac\u201dthe whole city of the King.  They were all asleep.  We couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t even wake them up with our trumpets.  We had to go out into the field where the shepherds were watching.  They were awake.  They were awake\u00e2\u20ac\u201dthey heard us.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d I heard an Alliance preacher say that angels don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t sing.  I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know.  All our songs talk about angels singing.  But the Bible doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t say that.  They talked; they had a message\u00e2\u20ac\u201da very wonderful message, but nobody there to listen to it, nobody there to be interested.  \u00e2\u20ac\u0153He came unto His own\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6\u00e2\u20ac\u009d\u00e2\u20ac\u201dwhat a fact; how very wonderful: this entire Old Testament was a preparation for the coming of the King to this earth, and was intended to prepare hearts to be ready to receive Him.  But when He came, there was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153no form nor comliness that we should desire Him.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d  My goodness, who in the world would have looked for Him in a manger\u00e2\u20ac\u201din a manager in a stable?",

However due to a vow to Saint Barbara, patron saint of miners, he became a monk and applied his legal mind to theology, he saw the Lord as righteous Judge of the whole creation and thus was zealous to live a holy life.  In 1510 he went to Rome, as he was disillusioned with the way the church was in Germany, there he became even more concerned and left declaring that the city was built over Hell itself! He returned to Germany where he became a Bible teacher it was here in preparing for a lesson one day that he read Psalm 31:1 and later Romans 1:17 and realised by faith man can not only be deemed 'not guilty' but actually be seen as righteous before a perfect God.",

THIS is placed in connection with a large number of brief but very weighty precepts. Prayer has a distinct relationship to all Christian duties and graces. It is not possible for us to carry out the holy commands of our Lord Jesus unless we are abundant in supplication. The Romans at the time that Paul wrote to them were subject to persecution, and in this verse he mentions two remedies for impatience under such afflictions, remedies which are equally effectual under all the trials of life. The old physicians tell us of two antidotes against poison, the hot and the cold, and they dilate upon the special excellence of each of these: in like manner the apostle Paul gives us first the warm antidote - \u201cRejoicing in hope,\u201d and then he gives us the cool antidote, \u201cPatient in tribulation.\u201d Either of these, or both together, will work wonderfully for the sustaining of the spirit in the hour of affliction; but it is to be observed, that neither of these remedies can be taken into the soul except they be mixed with a draught of prayer. Joy and patience are curative essences, but they must be dropped into a glass full of supplication, and then they will be wonderfully efficient. How can we \u201crejoice in hope\u201d if we know nothing about prayer to the God of hope.",

Often times it may well just be one area that remains but nonetheless folks continue in that sin.  Wilkerson preaches a very personal message here and he shares his heart and shows his own weakness as an example.  The consequences for a Christian continuing in sin are sobering, but he gave us what we needed to overcome sin, if we want to. For those who are sick of their sin, and hate it, and cry out to God, there is wonderful news. He will empower you, and he wants to put his fear in your heart so you will not turn away from him, and then he can take you into the fullness of the new covenant.

All existing life exists as a result of information, organized information.  Statistical analysts understand that information does not arise by chance.  AE Wilder-Smith shows in this discussion how to understand information theory, and how it proves creationism to be the only logical viewpoint.  Matter is not self-organizing; it is merely a medium for information.   Smith discusses the classic debate between Bishop Wilberforce and Aldous Huxley concerning the watch-maker.  He shows the fallacy of Huxley\u2019s argument.  If you are not familiar with this debate it is a rather essential understanding in order to unravel the Gordian-Knot of evolution theory.  Smith argues in this teaching how important creationism understandings are because man is accountable to God upon the basis of God being revealed through nature.",

The sermon preached to Paul wasn't like so many of today's sermons, where people are told that they should come to Jesus to be happy, joyful, blessed, rich etc. That's why so many fall away. Of course those things could be added but that's not the reason you come to God neither the reason God saves you. God saves you that you might know Him and do His will, wherever He might lead. Someone asked one of the co-workers why he wasn't preaching a Gospel of love, blessedness and material prosperity. He answered that we preach the love of God as revealed in His Son Jesus who suffered and died for us on the cross because of our sin. He died so that we can be saved, do His will and lay down our lives for our fellowmen so that they too can be saved. The man then broke down and answered that he realizes for the first time that he has never been saved, but only followed after other men.",

In Acts 5 we read of Ananias and Sapphira who died when they lied to the Holy Spirit. In 1Cor 10:8-11 Paul relates how the children of Israel were judged and killed when they committed fornication, murmured and tempted Christ. And these things happened to them as examples to us, so that we would be admonished not to do the same. If we therefore think of ourselves, the fact that we are still alive is only because of His mercy. God is gracious to you but if you carry on in sin you will be destroyed.",

He lovingly explains about the warfare we have to fight our way through to pray, and reveals even if we have neglected to pray as we should, God still wants us to come to him, and he will by the Holy Ghost teach us how to pray as we should. For that alone is how we learn. So stop beating yourself up and get alone with the Holy Spirit and ask him to teach you to pray.",

In Hebrews 2, Jesus says that He isn't ashamed to call us His brethren. (We say it with utter respect and only because Jesus said it first). We are even called heirs to His Kingdom. As an heir you stand in line for an inheritance. Our life must be different if we truly comprehend this fact. Woe to you if you don't wake up, do His will and live the life He expects from you.",

Instead, we have turned away from listening to God and His word into paths of unrighteousness. One of the most aggravated sins of moral degeneracy of our nation is that of the unrequited blood of murdered multitudes. Our nation is stained with an ocean of blood that cries to God for His vengeance. In this opening up of God's Word to our nation, we hear God's rebuke and denunciation for our nation's aggravated sins and a call to repentance and prayer.",

Sadly these days, our Nation is marked not only by an unrestrained and unashamed abandonment to sensuality but also by the putrid sin of sexual perversion. What is called sexual orientation and an alternative lifestyle today, God has always called an abomination, which he visits with severe judgment but from which he offers salvation.  In this message from God's Word to our Nation, we hear God's rebuke and denunciation for our nation's aggravated moral sins and a call to repentance and prayer. There is cleansing in the blood of Christ for all of our sexual sins. 1 Corinthians 6:9-11",

The question is: \u201cIs it too late?\u201d Are we desperate enough to hold on to God and plead, \u201cWilt thou not revive us again?\u201d Are we impatient or importunate? Do we wish for revival or do we will it? The hour is late, but God's mercy is great!",

The reason is simply because if we do not, we will be contradicting and removing from the heart of God and His prophets, the very thing that was central to Him! This was the agony as well as the ecstasy of the apostle Paul in his epistle to the Romans. He tells us that if we are ignorant of this mystery, we are in danger of becoming wise in our own conceit. In this deeply-sobering and enlightening message, Art Katz shares on the mystery and the relationship the Church has with the Jews and how we are called to be agents of Israel's restoration!",

Daniel was God\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s prophet during the period of Babylonian captivity. The Gentiles thought they were so mighty and powerful. Their despotic rulers and emperors thought they were independent of the God of heaven. The wicked nations thought that their kings had the ultimate and final authority. The kings and the princes of the Gentile world positioned themselves as if they were unpunishable. The prophecy here is a revelation from heaven that God, Who created the earth and all the inhabitants therein, has not abandoned the world to His creatures. This revelation upholds the truth known to patriarchs and prophets from the earliest of times that God is Judge. The God of heaven is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153the Judge of all the earth\u00e2\u20ac\u009d (Genesis 18:25).",

This passage of Scripture consumed David for months and he studied it from every angle.  This is absolutely the best sermon on this topic of righteousness that I have heard, separating real righteousness from much of the emotional righteousness that many seem to subscribe to this day. Jesus said you would know the truth and the truth shall set you free. Sanctification is the Spirit of Christ in us making us to become what God in reality sees you to be already, by faith. Making us what we could never be on our own, holy. The gift of righteousness is the Spirit of Christ in you. When you yield to him and let him have control, he makes you what he is. The Lord doesn't want you to come to him in condemnation and guilt. He wants the truth of his righteousness and his love to set you free.",

For therein is the righteousness of God revealed from faith to faith: as it is written. The just shall live by faith.\" (Romans 1:16-17) The Gospel which saves us is the power of God and the wisdom of God; for no one was saved by their own power, nor their own wisdom, but by the working alone of God's mighty power. The greatest need of man is righteousness with God, but it is also his greatest impossibility. Only through the Gospel is that righteousness secured, not by the strength and will of the flesh, but by the power and wisdom and God.",

We must come to the Lord with a WHOLE heart - and not TRY Him, but SERVE Him, because He is GOD. Many do not get through to God because they are seeking their own agenda, or their own personal well being rather than the purpose of Christ. The reason so many walk in confusion is because of this refusal to submit to God. Why do Christians not pray as they should? Are they not totally surrendered to following Jesus? Do they not understand the heart of God and his love for them? This unjust judge had authority in Luke 18 over this widow woman's adversary, and she knew her rights, and she did not give up. The devil accuses us, pointing out our faults, and God avenges us by giving us the very thing we lack, when we seek him for it. God delights in his children and will rise up to deliver them when they are under attack.  Another wonderful encouragement to prayer.",

After the captivity in Babylon, many of Israel had grown comfortable and stayed, rather than returning. Mixture in the world gives the enemy room to rise up and rule over you. Esther fasted and prayed, but she then had to get up and go to the king. We, as the Body of Christ, need to remember we are ambassadors of Christ, and there is no time for games. Jesus is coming, and we need to come out from among the world, and seperate ourselves for his purposes. If you are struggling with your flesh, this message will help you, and hopefully motivate you. Esther risked her life to intercede for her people. We need to risk whatever will come into our lives whether persecution, or trouble, to be seperated to God's purposes.",

God has a controversy when the nations of this world mistreat His Son's Body. Sinners and hypocrites in Zion will be afraid when God begins to move and shake things. They won't be prepared for there is no security unless you are IN CHRIST. Unless your life is hid in Him, and you are dead to this world and it's vain attractions.

There is so much misunderstanding and confusion that surrounds the issue of election, and my hope is that this message will clear much of that away. The Church must not be ashamed of, or apologize for, God, and one of the greatest hindrances to our coming into the fullness of the stature of Christ is our failure to embrace this essential God glorifying truth: that salvation is all of God and not of man.",

First the dominion of sin is the guilt of sin which is the same as the power of sin, sin has power over us when we feel the guilt that comes with it, and the passage of time does nothing to releave the power of sin over us to make us feel condemned.  Secondly to be under the Law means that we are trying to please God by trying to keep the moral Law which cannot be done thus the law is the power of sin, as we try and keep the law and fail the guilt , or power, of sin increases on us, we thus end up feeling so condemned that we think that bit of extra sin cannot make a bad situation worse.  Thirdly though despite all this we are under grace, not the dominion of sin, neither the law but grace!  The grace of God is shown in that even though we deserve Hell He gives us love and mercy.  Finally to reckon ourselves dead to sin means to realise sin has no more power to condemn us because of the work of the Lord Jesus on the cross of calvary.",

The power of sin over the christian, or anyone, is it's ability to condemn and maintain our guilt before the law of God, we can go on for years under the power of a sin that we may only have commited once, this is the sanre designed by Satan himself and the more we try and work our way free the tighter it becomes and the more condemned we feel trying to live up to the law in order to please God.  But praise God for the Lord Jesus who took upon Himself the wieght of sin and not only that but became my sin and yours for us, He alone could have exhausted the power of sin and the law over us and so He alone can free us from it's grasp.",

Some worldly philosophers define conscience as the culmination of all the good behaviors learned over childhood from parents. But the Scriptures talk about conscience as being from God. Paul speaks of it by name in Romans 2:15 and Romans 9:1. And, as Dr. Tozer points out in this message, the voice of the conscience is always on God's side, never the world's.",

He was first considered a heretic for peaching an unfamiliar (actually, forgotten) doctrine, but it marked the beginning of the reformation of the church. Has justification by faith now overshadowed other truths, like the inevitability of God's judgment? Dr. Tozer explores this possibility and reaches some disturbing conclusions.",

God's wrath is as much a divine perfection as His love, and therefore it is something marvelous for us to rejoice in.",

Although all can recall wrongdoing, the Law has been given to convict us of sin -- to show the enormity of our crime against a holy, just, and righteous God. Until we are convicted of our crime and cry out to be free, the Gospel of salvation holds no real meaning. Unfortunately, most preaching over the last 100 years has not started with the Law but has instead been offering a Gospel to people who are really unaware from what they must be saved. The Holy Spirit has thus been stripped of \"the only tool He has ever used to prepare men for Grace.\" The Law was never intended for Salvation, but to reveal the character of both God and man and to point to man's need of Christ.

            "description": "Paul Washer uses examples from within his own denomination to reveal what is true of so many places that call themselves churches, with regard to (1) the ways in which Biblical and historical Christianity has been reduced to an impotent and empty creed, and (2) the effects of this reduction upon the people who are influenced by it. But whilst casting down false strongholds, he is also faithful to build up that which is true, clearly setting out what is the TRUE gospel of Christ, of which the Apostle was not ashamed. When that gospel is preached, we should be asking men, not \u201cDo you know you\u2019re a sinner?\u201d but \u201cHas God so worked in your heart that the sin you once loved you now hate?\u201d; not \u201cHave you made a decision?\u201d but \u201cHas God worked in your heart?\u201d; not \u201cDo you want to go to heaven?\u201d but \u201dHas God so worked in your heart that you now esteem him worthy above all things, and desire HIM?\u201d. Mr Washer includes examples of some Godly conversions, which clearly bear the fruits of  that miraculous and supernatural repentance and regeneration which are the work of God alone. (50 minutes).",

So also we must recognize that, being made as \u201cgods\u201d (John 10:34) we were given the free will to choose our present condition.  God is not to be blamed for the suffering we have chosen, neither is He to be blamed for the wreckage as a result of it.  Just as our Lord was, so also we need to be perfected through sufferings.  Suffering offers mankind the option to change.  We were cast out of eternity into time so that our decision could be corrected, and Jesus came and suffered for us so that we could be reconciled.",

Few people know, with real, unshakeable certainty, that everything is working together for good. If you don\u2019t believe it, you probably have the wrong definition of good. Are you discontented? Are you shaken by adversities, or the removal of blessings and comforts? Mr Washer uses these verses to reveal the causes and the remedy. God has made us sons and daughters, a high calling indeed; yet whilst we certainly benefit, the prime beneficiary is God\u2019s son. God is making brothers and sisters for his son, a fellowship of those who stand in awe of their elder brother and worship him; and we can only worship him truly if we are conformed to his image. We have to be made like him to know how worthy he is; and the more we know him, the more we will be drawn to worship him. Is God\u2019s ultimate purpose your purpose? Is your eye single in this respect? If not, Mr Washer explains what you should do.  (29 minutes)",
