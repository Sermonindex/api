After introductory exhortations to up-coming preachers and evangelists, Paul Washer sets out to highlight some of the errors destroying modern-day evangelism. He also explains what should be preached, and how, and likens labouring with souls to the travails of birth. We must understand that the gospel is unbelievable, and is scandalous; if we remove the scandal, we remove the power. This world is ripe for a move of God: What a time to be alive!!, he exclaims (67 minutes).",

            "description": "Martin Luther was born in Germany to a poor mining family, Luther though excelled at school and studied law at university, he was set to be one of the top legal minds in Europe.  However due to a vow to Saint Barbara, patron saint of miners, he became a monk and applied his legal mind to theology, he saw the Lord as righteous Judge of the whole creation and thus was zealous to live a holy life.  In 1510 he went to Rome, as he was disillusioned with the way the church was in Germany, there he became even more concerned and left declaring that the city was built over Hell itself! He returned to Germany where he became a Bible teacher it was here in preparing for a lesson one day that he read Psalm 31:1 and later Romans 1:17 and realised by faith man can not only be deemed 'not guilty' but actually be seen as righteous before a perfect God.",

            "description": "In the debate between creation vs. evolution, the fundamental nail in evolution theories coffin is the field of study known as information science.  All existing life exists as a result of information, organized information.  Statistical analysts understand that information does not arise by chance.  AE Wilder-Smith shows in this discussion how to understand information theory, and how it proves creationism to be the only logical viewpoint.  Matter is not self-organizing; it is merely a medium for information.   Smith discusses the classic debate between Bishop Wilberforce and Aldous Huxley concerning the watch-maker.  He shows the fallacy of Huxley\u2019s argument.  If you are not familiar with this debate it is a rather essential understanding in order to unravel the Gordian-Knot of evolution theory.  Smith argues in this teaching how important creationism understandings are because man is accountable to God upon the basis of God being revealed through nature.",

Sadly these days, our Nation is marked not only by an unrestrained and unashamed abandonment to sensuality but also by the putrid sin of sexual perversion. What is called sexual orientation and an alternative lifestyle today, God has always called an abomination, which he visits with severe judgment but from which he offers salvation.  In this message from God's Word to our Nation, we hear God's rebuke and denunciation for our nation's aggravated moral sins and a call to repentance and prayer. There is cleansing in the blood of Christ for all of our sexual sins. 1 Corinthians 6:9-11",

For therein is the righteousness of God revealed from faith to faith: as it is written. The just shall live by faith.\" (Romans 1:16-17) The Gospel which saves us is the power of God and the wisdom of God; for no one was saved by their own power, nor their own wisdom, but by the working alone of God's mighty power. The greatest need of man is righteousness with God, but it is also his greatest impossibility. Only through the Gospel is that righteousness secured, not by the strength and will of the flesh, but by the power and wisdom and God.",

God's wrath is as much a divine perfection as His love, and therefore it is something marvelous for us to rejoice in.",

But whilst casting down false strongholds, he is also faithful to build up that which is true, clearly setting out what is the TRUE gospel of Christ, of which the Apostle was not ashamed. When that gospel is preached, we should be asking men, not \u201cDo you know you\u2019re a sinner?\u201d but \u201cHas God so worked in your heart that the sin you once loved you now hate?\u201d; not \u201cHave you made a decision?\u201d but \u201cHas God worked in your heart?\u201d; not \u201cDo you want to go to heaven?\u201d but \u201dHas God so worked in your heart that you now esteem him worthy above all things, and desire HIM?\u201d. Mr Washer includes examples of some Godly conversions, which clearly bear the fruits of  that miraculous and supernatural repentance and regeneration which are the work of God alone. (50 minutes).",
