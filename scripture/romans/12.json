The men and women that God uses believe in His promises and stand in faith upon those promises.  Paul reminds us in the Epistle to Romans that it is God who gives us a measure of faith (Romans 12:3).  The men and women that God uses are people of faith.",

            "description": "This message starts with a brief summary of what Mr Washer preached earlier in the week. Then, after exhorting fathers in the fulfilling of their Biblical responsibilities, he turns to Romans 12:1-2 where the apostle Paul urges us to give our lives away; not for a cause, but to a Person. Our motivation for doing so is \u2018the mercies of God\u2019, which Mr Washer then explains. This laying down of one\u2019s life is a once-and-for-all decision; but why does Paul say, Present your bodies? For one thing, it destroys the notion that a man can outwardly live in ungodliness whilst claiming that in his heart he really loves Jesus Christ. Furthermore, the things we do in our bodies are evidence of our sanctification and dedication to God. Mr Washer also examines in some detail what we put in to our bodies, revealing our responsibilities before God and men. He then considers in turn our eyes, ears, tongue, hands and feet, and how we clothe our bodies; he pleads with us to do all things to the glory of God.  (46 minutes).",

            "description": "Part 2 opens with one more example of presenting our bodies a living sacrifice: the dangers of dating. This is so rarely taught that something has to be said from a Biblical basis. Parents are not teaching their children their responsibilities, and the church is not showing the parents how. Biblical counsel is this: don\u2019t put yourself in the way of temptation. This issue is not a question of the intellect, it\u2019s a question of the will: we know what\u2019s right, we just don\u2019t want to do it. Proceeding into v.2,  Mr Washer explains what it means to be not conformed to this world, both for individuals and for the church. He explains that the renewing of the mind is a total transformation, a supernatural creative work of God. He then examines the will of God, and how you will know it by its characteristics of being good, acceptable and perfect. This message outlines practical issues that we all have to deal with. Believing the doctrine is one thing; but is it a growing, practical reality in your life? If not, stop and deal with it, one step at a time.  (43 minutes)",

He also talks about areas of the world where he believed revival was currently happening, along with some of the mistakes that people have made after revival has occurred.  \"I shudder to hear of people who claim to be filled with the Holy Spirit without any holiness of life.\" Dr. Orr talks about how after years of revival work he kept himself renewed. \"Evan Roberts once said to me 'always pray for a vision to match your faith'.\"",

THIS is placed in connection with a large number of brief but very weighty precepts. Prayer has a distinct relationship to all Christian duties and graces. It is not possible for us to carry out the holy commands of our Lord Jesus unless we are abundant in supplication. The Romans at the time that Paul wrote to them were subject to persecution, and in this verse he mentions two remedies for impatience under such afflictions, remedies which are equally effectual under all the trials of life. The old physicians tell us of two antidotes against poison, the hot and the cold, and they dilate upon the special excellence of each of these: in like manner the apostle Paul gives us first the warm antidote - \u201cRejoicing in hope,\u201d and then he gives us the cool antidote, \u201cPatient in tribulation.\u201d Either of these, or both together, will work wonderfully for the sustaining of the spirit in the hour of affliction; but it is to be observed, that neither of these remedies can be taken into the soul except they be mixed with a draught of prayer. Joy and patience are curative essences, but they must be dropped into a glass full of supplication, and then they will be wonderfully efficient. How can we \u201crejoice in hope\u201d if we know nothing about prayer to the God of hope.",

In Acts 5 we read of Ananias and Sapphira who died when they lied to the Holy Spirit. In 1Cor 10:8-11 Paul relates how the children of Israel were judged and killed when they committed fornication, murmured and tempted Christ. And these things happened to them as examples to us, so that we would be admonished not to do the same. If we therefore think of ourselves, the fact that we are still alive is only because of His mercy. God is gracious to you but if you carry on in sin you will be destroyed.",
