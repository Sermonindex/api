He was born in Newtownards, County Down, Ireland in 1911. In his book Tramp after God, he tells of living for more than three years as a tramp abusing alcohol and involved in crime. Willie Mullan had a religious conversion and from that time forward he decided he would strive to serve God.\r\n\r\n In 1953 Willie Mullan was called to Lurgan Baptist church, and in August of that year he commenced the work in Lurgan. One of his great accomplishments during this time was the Tuesday night Bible class. Every Tuesday night hundreds attended to hear the exposition of the Word. In 1957 William Hewitt and a team of helpers commenced the tape recordings of the Bible class. At least 1500 of these recordings remain until this day.",

Daniel was God\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s prophet during the period of Babylonian captivity. The Gentiles thought they were so mighty and powerful. Their despotic rulers and emperors thought they were independent of the God of heaven. The wicked nations thought that their kings had the ultimate and final authority. The kings and the princes of the Gentile world positioned themselves as if they were unpunishable. The prophecy here is a revelation from heaven that God, Who created the earth and all the inhabitants therein, has not abandoned the world to His creatures. This revelation upholds the truth known to patriarchs and prophets from the earliest of times that God is Judge.

            "description": "According to Dr. Tozer, Christians have a tendency to hold fast to one truth at the expense of another. Then, after a time, someone comes along and preaches the forgotten Truth -- as Martin Luther did with the doctrine of justification by faith. He was first considered a heretic for peaching an unfamiliar (actually, forgotten) doctrine, but it marked the beginning of the reformation of the church. Has justification by faith now overshadowed other truths, like the inevitability of God's judgment? Dr. Tozer explores this possibility and reaches some disturbing conclusions.",
