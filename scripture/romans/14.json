He has redeemed us with His precious blood and therefore we are not our own.272 This is a liberating truth if we can realize that all we do is in the clear view of God and therefore seek His approval alone. The early Church walked in the fear of the Lord273 and did not seek the accolades and esteem of men. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Then the Church throughout Judea, Galilee and Samaria enjoyed a time of peace and was strengthened. Living in the fear of the Lord and encouraged by the Holy Spirit, it increased in numbers.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d",

He discusses the parable of the sower, and the different types of ground. He covers very practical ways to tell how you are doing in Christ today. He ties the parable of the sower in with the fruit of the spirit. A very entertaining, informative and practical sermon.",

It is the sublime prophecy of God\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s authority as Judge \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the Judge of all the earth, and the revelation of the supreme royal position of Christ, the Messiah. Daniel was God\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s prophet during the period of Babylonian captivity. The Gentiles thought they were so mighty and powerful. Their despotic rulers and emperors thought they were independent of the God of heaven. The wicked nations thought that their kings had the ultimate and final authority. The kings and the princes of the Gentile world positioned themselves as if they were unpunishable. The prophecy here is a revelation from heaven that God, Who created the earth and all the inhabitants therein, has not abandoned the world to His creatures. This revelation upholds the truth known to patriarchs and prophets from the earliest of times that God is Judge. The God of heaven is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153the Judge of all the earth\u00e2\u20ac\u009d (Genesis 18:25).",

Then, after a time, someone comes along and preaches the forgotten Truth -- as Martin Luther did with the doctrine of justification by faith. He was first considered a heretic for peaching an unfamiliar (actually, forgotten) doctrine, but it marked the beginning of the reformation of the church. Has justification by faith now overshadowed other truths, like the inevitability of God's judgment? Dr. Tozer explores this possibility and reaches some disturbing conclusions.",
