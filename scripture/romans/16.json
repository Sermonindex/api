The names of those who have had a part in this volume are too numerous to mention. To all those who labored in editing, revising, suggesting and offering your counsel we are indebted. Above every human help we recognize the Lord\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hand in this volume from the start to finish. The messages in this book were birthed out of a genuine burden2 of the Lord and we pray this burden has been conveyed with as little interference from the human vessels3 as possible.",
