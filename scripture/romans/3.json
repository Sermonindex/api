I came to Christ at a Billy Graham Los Angeles Crusade in the 1960's. While completing my Bachelor of Science degree in Business Administration at Cal Poly Pomona, I sensed the call of God on my life to follow Jesus Christ completely and possibly forget business and prepare for the ministry.. Soon after that I met Alan Redpath who invited me and my wife Jean to England, where we attended Capernwray Bible School. Upon returning to the United States, I continued my studies at Talbot Seminary in La Mirada, California.\r\nEarly in my ministry, I served for four years as an assistant pastor to Chuck Smith at Calvary Chapel of Costa Mesa, California. Next Jean and I moved to Lake Arrowhead where we planted and pastored Calvary Chapel of Lake Arrowhead. During those years I founded Calvary Chapel Bible College in nearby Twin Peaks at the Calvary Chapel Conference Center (The college is now located in Murrieta Hot Springs). Sensing the Lord's direction to move on, we then pioneered and pastored another Calvary Chapel in Redlands, California, for eleven years. In 1991, we again, still having that pioneering heart, moved to San Jose with the heart to plant a number of churches in the Bay Area. There are now eight fellowships that have grown out of Calvary Chapel of San Jose. In September 2002, we responded to a request from Chuck Smith to return to Calvary Chapel of Costa Mesa to serve as an assistant. And, in 2004 we took to the leadership of Calvary Chapel of Laguna Beach to help guide it through a difficult time. That work being completed, we have now responded to a long time desire to step out and serve the churches and schools and missionaries that we love so much around the world. Which brings us now to Calvary Way Ministries.",

Yet, in his own words, he was still unable to \"preach Christ the way He ought to be preached\". Listen to this powerful message.",

We must come to the Lord with a WHOLE heart - and not TRY Him, but SERVE Him, because He is GOD. Many do not get through to God because they are seeking their own agenda, or their own personal well being rather than the purpose of Christ. The reason so many walk in confusion is because of this refusal to submit to God. Why do Christians not pray as they should? Are they not totally surrendered to following Jesus? Do they not understand the heart of God and his love for them? This unjust judge had authority in Luke 18 over this widow woman's adversary, and she knew her rights, and she did not give up. The devil accuses us, pointing out our faults, and God avenges us by giving us the very thing we lack, when we seek him for it. God delights in his children and will rise up to deliver them when they are under attack.  Another wonderful encouragement to prayer.",

During those years I founded Calvary Chapel Bible College in nearby Twin Peaks at the Calvary Chapel Conference Center (The college is now located in Murrieta Hot Springs). Sensing the Lord's direction to move on, we then pioneered and pastored another Calvary Chapel in Redlands, California, for eleven years. In 1991, we again, still having that pioneering heart, moved to San Jose with the heart to plant a number of churches in the Bay Area. There are now eight fellowships that have grown out of Calvary Chapel of San Jose. In September 2002, we responded to a request from Chuck Smith to return to Calvary Chapel of Costa Mesa to serve as an assistant. And, in 2004 we took to the leadership of Calvary Chapel of Laguna Beach to help guide it through a difficult time. That work being completed, we have now responded to a long time desire to step out and serve the churches and schools and missionaries that we love so much around the world.

Although all can recall wrongdoing, the Law has been given to convict us of sin -- to show the enormity of our crime against a holy, just, and righteous God. Until we are convicted of our crime and cry out to be free, the Gospel of salvation holds no real meaning. Unfortunately, most preaching over the last 100 years has not started with the Law but has instead been offering a Gospel to people who are really unaware from what they must be saved. The Holy Spirit has thus been stripped of \"the only tool He has ever used to prepare men for Grace.\" The Law was never intended for Salvation, but to reveal the character of both God and man and to point to man's need of Christ.
