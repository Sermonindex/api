He maintained through all his ministry what he himself called a \"sweetheart love for the Lord Jesus,\" and it is most surely apparent in his messages.\r\n\r\nHe was an acclaimed preacher of primarily the 1940's and 1950's.About 100,000 professed faith in Christ during his decades of preaching. He was initially associated with John R.Rice in the 1940's. However,after giving a scripturally based message on John 6 Before rice and some other fundamentalist leaders he was kicked out of the Fundamentalist camp. He then went on the independent circuit. His preaching tours as an evangelist were mainly in the American south.But he also ministered in the mid-west and Canada as well.",

I came to Christ at a Billy Graham Los Angeles Crusade in the 1960's. While completing my Bachelor of Science degree in Business Administration at Cal Poly Pomona, I sensed the call of God on my life to follow Jesus Christ completely and possibly forget business and prepare for the ministry.. Soon after that I met Alan Redpath who invited me and my wife Jean to England, where we attended Capernwray Bible School. Upon returning to the United States, I continued my studies at Talbot Seminary in La Mirada, California.\r\nEarly in my ministry, I served for four years as an assistant pastor to Chuck Smith at Calvary Chapel of Costa Mesa, California. Next Jean and I moved to Lake Arrowhead where we planted and pastored Calvary Chapel of Lake Arrowhead. During those years I founded Calvary Chapel Bible College in nearby Twin Peaks at the Calvary Chapel Conference Center (The college is now located in Murrieta Hot Springs). Sensing the Lord's direction to move on, we then pioneered and pastored another Calvary Chapel in Redlands, California, for eleven years. In 1991, we again, still having that pioneering heart, moved to San Jose with the heart to plant a number of churches in the Bay Area. There are now eight fellowships that have grown out of Calvary Chapel of San Jose. In September 2002, we responded to a request from Chuck Smith to return to Calvary Chapel of Costa Mesa to serve as an assistant. And, in 2004 we took to the leadership of Calvary Chapel of Laguna Beach to help guide it through a difficult time. That work being completed, we have now responded to a long time desire to step out and serve the churches and schools and missionaries that we love so much around the world. Which brings us now to Calvary Way Ministries.",

Upon returning to the United States, I continued my studies at Talbot Seminary in La Mirada, California.\r\nEarly in my ministry, I served for four years as an assistant pastor to Chuck Smith at Calvary Chapel of Costa Mesa, California.

During those years I founded Calvary Chapel Bible College in nearby Twin Peaks at the Calvary Chapel Conference Center (The college is now located in Murrieta Hot Springs). Sensing the Lord's direction to move on, we then pioneered and pastored another Calvary Chapel in Redlands, California, for eleven years. In 1991, we again, still having that pioneering heart, moved to San Jose with the heart to plant a number of churches in the Bay Area. There are now eight fellowships that have grown out of Calvary Chapel of San Jose. In September 2002, we responded to a request from Chuck Smith to return to Calvary Chapel of Costa Mesa to serve as an assistant. And, in 2004 we took to the leadership of Calvary Chapel of Laguna Beach to help guide it through a difficult time. That work being completed, we have now responded to a long time desire to step out and serve the churches and schools and missionaries that we love so much around the world.

This passage of Scripture consumed David for months and he studied it from every angle.  This is absolutely the best sermon on this topic of righteousness that I have heard, separating real righteousness from much of the emotional righteousness that many seem to subscribe to this day. Jesus said you would know the truth and the truth shall set you free. Sanctification is the Spirit of Christ in us making us to become what God in reality sees you to be already, by faith. Making us what we could never be on our own, holy. The gift of righteousness is the Spirit of Christ in you. When you yield to him and let him have control, he makes you what he is. The Lord doesn't want you to come to him in condemnation and guilt. He wants the truth of his righteousness and his love to set you free.",
