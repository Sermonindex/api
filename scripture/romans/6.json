With customary passion he contrasts the natures of people before and after conversion, and shows how the truths of Romans 6 empower believers to live according to Romans 12  (55 minutes).",

Often times it may well just be one area that remains but nonetheless folks continue in that sin.  Wilkerson preaches a very personal message here and he shares his heart and shows his own weakness as an example.  The consequences for a Christian continuing in sin are sobering, but he gave us what we needed to overcome sin, if we want to. For those who are sick of their sin, and hate it, and cry out to God, there is wonderful news. He will empower you, and he wants to put his fear in your heart so you will not turn away from him, and then he can take you into the fullness of the new covenant. Powerful preaching, with a gentle compassion for those who are struggling.",

First the dominion of sin is the guilt of sin which is the same as the power of sin, sin has power over us when we feel the guilt that comes with it, and the passage of time does nothing to releave the power of sin over us to make us feel condemned.  Secondly to be under the Law means that we are trying to please God by trying to keep the moral Law which cannot be done thus the law is the power of sin, as we try and keep the law and fail the guilt , or power, of sin increases on us, we thus end up feeling so condemned that we think that bit of extra sin cannot make a bad situation worse.  Thirdly though despite all this we are under grace, not the dominion of sin, neither the law but grace!  The grace of God is shown in that even though we deserve Hell He gives us love and mercy.  Finally to reckon ourselves dead to sin means to realise sin has no more power to condemn us because of the work of the Lord Jesus on the cross of calvary.",

            "description": "This Psalm depicts Israel escaping the snare of the fowler, which is a figure of the redeemed being freed from the entrappings of sin by the gracious hand of the Lord Jesus.  The power of sin over the christian, or anyone, is it's ability to condemn and maintain our guilt before the law of God, we can go on for years under the power of a sin that we may only have commited once, this is the sanre designed by Satan himself and the more we try and work our way free the tighter it becomes and the more condemned we feel trying to live up to the law in order to please God.  But praise God for the Lord Jesus who took upon Himself the wieght of sin and not only that but became my sin and yours for us, He alone could have exhausted the power of sin and the law over us and so He alone can free us from it's grasp.",
