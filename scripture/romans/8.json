            "description": "A. W. Tozer strikes a blow against fear. With searing eloquence and sober erudition, Dr. Tozer sets forth an extremely encouraging message for all of Christ\u2019s servants and missionaries. He starts by taking us through Romans 8:33-39 to underscore the bold exhortation of 1 Peter 3:13. Nothing can harm a good man! \u201cNothing can debase his quality, nothing can reduce his dimensions, nothing can prevent the fulfillment of his destiny, nothing can block the accomplishment of his appointed task, and nothing can lower his value before God and the universe!\u201d With this May 16, 1954 sermon, Pastor Tozer marked one year from the beginning of his 34-part series on Peter\u2019s first epistle. \u201cWho is He That Will Harm You?\u201d is the 27th message, preached at Southside Alliance Church in Chicago, Illinois. It is 38 minutes, 43 seconds in length.",

He was involved in the missionary alliance movement for most of his pulpit life. A.W. Tozer lived in the presence of God he saw clearly and he spoke as a prophet to the church. He sought for God's honor with the zeal of Elijah and mourned with Jeremiah at the apostasy of God's people. \r\n\r\nLeonard Ravenhill was a close friend of pastor and writer A. W. Tozer and spoke of him as one of the most influential voices in the Church in America. A.W. Tozer's materials are a mainstay in Evangelical churches in our day and he is one of the most quoted authors. He was a prophet in his day and his writings are even more influential in our day. One of his books: The Pursuit of God, has had over 1 million copies sold world-wide.",

Paul Washer begins his exhortations by dealing with the speculations (AV = \u2018imaginations\u2019) which must be cast down if we are to fulfil our calling to be a biblical people. He focuses on the roles of men in particular, both in their families and their local churches, which he shows to be the two hardest places to live out a Biblical manhood. Most problems in those two areas, he says, can be traced back to men not standing on truth and not acting Biblically. Working through specific examples, he shows how the speculations of men actually fight against God, and also shows how such things should be put right. He then focuses in some detail on marriage, using Romans 8:28. Once a man discovers the true purpose of marriage, and learns what it means to love his wife as Christ loves the church, he will find both joy and rest in putting an end to his former speculations about the nature of marriage.

Once we have been prepared to dwell in that fire, and for that fire to dwell in us, we can then go out and minister to lost mankind, bringing that fire and that life to people \u2013 it will flow out of us and bring life and light. Dr. Thompson says that is our eternal purpose in Christ \u2013 to be priests of God in His Kingdom forever. He discusses the unique unity that Adam and Eve shared, and the similarities with the unity that Christ and the Church are to have. This sermon will challenge you to look at your relationship with God in whole new ways (that sounds clich\u00e9, but it is very true in this case).",

He says there are only two ways to live, two ways that you can approach any decision or action \u2013 either in the flesh or in the spirit. If you don\u2019t live after the Spirit, you are still under condemnation. He discusses the difference between \u201cthe pursuit of happiness\u201d and \u201cthe pursuit of righteousness.\u201d He says the key to \"living in the Spirit\" can be found in Proverbs 3:5-6, \u201cIn all your ways acknowledge Him\u2026\u201d Dr. Thompson finishes by discussing some \"big picture\" elements, such as, why God created man as a response to the rebellion of the angels.

Of course those things could be added but that's not the reason you come to God neither the reason God saves you. God saves you that you might know Him and do His will, wherever He might lead. Someone asked one of the co-workers why he wasn't preaching a Gospel of love, blessedness and material prosperity. He answered that we preach the love of God as revealed in His Son Jesus who suffered and died for us on the cross because of our sin. He died so that we can be saved, do His will and lay down our lives for our fellowmen so that they too can be saved. The man then broke down and answered that he realizes for the first time that he has never been saved, but only followed after other men.",

Manley chose daily healing because for him it was an act of faith that each day the Lord had to heal him to the point that he could get out of bed.

So also we must recognize that, being made as \u201cgods\u201d (John 10:34) we were given the free will to choose our present condition.  God is not to be blamed for the suffering we have chosen, neither is He to be blamed for the wreckage as a result of it.  Just as our Lord was, so also we need to be perfected through sufferings.  Suffering offers mankind the option to change.  We were cast out of eternity into time so that our decision could be corrected, and Jesus came and suffered for us so that we could be reconciled.",

            "description": "Paul Washer shows that the sovereignty of God begins not with our salvation, not even with our birth, but before the foundation of the world, when God predestinated us to our ultimate purpose. Few people know, with real, unshakeable certainty, that everything is working together for good. If you don\u2019t believe it, you probably have the wrong definition of good. Are you discontented? Are you shaken by adversities, or the removal of blessings and comforts? Mr Washer uses these verses to reveal the causes and the remedy. God has made us sons and daughters, a high calling indeed; yet whilst we certainly benefit, the prime beneficiary is God\u2019s son. God is making brothers and sisters for his son, a fellowship of those who stand in awe of their elder brother and worship him; and we can only worship him truly if we are conformed to his image. We have to be made like him to know how worthy he is; and the more we know him, the more we will be drawn to worship him. Is God\u2019s ultimate purpose your purpose? Is your eye single in this respect? If not, Mr Washer explains what you should do.  (29 minutes)",
