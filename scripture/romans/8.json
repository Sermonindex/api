            "description": "A. W. Tozer strikes a blow against fear. With searing eloquence and sober erudition, Dr. Tozer sets forth an extremely encouraging message for all of Christ\u2019s servants and missionaries. He starts by taking us through Romans 8:33-39 to underscore the bold exhortation of 1 Peter 3:13. Nothing can harm a good man! \u201cNothing can debase his quality, nothing can reduce his dimensions, nothing can prevent the fulfillment of his destiny, nothing can block the accomplishment of his appointed task, and nothing can lower his value before God and the universe!\u201d With this May 16, 1954 sermon, Pastor Tozer marked one year from the beginning of his 34-part series on Peter\u2019s first epistle. \u201cWho is He That Will Harm You?\u201d is the 27th message, preached at Southside Alliance Church in Chicago, Illinois. It is 38 minutes, 43 seconds in length.",

Many wonderful principles from years of experience are relayed in this sermon, if you are thinking of courtship or marriage, this teaching will greatly benefit the glory of God in that respect.",

Paul Washer begins his exhortations by dealing with the speculations (AV = \u2018imaginations\u2019) which must be cast down if we are to fulfil our calling to be a biblical people. He focuses on the roles of men in particular, both in their families and their local churches, which he shows to be the two hardest places to live out a Biblical manhood. Most problems in those two areas, he says, can be traced back to men not standing on truth and not acting Biblically. Working through specific examples, he shows how the speculations of men actually fight against God, and also shows how such things should be put right. He then focuses in some detail on marriage, using Romans 8:28. Once a man discovers the true purpose of marriage, and learns what it means to love his wife as Christ loves the church, he will find both joy and rest in putting an end to his former speculations about the nature of marriage.

I wonder what they had to tell, because there were other angels up there waiting and wondering what in the world happened when Jesus Christ the Son of God came among men.  What happened?  Oh, I think there must have been real sadness in heaven.  \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Why, they were all asleep\u00e2\u20ac\u201dthe whole city of the King.  They were all asleep.  We couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t even wake them up with our trumpets.  We had to go out into the field where the shepherds were watching.  They were awake.  They were awake\u00e2\u20ac\u201dthey heard us.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d I heard an Alliance preacher say that angels don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t sing.  I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know.  All our songs talk about angels singing.  But the Bible doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t say that.  They talked; they had a message\u00e2\u20ac\u201da very wonderful message, but nobody there to listen to it, nobody there to be interested.  \u00e2\u20ac\u0153He came unto His own\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6\u00e2\u20ac\u009d\u00e2\u20ac\u201dwhat a fact; how very wonderful: this entire Old Testament was a preparation for the coming of the King to this earth, and was intended to prepare hearts to be ready to receive Him.  But when He came, there was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153no form nor comliness that we should desire Him.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d  My goodness, who in the world would have looked for Him in a manger\u00e2\u20ac\u201din a manager in a stable?",

The sermon preached to Paul wasn't like so many of today's sermons, where people are told that they should come to Jesus to be happy, joyful, blessed, rich etc. That's why so many fall away. Of course those things could be added but that's not the reason you come to God neither the reason God saves you. God saves you that you might know Him and do His will, wherever He might lead. Someone asked one of the co-workers why he wasn't preaching a Gospel of love, blessedness and material prosperity. He answered that we preach the love of God as revealed in His Son Jesus who suffered and died for us on the cross because of our sin. He died so that we can be saved, do His will and lay down our lives for our fellowmen so that they too can be saved. The man then broke down and answered that he realizes for the first time that he has never been saved, but only followed after other men.",

After the captivity in Babylon, many of Israel had grown comfortable and stayed, rather than returning. Mixture in the world gives the enemy room to rise up and rule over you. Esther fasted and prayed, but she then had to get up and go to the king. We, as the Body of Christ, need to remember we are ambassadors of Christ, and there is no time for games. Jesus is coming, and we need to come out from among the world, and seperate ourselves for his purposes. If you are struggling with your flesh, this message will help you, and hopefully motivate you. Esther risked her life to intercede for her people. We need to risk whatever will come into our lives whether persecution, or trouble, to be seperated to God's purposes.",

Rather all creation \"groans\" under the burden of sin and we are lost because of it. In spite of that, however, God's voice constantly calls us to come to Him -- to rest in the safety of His sheltering arms. Dr. Tozer tells of a God who so loves His creation so much that He offers both love and hope, even though we are hopelessly lost.",

So also we must recognize that, being made as \u201cgods\u201d (John 10:34) we were given the free will to choose our present condition.  God is not to be blamed for the suffering we have chosen, neither is He to be blamed for the wreckage as a result of it.  Just as our Lord was, so also we need to be perfected through sufferings.  Suffering offers mankind the option to change.  We were cast out of eternity into time so that our decision could be corrected, and Jesus came and suffered for us so that we could be reconciled.",

            "description": "Paul Washer shows that the sovereignty of God begins not with our salvation, not even with our birth, but before the foundation of the world, when God predestinated us to our ultimate purpose. Few people know, with real, unshakeable certainty, that everything is working together for good. If you don\u2019t believe it, you probably have the wrong definition of good. Are you discontented? Are you shaken by adversities, or the removal of blessings and comforts? Mr Washer uses these verses to reveal the causes and the remedy. God has made us sons and daughters, a high calling indeed; yet whilst we certainly benefit, the prime beneficiary is God\u2019s son. God is making brothers and sisters for his son, a fellowship of those who stand in awe of their elder brother and worship him; and we can only worship him truly if we are conformed to his image. We have to be made like him to know how worthy he is; and the more we know him, the more we will be drawn to worship him. Is God\u2019s ultimate purpose your purpose? Is your eye single in this respect? If not, Mr Washer explains what you should do.  (29 minutes)",
