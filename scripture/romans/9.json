The struggle of Jacob and Esau in the womb depicts the struggle in the believer between flesh and spirit.  God's sovereign choice of Jacob was not according to works, which has principles of rest for us, such as being delivered from competition and jealousy over ministry with others in the church.  Isaac's partiality at age 80 is a warning to be steadfast to the spiritual zeal of younger years.",

            "description": "Pastor Legge begins with some very sobering stories about the apathy that is rampant in the world today and also sadly in the hearts of those that are His church. The spirit of apathy could, according to a leading scholar, be the very thing that brings our society and that the epitaph of our society will be \"This society died because it just couldn't be bothered\". This spirit is seeping into the church and we see the contrast between it and that man of God the Apostle Paul. He shows how we will not be able to win souls until we have wept for souls and our own apathy has been nailed to the Cross.\r\n\r\n[i]All material by Pastor Legge is copyrighted.

The reason is simply because if we do not, we will be contradicting and removing from the heart of God and His prophets, the very thing that was central to Him! This was the agony as well as the ecstasy of the apostle Paul in his epistle to the Romans. He tells us that if we are ignorant of this mystery, we are in danger of becoming wise in our own conceit. In this deeply-sobering and enlightening message, Art Katz shares on the mystery and the relationship the Church has with the Jews and how we are called to be agents of Israel's restoration!",

He notes that God created man from the dust of the Earth while saying \u201cLet us make man in our own image.\u201d Even though man is merely a created being, man no longer recognizes God\u2019s right and authority to form and shape his creation according to the \u201cpleasure of his own will.\u201d Yet, rather then a call to become passive and fatalistic, this sermon is a call for faithful obedience and trust just as God is faithful to never remove us from his potters wheel.",

            "description": "This message was preached on October 5, 2008 at Valley Church in Smithfield, Utah. \"Hath not the potter power over the clay, of the same lump to make one vessel unto honor, and another unto dishonor?\" Delivered with much \"fear and trembling\", this sermon is an exegesis of Romans 9:14-29 and an examination of the God's sovereign election in salvation. There is so much misunderstanding and confusion that surrounds the issue of election, and my hope is that this message will clear much of that away. The Church must not be ashamed of, or apologize for, God, and one of the greatest hindrances to our coming into the fullness of the stature of Christ is our failure to embrace this essential God glorifying truth: that salvation is all of God and not of man.",

            "description": "One of the devil's tricks is to bring his own people into religious debates. From these \"dialogs,\" we get a 'redefining\" of God's Word. We get a \"redefinition\" of sin. We get a redefinition of Truth. There is even a redefinition of the voice of the conscience. Some worldly philosophers define conscience as the culmination of all the good behaviors learned over childhood from parents. But the Scriptures talk about conscience as being from God. Paul speaks of it by name in Romans 2:15 and Romans 9:1. And, as Dr. Tozer points out in this message, the voice of the conscience is always on God's side, never the world's.",
