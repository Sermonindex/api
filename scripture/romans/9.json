The struggle of Jacob and Esau in the womb depicts the struggle in the believer between flesh and spirit.  God's sovereign choice of Jacob was not according to works, which has principles of rest for us, such as being delivered from competition and jealousy over ministry with others in the church.  Isaac's partiality at age 80 is a warning to be steadfast to the spiritual zeal of younger years.",

This spirit is seeping into the church and we see the contrast between it and that man of God the Apostle Paul.

Edwards \"is widely acknowledged to be America's most important and original philosophical theologian,\" and one of America's greatest intellectuals. Edwards's theological work is broad in scope, but he was rooted in Reformed theology, the metaphysics of theological determinism, and the Puritan heritage. Recent studies have emphasized how thoroughly Edwards grounded his life's work on conceptions of beauty, harmony, and ethical fittingness, and how central The Enlightenment was to his mindset. Edwards played a critical role in shaping the First Great Awakening, and oversaw some of the first revivals in 1733\u201335 at his church in Northampton, Massachusetts.\r\n\r\nEdwards delivered the sermon \"Sinners in the Hands of an Angry God\", a classic of early American literature, during another revival in 1741, following George Whitefield's tour of the Thirteen Colonies. Edwards is well known for his many books, The End For Which God Created the World, The Life of David Brainerd, which served to inspire thousands of missionaries throughout the 19th century, and Religious Affections, which many Reformed Evangelicals still read today.",

This was the agony as well as the ecstasy of the apostle Paul in his epistle to the Romans. He tells us that if we are ignorant of this mystery, we are in danger of becoming wise in our own conceit.

There is so much misunderstanding and confusion that surrounds the issue of election, and my hope is that this message will clear much of that away. The Church must not be ashamed of, or apologize for, God, and one of the greatest hindrances to our coming into the fullness of the stature of Christ is our failure to embrace this essential God glorifying truth: that salvation is all of God and not of man.",
