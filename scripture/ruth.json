Th ifrst thing the Lord did was to give David Himkself, and David was filled with a great sense of the Lord's power and glory.  The second thing the Lord gave to David was the support of his family, who in times past had been harsh towards David.  Then the Lord brough the needy and discouraged to David, and he became their leader, he took care of his parents by taking them to the Moabites, who were David's ancestors.  King saul in the meentime is plotting against David and accusing all his military commanders of being against him, one steps forward, Doeg the Edomite and informs Saul that he saw David being helped by Ahimelech the priest, Sauls is furiuos and goes to Ahuimelech and accueses him of aiding the enemies of the king, Ahimelech had no idea that David was on the run from Saul due to Davids lies, but Saul didn't care and commanded all the priests and their families to be slaughtered, Sauls servants wouldn't do it but Doeg would and massacred a great number of people, when David heard of this he mourned and wrote Psalm 52.",

            "description": "The time of the judges was a time of moral confusion and spiritual decay. It was a time of spiritual confusion and moral decay due to the practice of sodomy and other problems. The story of Ruth is an appendix to the book of judges and fits back to into the time of the judges. Though you may look at an overall condition of an nation yet God is working in a very special way. And the book of Ruth gives an insight into this. In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth which is the biblical mode, but the humanistic viewpoint believes that man created God for our own needs. So man establishes his own moral standards this is very dangerous and is something is that is fully opposed to God. It is quite dangerous to fall into that trap because everyone really believes this and is doing it but we need to go against humanism and keep to Gods standard. God created man and established the moral standards for man. God is wanting to work in the lifes that have open hearts and minds towards Him.",

            "description": "September 27, 2009 - Bethlehem is the place where God was given for the needs of humanity. As Christians there is an inner desire that God plants in our heart to go into His field and gather up those whom are considered outcasts and unwanted. God wants to revive the present day church to find strength and power one more time in His redemptive love. We are called to go into the world and pick up what nobody wants and tell the world there is bread enough for all and this bread is Jesus Christ Himself. May we all be awakened to the absolute value of one soul!",
