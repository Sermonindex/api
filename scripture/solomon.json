As the Bridegroom opens the eyes of the bride, she sees five things: who He is as Lord, who she is as dark, how she became over involved in men's work, following the true flock, and finding a tremendous liberty with the groom.  Ed Miller shows each revelation how it pertains to our growth in our union with Christ.",

The heartbeat of Ed's message is your love affair with Jesus, entering into a real experience now of fresh comings of your Bridegroom!
