            "description": "Paul Washer argues that the Song Of Solomon is more than just a book about the relationship between a man and a woman, and he uses these verses to expound aspects of the church\u2019s living relationship with Christ. It is easy to learn principles about holiness, he says, but how much time do we spend in the presence of Christ? As Martin Lloyd Jones warned, our lives will become nothing but a bunch of cold principles if the presence and power of God is not in our life. (78 minutes)",

Descend from the crest of Amana, from the top of Senir, the summit of Hermon,  from the lions' dens and the mountain haunts of leopards.\" He shares on the need for the Presence of God in believers lives and having a passion for seeking and knowing God and His love.",
