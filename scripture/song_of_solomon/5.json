            "description": "October 28, 2007 - There is a false revival on the rise. It is the rise of the angry watchman who will cast stones at those who have gone astray from the Lord. This false revival consists of ministers who have led people away from the truth through legalism and a misguided prosperity gospel. They will forbid and command prodigals not to come into the presence of God until you work your way back into His favor through human effort and religion. We must not remove the veil from the bride of Christ. We have a righteousness that can not be taken away from us because Jesus is our veil.",

We conquer through the Blood of the Lamb (Rev 12:11). With His precious Blood He has redeemed us; not with silver or gold. In a garden you find beautiful flowers, with wonderful fragrance. This garden isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t just open to anybody. This garden is protected so that no wild animals can enter and damange it. The lives we live should be far more beautiful than human made gardens. Of all different communities and gatherings, nothing is as beautiful as the garden made by Jesus. And so we should reflect that beauty \u00e2\u20ac\u201c His beauty in His garden.",
