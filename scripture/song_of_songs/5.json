We conquer through the Blood of the Lamb (Rev 12:11). With His precious Blood He has redeemed us; not with silver or gold. In a garden you find beautiful flowers, with wonderful fragrance. This garden isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t just open to anybody. This garden is protected so that no wild animals can enter and damange it. The lives we live should be far more beautiful than human made gardens. Of all different communities and gatherings, nothing is as beautiful as the garden made by Jesus. And so we should reflect that beauty \u00e2\u20ac\u201c His beauty in His garden.",
