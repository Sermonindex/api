In the beginning of the Book of Jude we read, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Mercy, peace and love be yours in abundance.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d487 Do we find it easy to wish mercy on others in abundance or are we quick to condemn? One that finds it easy to judge others has lost the perspective that he was shown much mercy from God. For it is by grace and mercy we have been saved by the blood of God\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Son.

Their meetings were presided over by an elder or pastor who in turn was presided over by a local 'bishop', literally overseer, who would preside over all the church gatherings an example of a bishop would have been Titus who was told by Paul to appoint elders.  Again in this age of the church there was rapid church growth and the gosepl went as far as India Ethiopia and England. But these were times where the church was under great pressure as persecution was rife and suspicion and fear everywhere.",

            "description": "This is a personal letter written by the Apostle Paul to a young minister whom he had left on Crete. Like the Timothy correspondence, the letter to Titus is practical and discusses the everyday problems confronted by a young minister. This letter is probably to be dated between the first and the second letters to Timothy.",

Take the time to listen to this. It is only 22 minutes long delivered by Sparks in 1955, but it is of eternal value for them that has ears to hear.

            "description": "We preachers should revive each other so that the Gospel can go forth. Islamists like Gadaffi had said that they will take Europe simply by having more children, while Africa will become Islamic. We Christians should stop betray the Lord like Judas. We must remember who the real enemy, satan is. We find the grace of God first mentioned in the time of Noah, in Gen 6:8, \"Noah found favour in the eyes of the Lord\". Way back then Noah found grace in God\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s eyes. Jesus said in the last days will be a time like the time of Noah. There was sexual immorality and flirting around between boys and girls. And it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the same today. It reminds one of the large ship built in Britain, the Titanic. After the construction of that ship, which was at that time the largest ship of its time, one of the builders commented that even God cannot sink it. Many booked for its maiden voyage. It traveled through an area full of icebergs, struck one and sank. Most people on the Titanic drowned. At the moment when it struck the iceberg there was a party going on, but when the news spread that it had struck an iceberg, they changed the music to \"nearer my God to Thee\".",

The Man: regular systematic devotional habits, personal practical piety or holiness, purity of motivation.  2. The Message: biblical content, doctrinal substance, practical application.  3. The Manner:  urgency, orderliness, directness.",
