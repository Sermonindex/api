Their meetings were presided over by an elder or pastor who in turn was presided over by a local 'bishop', literally overseer, who would preside over all the church gatherings an example of a bishop would have been Titus who was told by Paul to appoint elders.  Again in this age of the church there was rapid church growth and the gosepl went as far as India Ethiopia and England. But these were times where the church was under great pressure as persecution was rife and suspicion and fear everywhere.",

Many other things we might give thee warning of (gentle Reader) if we had not exceeded the measure of a Preface already. It remaineth, that we commend thee to God, and to the Spirit of his grace, which is able to build further than we can ask or think. He removeth the scales from our eyes, the vail from our hearts, opening our wits that we may understand his word, enlarging our hearts, yea correcting our affections, that we may love it to the end. Ye are brought unto fountains of living water which ye digged not; do not cast earth into them with the Philistines, neither prefer broken pits before them with the wicked Jews. [Gen 26:15. Jer 2:13.] Others have laboured, and you may enter into their labours; O receive not so great things in vain, O despise not so great salvation! Be not like swine to tread under foot so precious things, neither yet like dogs to tear and abuse holy things. Say not to our Saviour with the Gergesites, Depart out of our coast [Matt 8:34]; neither yet with Esau sell your birthright for a mess of pottage [Heb 12:16]. If light be come into the world, love not darkness more than light; if food, if clothing be offered, go not naked, starve not yourselves. Remember the advice of Nazianzene, \"It is a grievous thing\" (or dangerous) \"to neglect a great fair, and to seek to make markets afterwards:\" also the encouragement of S. Chrysostom, \"It is altogether impossible, that he that is sober\" (and watchful) \"should at any time be neglected:\" [S. Chrysost. in epist. ad Rom. cap. 14. oral. 26.]\r\nLastly, the admonition and menacing of S. Augustine, \"They that despise God's will inviting them, shall feel God's will taking vengeance of them.\" [S. August. ad artic. sibi falso object. Artic. 16.] It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God; [Heb 10:31] but a blessed thing it is, and will bring us to everlasting blessedness in the end, when God speaketh unto us, to hearken; when he setteth his word before us, to read it; when he stretcheth out his hand and calleth, to answer, Here am I, here we are to do thy will, O God. The Lord work a care and conscience in us to know him and serve him, that we may be acknowledged of him at the appearing of our Lord Jesus Christ, to whom with the holy Ghost, be all praise and thanksgiving.

Way back then Noah found grace in God\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s eyes. Jesus said in the last days will be a time like the time of Noah. There was sexual immorality and flirting around between boys and girls. And it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the same today. It reminds one of the large ship built in Britain, the Titanic. After the construction of that ship, which was at that time the largest ship of its time, one of the builders commented that even God cannot sink it. Many booked for its maiden voyage. It traveled through an area full of icebergs, struck one and sank. Most people on the Titanic drowned. At the moment when it struck the iceberg there was a party going on, but when the news spread that it had struck an iceberg, they changed the music to \"nearer my God to Thee\".",
