In the beginning of the Book of Jude we read, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Mercy, peace and love be yours in abundance.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d487 Do we find it easy to wish mercy on others in abundance or are we quick to condemn? One that finds it easy to judge others has lost the perspective that he was shown much mercy from God. For it is by grace and mercy we have been saved by the blood of God\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Son. In the Book of Titus it says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Not because of righteous things we had done, but because of His mercy.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d",

When the wise men enquired where the Christ was to be born, the scribes and pharisees told them correctly that it was in Bethlehem, as it is written, \"But you, Bethlehem Ephrathah, though you are little among the thousands of Judah, yet out of you shall come forth to Me The One to be Ruler in Israel, Whose goings forth are from of old, from everlasting.\u201d (Micah 5:2). They knew God's Word but did not go to worship the Child, because His birth was not revealed to them.",
