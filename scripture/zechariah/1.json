            "description": "February 5, 2006 \u2013 Spiritual defeat is contrary thinking to the word of God. It is the seed of satan that works its way into the mind before it becomes a physical reality, but for the heart that can embrace this: God says\u201cI have turned to you in mercy, I have brought you home to me and my dwelling place in you shall be built\u201d. God has a predetermined design of what He intends to do in and through our lives. This work is started and completed by our Mater Carpenter Jesus Christ and His intentions are to design His church to become carpenters after His own heart. No devil can destroy this divine work.",
