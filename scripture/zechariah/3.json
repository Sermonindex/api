Wesley found that only when he renounced all of his efforts and trusted Christ alone did he enter into the joy of salvation.",

Prayer and reading the Word of God are necessary, but you must understand how to appropriate the blood of Jesus, how to stand on the accomplished work of the cross when the devil tries to bring you into condemnation or load you down with guilt over your failures. This is the secret of victory. \"And they overcame him by the blood and by the word of their testimony, and they loved not their lives to the death.\" Rev. 12:11. Powerful! A must hear for those who struggle with condemnation and guilt.",

Satan has formed an argument against the completeness of Christ and against the certainty od God's promises for every believer. But God speaks out to every demonic power that would come against us and He says \" the Lord rebuke you Satan\". God has plucked us out of the fire and God has caused our inquity to pass and we were brought into an endless power of His life so that we will glorify Him in the generation.",
