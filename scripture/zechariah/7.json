Pastor Chuck was used in the Jesus People revival where he was used along with others to minister to the hippy young people. They saw a work of the Spirit where many were added to the church and discipled. He has raised up many pastors who are a part of the Calvary Chapel movement now and where he pastors the large Costa Mesa church in California.\r\n\r\nThe Calvary Chapel movement is based of simple principles that Chuck Smith taught over the years such as: The priority of agape love, Simple fellowship amongst the saints, the breaking of bread, the teaching of God's word chapter by chapter and verse by verse. And lastly and most importantly the principle not by might nor by power but by my spirit saith the Lord.",

Shortly after her experience of being born-again the Lord called her to take a one-way ticket to Hong Kong, China. Her story is chronicled in the book: \"Chasing the Dragon\" which is a best-seller inspirational missionary story. He has founded St Stephen's Society in Hong Kong that helps serve drug addicts and gives them the life-transforming Gospel message.\r\n\r\nHer burden in ministry has been to show the love of Christ to the hurting and helpless. She saw in the message of the Gospel it had to have a response for us also to go and serve others. She teaches and shows this full-surrender is a simple response to receiving God's love in Jesus Christ.",
