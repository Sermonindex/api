The goal of the Christian life is to know and love God the Father, God the Son and God the Holy Spirit, receiving eternal life through the Son, and resulting in a glorious and personal relationship with the Triune God. Where we love Him, worship Him serve Him, obey Him and where we experience His love and His care for us.",

Bullmore concluded by emhasizing that those who receive God's salvation are called to rejoice with all their heart. There is no expereience here on earth which causes us to rejoice that can even come close to comparing with this.",
