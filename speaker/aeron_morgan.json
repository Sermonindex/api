David rouses himself in respect of every faculty of his God-touched and God-illumined being to be in the employ of worship. THIS is his delight. He stirs himself up so that all the powers of his soul, and every talent he was endowed with, was used to set forth God\u2019s praises. His soul cannot be dormant, inactive, or silent.

We have been reconciled to God to know Him in conscious, personal awareness, to be close to Him in profoundest communion, and as we gaze on Him in reverential awe and adoration, to be fashioned into the glory of His holy likeness.",

            "description": "Nothing is of greater importance in the believer\u2019s personal life than holiness. It appears the Church overlooks the fact that the goal of redemption is holiness. We major where the Bible minors, and minor where the Bible majors. The shallow and shifting emphases of the pulpit are replete with psychology, sociology, and humanistic philosophy; sermons that feed the ego, play to the emotions, ease the conscience, beguile the unwary, provide for the flesh, foster materialism and worldliness, and smother the fact that we are but \u201cstrangers and pilgrims\u201d in this world. Without holiness no man shall see the Lord. This message sets forth the attribute of HOLINESS in God \u2013 that absolute and immeasurable perfection of His moral nature, which is eternally consistent and allows of no variation; it is an absolute purity of nature that knows no degrees.",
