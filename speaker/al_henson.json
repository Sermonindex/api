            "description": "Revival is ALL His work. The ability to repent is only by the grace of God. We cannot repent of our own, only by the work of the Holy Spirit. Faith comes by hearing; hearing comes by the Word of God, but the Word of God coupled with only with the Holy Spirit is really hearing and understanding. Other than that, it is knowledge. Therefore, this work of the Holy Spirit, Jesus said, \u201cWAIT\u201d and tarry here in Jerusalem until you be endued with the power of the Holy Spirit. Sometimes there is no need to preach. What we need is to sense the need of revival and just \u2018tarry\u2019 before the Lord in prayer until we sense that God is hearing and answering our prayers by sending us the Holy Spirit that we might have genuine repentance and genuine faith and a genuine work of God.",
