            "description": "How many of us are truly desperate for the Lord? When you begin to search for wisdom and understanding as you would for priceless treasure, then you will find Him. God hides himself from the casual seeker. When life is going well we lose our passion for the Lord, our hunger. Sometimes God allows circumstances in our lives to expose how needy for him that we really are.  Just like in the life of Samson God will bring about circumstances that reveal that we are not as strong as we think we are. The strongest men realize their need for Christ and His strength and how much we need Him and his grace.",
