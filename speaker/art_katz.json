So also we need an apprehension of God as demonstrated through the cross to know what we are.  If we are not able to behold the cross, and see how God demonstrated himself, how will our idolitries be abolished?  To the degree that our perception of God is distorted, so also are we distorted.  With unconventional wisdom, Art Katz relishes in all that the cross will afford its most ardent adherents.  He bids the church to drop their porcelain and sentimental attachments to creedal views of Calvary.  We are warned in this sermon that a Christianity which is ever fixated upon the initial salvation level the cross affords, will never challenge the status quo in this world.",

From the garden on through the resurrection circumstances revealed.  No more were they boasting of their capacity to be the greatest.  During the dark night of the crisis of the Christ, all was revealed.  It is in this that the Apostle Paul gloried, nothing other than the cross of Christ, for nothing else has the capacity to reveal what we are.   The sufferings of Christ, viewed with sincerity, will always beget personal revelation.  We must be apprehended by the cross.  If this is not the case, then we will be absolutely unable to serve God in any form of spiritual community.  Just like it was a suffering for Christ to display the truth of who he was, so also, our apprehension of the truth of what we are will be suffering.",

Spurgeon, \"Jesus bears not the cross so that you may escape it, but that you may endure it,\" this sermon delivers a message which adopts and adheres the previous two messages into our own bearing of the cross.  It is stated herein that one of the greatest libels against the cross in our day is the idea that the believer in the cross is absented from any form of suffering.  It is the cruciform life which will generate a necessary friction against the kingdoms of this world.  We must apprehend that this conflict is an intention of God through his people, and in every sense, a diet of the things of this world will by nature slicken any apprehension of this cross-centered friction.   The hearing of this sermon in its deepest of intentions will bring you face to face with Jesus calling you Satan, that is to say...you are Satanic if you cherish not the things of God over the things of man. We are admonished to take up the cross and follow Christ for, \"Natural man is always the instrument by which Satanic things are brought into being in the collision between kingdoms.\"",
