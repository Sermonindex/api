Pastor Tozer treats us to several very astute word studies: \u201cwherefore,\u201d \u201claying aside,\u201d \u201cguile,\u201d \u201chypocrisies,\u201d \u201cenvies,\u201d and \u201csincere milk.\u201d Without rebirth, the most promising child, the actress in Hollywood, the president in the White House, and the eugenicists\u2019 theoretical \u201csuper man,\u201d all exist beneath the same two, dark clouds: mortality and corruption. Men die and then they rot; thank God for the birth that is incorruptible and never dies! Drawing wisely from Socrates, Pastor Tozer also challenges those liberals who ask, instead of turning from wickedness, \u201cWhat is wickedness?\u201d The length of the recording is 39 minutes and 5 seconds.",

We already know that the Bible is true; the big question is whether it is true in us. From 1 Peter 2:3-5, Pastor Tozer examines the terms, \u201ctasted,\u201d and \u201clively stones,\u201d and observes that Christians come out of the world, come away from the old life, come unto Christ, and come together. Drawing nearer to Jesus Christ is what draws Christians nearer to each other. The pastor also warns that we can get the gifts of God and then forget the God that gives. God gives himself in every gift, and it is God himself who matters more than all other gifts. The recording length is 38 minutes and 41 seconds.",

            "description": "In the 26th sermon of A. W. Tozer\u2019s superb study on First Peter, we examine with Dr. Tozer what the Holy Spirit means by the unanimity, compassion, pity, and courtesy of which Peter writes in verses 8 and 9 of the 3rd chapter. The pastor approaches these in his characteristically lively style, by telling us what they are not, in order that we may discover what they are. One should never mistake external uniformity for true inward unity, nor confuse empty etiquette with authentic courtesy, nor exalt rigid principles above concern for people and a supreme commitment to Christ the Lord. \u201cBe Ye All of One Mind\u201d was recorded in Chicago, Illinois, on Sunday, April 11, 1954. Its length is 36 minutes and 30 seconds.",

The pastor aptly declares, \u201cYou can\u2019t have power without the words, but you can have words without the power, and a lot of people do.\u201d",

            "description": "According to A.W. Tozer, new churches are usually more spiritual than established churches. Older congregations may have become complacent in their success and community status, and have cooled down on their First Love. That \"First Love,\" of course, is Jesus Christ. This was pointed out as a shortcoming of the long-established Ephesian church (Revelation 2:4) at the end of the Apostolic Age. Have you cooled off? Do you love Jesus as much as you did when you were first converted? In his message, Dr. Tozer examines his own congregation on that question.",

Pastor Tozer points out that the Pharisees were classic examples of knowing everyone else's ways but their own. They, who should have known better, ignored God's command to examine themselves, so they remained ignorant of their own actions and were spiritually stagnant.",

From John 3:16, Matthew 20:28, Acts 20:35, he asks us to note four truths: 1) the father gave his Son, 2) the Son gave his life, 3) they did so in order that we might be ransomed, and 4) it is more blessed to give than to receive. Dr. Tozer then considers who we might want to thank some day for the gifts that they gave to Jesus. The wise men gave gold (lasting treasure), frankincense (worship), and myrrh (bitter sacrifice); Mary gave her mortal body; Joseph gave his faith; the shepherds gave their reverent wonder; Lazarus and his sisters, Mary and Martha, gave the welcome of their home; the women following Jesus gave a seamless, linen robe; and Joseph of Arimathaea gave his own, new grave. These are the gifts that they gave to Jesus. What might we give him that we might not be outdone in giving?",

God doesn\u2019t need us, but He wants us. Though man possesses a natural desire to worship, he wishes to worship any way he feels like worshiping. The God who wants us to worship Him, however, has decreed how we are to do so. Pastor Tozer details three kinds of worship that God outrightly rejects: 1) \u201cCain worship:\u201d worship without atonement. 2) \u201cSamaritan worship:\u201d accepting what one wants to believe, neglecting what one doesn\u2019t, and adding what\u2019s not there at all. 3) \u201cNature worship:\u201d mistaking worship of God\u2019s creation for worship of God himself. John 4:24 describes the kind of worship that God gladly accepts. Psalm 45:11 and 2 Thessalonians 1:10 are also texts for this 39-minute sermon.",

I repeat that when God made the heaven and earth, they sang together and all the sons of God shouted for joy! There wasn\u2019t a funeral at the creation of the world; there was an anthem, and all the creature creations sang! And at the incarnation they sang!\u201d There was singing at the resurrection and we\u2019ll sing at the rapture and the consummation, and the song will be \u201cWorthy is the Lamb!\u201d The message is firmly grounded in 1 John 4:12-16, John 17:20-23, and Revelation 5:9-11.

Tozer stresses the absolutely indispensable role that the Holy Spirit plays in convicting men of sin, in the teaching of the Gospel, and in the preaching of the Word. The pastor aptly declares, \u201cYou can\u2019t have power without the words, but you can have words without the power, and a lot of people do.\u201d",

            "description": "The upbeat \u201cPersonal Victory For the New Year\u201d was recorded on the morning of New Year\u2019s Eve, 1961, in Toronto, Ontario. It was the first of at least two messages that Pastor A. W. Tozer preached on this date, the other being \u201cThe New Year As God Sees It,\u201d which he delivered shortly before midnight. In the morning message, he focuses on 1 Corinthians 16:13-14, and upon the critical importance of staying watchful. A sure way to let one\u2019s guard down is to believe that the Devil does not exist. The pastor goes on to contemplate masculine and feminine virtues, and reads from what he considers to be the most disturbing chapter of the Bible, 1 Corinthians 13:1-7. He concludes with three things that will make us strong: 1) the Spirit\u2019s infilling; 2) the Lord\u2019s indwelling; 3) prayer and the Scriptures. The length of the sermon is 42 minutes and 15 seconds.",

He\u2019s not the God of Heaven, and the God of Creation, but he\u2019s a homemade, handmade god you can pull down. He\u2019s a stuffed shirt; he\u2019s a Santa Claus; he\u2019s just an old uncle that we want to keep on his good side so that when the time comes he can make us rich\u2026\u201d 1 Chronicles 29:11 addresses the true JHVH: \u201cThine, O LORD is the greatness, and the power, and the glory, and the victory, and the majesty: for all that is in the heaven and in the earth is thine; thine is the kingdom, O LORD, and thou art exalted as head above all.\u201d The sermon was preached circa 1959, and is 39 minutes, 14 seconds in length.",

Tozer, in keeping with the historic Christian stance on the theater, condemns the religious movie, giving the following seven reasons: 1. It violates the scriptural law of hearing. 2. The religious movie embodies the mischievous notion that religion is, or can be made, a form of entertainment. 3. The religious movie is a menace to true religion because it embodies acting, a violation of sincerity. 4. They who present the gospel movie owe it to the public to give biblical authority for their act: and this they have not done. 5. God has ordained four methods only by which Truth shall prevail -- and the religious movie is not one of them. 6. The religious movie is out of harmony with the whole spirit of the Scriptures and contrary to the mood of true godliness. 7. I am against the religious movie because of the harmful effect upon everyone associated with it.",

The pastor addresses a range of other vital issues in this excellent sermon, reading from Job 23:6, Psalm 85:8, and Matthew 24:4-14. \u201cThe New Year As God Sees It\u201d was preached the night of New Year\u2019s Eve, 1961, in Toronto, Ontario.

The problem is not so much error of doctrine as error of emphasis. A Fundamentalist himself, the pastor touches on the history of Fundamentalists and the trouble with increasingly detailed eschatology that has coincided with their emergence over the past 100 years. In spite of many Evangelicals\u2019 dogmatic preoccupation with how to view the millennium, something has not changed and must never be forgotten: Jesus is coming back. Take heed. Beware. Watch. Worship the Christ who is returning in time, and not the details of that time itself. The recording runs for 41 minutes, 21 seconds.",

In spite of that, however, God's voice constantly calls us to come to Him -- to rest in the safety of His sheltering arms. Dr. Tozer tells of a God who so loves His creation so much that He offers both love and hope, even though we are hopelessly lost.",

Then, after a time, someone comes along and preaches the forgotten Truth -- as Martin Luther did with the doctrine of justification by faith. He was first considered a heretic for peaching an unfamiliar (actually, forgotten) doctrine, but it marked the beginning of the reformation of the church. Has justification by faith now overshadowed other truths, like the inevitability of God's judgment? Dr. Tozer explores this possibility and reaches some disturbing conclusions.",
