He encourages believers to entrust their loved ones to His care and to lay down the worries and fears of praying for the unsaved. Find rest in trusting your unsaved friends and family to an all powerful and loving God. Do you know the difference between praying and committing to God?  Bill shares precious testimonies of committing loved ones to the Lord and then trusting God to do it, even though nothing perceivable is happening.  One testimony was about his own mother who committed her husband and four sons to the Lord and waited 14 years for the first one to come to Christ; all did come eventually.  \"Don't try to figure out what God is doing,\" he reassures.",

He describes a revival that broke out in his church and grew as the Spirit moved in the area.The revival turned into a situation where buildings could not hold the people. There was rarely a full sermon given where the gospel message was preached, but yet hundreds of people were being converted and revived. The main focus of the message is to clean up our lives as Christians, and then God the Holy Ghost will do the work; we just have to get out of the way. Don't organize, don't build it up, just let God work, be obediant to Him, and our prayers will then be answered.",
