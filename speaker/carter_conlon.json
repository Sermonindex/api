If God is going to be honored in this generation we must begin to rebuild the testimony of Christ in our lives. You may ask yourself how does this happen? How do I begin to rebuild this wall? The first thing we do is apply the truth of God's Word to every area of our life where we are not in agreement with Him. Secondly, we must remove the rubble in our homes that has blocked the door to the prayer closet. Lastly, call our children by example into the work of God. Suddenly there will be a people arise and begin to build according the ways of God and they will do it all for His honor!",

            "description": "January 17, 2010 - That which satisfies the deepest longings of our heart is the living waters of Christ. Each of us is invited to drink and pass this cup of salvation. The question is, \u201cWhat do we do with this cup of salvation\u201d? This message points to examples in history where people were given a great opportunity to serve God but became self indulgent. The self indulgent church has nothing in his heart for his brother. It gravitates to the things of the world and its possessions, instead of living for Christ. There is a final warning to the self indulgent church to turn away from their sins and become charitable to the poor. There is a time when a sentence is written against those who were supposed to be a testimony in the earth. Recognizing and honoring truth is not enough, we must embrace it and walk it out! In one minute everything can change and only those who have the compassion of God for humanity will stand!",

The question is DO YOU SEE YOUR CALLING? Do you see that God has put the power of the resurrected Savior in the hand of the weakest of those who are called by Christ. We do not need any strength of our own, or any plan of our own, we need an obedient heart that will trust God for the power to work in and through us.",

The primary concern of the LOrd is that he get hold of your life and form himself in you, even if it means you might suffer because of what he's doing in your life. He wants the fruit of Christ manifested in you, that others will be brought out of darkness into the light. That your life be used for his glory and that you take up your cross and follow him daily. Not sure what your cross is? This message helps you understand.",

We all have a sin nature in us that desires to make choices apart from the will of God. God gave us the law as a school master to prove to us that we can't keep it. When we try to struggle our way out of a situation we are being God in that area. When we try to defeat sin in our own strength we are being God in that area. God the Father and Jesus Christ made a covenant with each other to put an end to sin and the power it has over us. It is only when we bend our knee to God and put our faith in the finished work of the Cross the struggle stops and God can be God to us. WE don't make promises to God, He makes them to us and He keeps them. It is not about works, it is all about faith in what Christ has already done.",

May we never become familiar and careless with the His presence that was purchased for a with a passionate love of a father that sent His only Son to Die on a cross so that we can be free.",

When the Lord has used His servant and His touch has come upon us there is a season of weeping and spiritual fatigue that will follow. It is in these seasons that satan himself will come with roaring accusations and attempt to lead us into a wilderness and a sense of powerlessness. It is complete fiction to believe the devil has any power to take you as a sincere believer from the security of your position through Christ in God. The devil can only come against us with roaring lies but in REALITY he has no power to do this. God Himself will come and whisper His mercy and love to show us we are not alone and evil will not triumph over us. He will vanquish our enemies with a still small voice and comfort and nourish us.",

When difficulties and trails come you will be tempted to take another course and follow another Jesus. The key to avoid this is to have a deep abiding trust in the faithfulness of God, knowing that His ways are not our ways and He has a divine plan. Take comfort in knowing we are in hands that are much bigger than ours and we will be triumphed over. Jesus Christ promises us we will make it to the other side.",

We are all resistant to change especially when it involves what we perceive to be hardship or loss to ourselves or someone we love. There is nothing in us that wants to gravitate toward difficulty. In the western world we have formed a Christian theological perspective that avoids difficulty, which results in an anemic Christianity. When we get a word from the Lord that sometimes doesn't make sense to the natural mind, we must be careful to who and what we listen to. There are well meaning people all along our journey that will unknowingly try to break your heart of obedience. God call us to a radical obedience where we will go where you lead us no matter what the cost! When we learn to walk in the ways of God and follow the voice of God the miraculous is released in our lives. Are you willing to respond to the Lord with, \u201chere I am Lord, send me\u201d?",

And that presence will produce in a hungry soul an ever increasing revelation of who Christ is. This is often revealed in us and to us through suffering and trials. We have this great kingdom which cannot be moved, such great victory, and power living in us. Pastor Conlon goes through many other scriptures revealing how the Lord Jesus Christ is our Treasure. The person drawing closer to Him, cannot help being awed by Him, and at the same time painfully aware of their own sinful flesh in comparison. If your heart is toward Christ he knows, and he will not let the enemy overwhelm you as you trust in him. Pursuit of an ever increasing knowledge and intimacy with Christ should be the Christian's number one priority. When we get careless with the word of God and prayer, tragedy can come. The devil is always after the treasure of the presence of Christ in your life. Pastor Conlon warns: There is no greater danger than to become careless with this Book!",

He goes on to show how this is in the mentality of many christains that think they can work the're way into the Lord's favour, without realising that we should love God because He first loved us and that we do not need to earn His love and favour because it is already ours in Christ out Lord.  One of the best messages I've heard in a long time, it brought me very close to tears, Praise be to God!!!",

The wilderness is not a place to be avoided, but rather a place to be understood. There is something of God in this place. God Himself will allure us there to speak comfort and strengthen us. He will take away all things that we believe He has given us, when in reality He never did. In this place God will deal with all that has captivated our heart and would hinder His life from being lived through us. In the wilderness the natural becomes supernatural and we are brought back to a right perspective. When we get through this deep dealing of God we are enabled to make the choice to be poured out for Jesus so that others can be grafted into His power and lineage. The lesson learned from this experience is that the power of God is found in those who will be given for others!",

When God sends someone to you who needs encouragement, lifting up will you be able to take time to support those who are falling down? Will you be able to stand up against the devil for your brothers and sisters in the church? Don't be willing to let them go. Hate it when you see the devil gain the advantage. Jesus left the flock for the one. He left the 99 for the one. When you see it, you pray, and you fast for them. You intercede, encourage, lift up. Support. This is the heart of God for his people and this is how he wants them to love one another. Ask God to give you the discernment to see the needs of others around you. To look past your needs and problems to those around you.",

This message encourages us that the Lord will finish the work that He has destined to do through you, but it doesn't have to be great in your sight. Those who win in the Kingdom of God finish the race not the way they thought they should, but knowing inside they finished what God has purposed for them to do.

God will allow seasons of discouragement when; there is something hidden in our heart and He wants to get at it; when we take that which belongs to the Lord and keep it for ourselves; and when we fail to realize there is a divine purpose even in the darkest of times. We must cry out to God and ask Him to take away the perception that coming to Christ is all about us. We are not called to live for ourselves. It is Christ is in us for the betterment of others. When we understand this truth God will transform the valley of trouble into a gateway of hope!",

            "description": "To pursue God's heart is to find a new value system for seeking wisdom rather than riches or your works. And scripture says \"He that winneth souls is wise\". When you are in love with Christ, it draws people to you. The joy it brings will make people around you sit up and take notice. And the joy of the Lord is your strength. Soul winning is the heart of Christ in you reaching out to the lost around you. Without intimate time alone with God you cannot be a soul winner.  You have to get close to God and be led by his Spirit.",

This message exposes several hindrances that keep the church from making a difference in the world.

When the Word comes and voices arise to condemn you, you can shoot them down (Is. 54:17). God loves you enough to not let you by with sin that will destroy you.

As you behold the mercy of God and the promises of God you will be changed into a new person. God longs to give you something deeper than a casual relationship. He longs to give you something deeper than just knowing some facts about Him. Have the courage to go deeper and come home to God today!",

The Bible says every knee will bow and every tongue will confess that Jesus Christ is Lord. Many will look for an opportunity to be saved, only to find it is too late. That is why Hell will be so tormenting. Many who refuse Christ now will come face to face with Jesus later only to find their opportunity for has passed them by! We are living in an amazing day of grace and the greatest news you can hear is that you can reach out and touch God for yourself. The condemned, cast out and defiled can press through and touch Christ. We live on the threshold of eternity every day. Bend your knee NOW. Confess Jesus as Lord NOW! Tomorrow is not promised to us.",

A person who will be missed has occupied a place that is visible to others. He or she may have been involved in what is considered good and high profile causes but in the context of Christ these activities could possibly have left them very far from the heart of God and the struggles of the people. A person who will be mourned has allowed the immeasurable supply of Christ's life through poured in us and through us onto the person God has placed before us. It is not the multitudes that we minister to or how big our ministry is, it is the ability we have in Christ to hear and respond to the cry of the one.",

It is through these fiery trials that we come out with an inner strength that declares mo matter what happens the life of God in us cannot be triumphed over! The key to this kind of life is to be free of offence and to have a good conscience towards God and man and to refuse to speak evil in a difficult situation. It doesn't matter how we feel or what happens, we must always allow the Holy Spirit to lead us back in line with the truth of God's Word. Do you want to stand in the fire? Your strength comes from allowing God's Word to have the last say in every circumstance!",

There are seasons in our life when God will allow forms of sorrow into our heart for His own purpose. Sometimes God will allow times of isolation so we can stop and think about His ways in order to get an eternal perspective. If you are feeling alone this message reminds us that it was the shepherds that were isolated out in the field who got the revelation of Jesus. It was Simeon a lonely man who waited for the comfort of Christ. And it was Anna, a widow who was no stranger to sorrow. Has it ever occurred to you that isolation and loneliness might be mandatory for us to see Christ in the midst of crisis. In the last days it talks about a bride filled with oil who will see Him in calamity. Those who have suffered will be filled with oil so they see the nearness of Christ and His power. Get ready to light your lamp and dance!",

In these last days demonic voices will arise to deceive us and lead us into captivity. How can we know when God is speaking to us? First, the voice of God will never promise us peace if we are embracing the same value system of the world. Second, the voice of God will challenge sin. In the dark days ahead the people of God will be lead into the tender mercies of God. God will give us a heart full of confidence when we choose to live uprightly.",

God has given us a LIFE PARTNER who is the HOLY SPIRIT to enable us to be more than we cloud ever be by any amount of human wisdom and strength. God is calling His church to lay down our lives for others. When we get back to the secret closet of prayer we will hear the Lord say go and get my sons and daughters, go and get your family.

Many turn back right at the place where they will begin to discover and enter into the supernatural life of God. When we are in unbelief we begin to limit God by doubting that He could supply what we need and take us where He is calling us to go. The central core of unbelief is that God's way is incomplete and we must help Him bring His plan to pass. If you are sitting in unbelief, remove yourself from that place and grab on to the promises of God. We must learn how to trust God for strength and provision. Don't pray to get out of the situation, pray that you may find supernatural life in it. God is looking for people who have come through the wilderness with a voice of triumph to speak to the next generation. Do you believe that God CAN, or will you limit the Holy One of Israel?",

If our separation to God for the purpose of freeing others from oppression is willfully and unwittingly forfeited than we will become weak in the hands of the enemy. We are called to be separated unto God and empowered by the Spirit of God for the sake of every lost soul. If we would know the Lord's strength we must give Him our ALL and embrace HIS plan for our life.",

He doesn't sit in Heaven with His arms crossed despising your struggle. He deeply desires you to allow Him to take you by the hand and lift you into His awesome love and power.",

The Cross is the power of God in Christ to overpower all the forces of darkness. Because of the Cross the impossible becomes possible. So how do we embrace the power of the Cross? The answer is simple. You can stare at the Cross in unbelief or you can put out your hand by faith and take the victory. We cannot have sin in our life and have the power of the Cross. You have to choose to walk out of sin and walk into the power of God!",

God the Father sent His Son Jesus Christ to sacrifice His life so we can have intimate access to God. We were created for intimacy with a living God. Some people go through their whole life searching to satisfy this need. Today Jesus Christ offers you this intimacy. The Bible says there is a day coming when some will stand before a Holy God only to find they let this intimacy and eternal life slip though their fingers. Sad to say in that moment you will understand how much God loved you. Today is the day of salvation, don't let it slip away.",

It\u2019s a fire that is always gathering and burning that which does not conform to the image of Christ within us. Jesus will try our works everyday by fire constantly changing and challenging and taking those things that are unlike Him and burning them in the fire of His passionate love for us.",

When Samson stood captive in the presence of the Philistines and they mocked and laughed at him, now blind, and seemingly defeated, they had no idea they were about to die. Today many Christians are in positions where the enemy of their souls taunts and ridicules them, but like Samson, we have the Source of power we need to overcome.

Our life is to be an extension of the love and mercy of God and to give of ourselves unselfishly. When we choose to go this way with God we will be lead on a journey into hard places. In these hard places God will visit us. We will find wisdom and compassion for every dreadful place God allows us to go through. Heaven will open to the person who is willing to be poured out for the good and betterment of others.",

The law of kindness radiates through the mouth of those who are one in heart and mind with Jesus and whose deep desire is to live a life that is conformed to the cross of Christ. When we speak with the law of kindness we take our Savior and put Him in the gates in a place of honor. Kind speech puts a crown of glory on Jesus and those around us have to take notice.

God is more powerful then any enemy that comes our way. Magnifying the enemy over the greatness of our God is saying in our hearts that there is no God. There is a point in our lives when we have to face our fears and believe God to deliver us. God has already defeated every enemy we will ever face in Jesus Christ. We must understand the enemy is not defying us, but rather he is attempting to defy the Christ in us who has purchased us with His own Blood. We are called to be a compelling testimony to this generation and to show that Jesus Christ is alive.",

Sometimes it is as simple as hearing a Word from God. There is a point when God quiets every voice and calls you to be silent before Him so He can calm the storm.

There is an incredible depth, an immeasurable depth to the provision that He has made for our failure, our day to day failure, our struggles and our trials. Jesus did not come because He felt some legal obligation to redeem us. He came because He is a God of mercy, a God of compassion! Mercy will fill our churches, mercy will touch our pastors again in New York City, mercy will cause the churches in Christ in this city to start feeding the hungry again, mercy will bring the presence of God into our prayer meetings.",

If we desire to hear God's voice we have to hear the whole package, the provision of God and the cry of God for the helplessness of humanity. We must offer all that we are so that God's heart would be satisfied in the earth. If you are willing to be given for others you will know and hear the voice of Jesus. The question is, \"will you give your all for the glory of God\"?",

He is a God who makes something out of nothing. God needs nothing to work with. Too many in the church today are not willing to admit that we are nothing, and so we are hindering God from working in us and through us.

The power source of this light is Jesus Christ and His life burning in us. This light is not kindled by man and cannot be put out by man.

When we are betrayed it is a pain like no other. The devil will do his best to keep us behind the gates of betrayal so that we keep a distance from people and vow never to trust again. We know we are passing through these gates when we choose to forgive and begin to have a strong desire to be reconciled with our betrayer. We will come to a place of undersatnding that God has been in control all along and the life of Christ that is imparted into us through this experience will become provision for someone else.",

When the Holy Spirit consumes our heart we will have a compassion that causes us to look away from self and look to the needs of others. When the Holy Spirit comes down a dedication comes to the House of God there is corporate worship and wholehearted fellowship with other believers. We will be totally abandoned to God and fellow man. Ask for the Holy Spirit to give you the testimony of Jesus Christ to be alive in your heart so Pentecost can move outside the church.",

The Bible says to keep asking and we will receive. But what are we asking for? This message makes an appeal to us to put away childish prayers that are self-focused and begin to ask for the power and provision we need to minister to fallen humanity. Ask God for a heart for this world and an awareness of how much He loves people. Those who are looking away from self and are given for the work of God will be given supernatural strength in the coming storm!",

Use my life to bring healing and freedom to those who are lost.\u201d What will revival look like? All people with a no name ministry will suddenly show up with the glory of God on them. Grandmothers who laid hold of the Cross will begin to speak to a younger generation. Young people like David in the Bible who will not cower under the pressure of this society will rise up with a cry that says, \"is there not a cause?\" There is coming a season when God will turn the people\u2019s hearts back to Him and He will pour out His Spirit on all flesh.",

If we are called by God the powers of darkness know the potential we have in Christ. When we come to our red sea of impossibility God promises every enemy will be drowned behind us. There is a glory that will come upon a people who choose to get into the Word of God and simply declare the impossible possible. There will be a people in this last hour of time who have the testimony of Jesus Christ and a glory song that the world must reckon with. This day captivity will be broken and your song will be, \"only God can do this\"!! It is time to go forward into the miraculous!",

You don't have to bear the shame of your sin, for Jesus bore it all at Calvary. Many in the Body of Christ are weighted down, heavy with the shame of feeling unworthy. Wonderful spiritual medicine.",

Most of this pain comes from family issues broken marriages the heart break of a wayward child and betrayals. There is a pathway of pain that God will allow us to go through so that we might be used to bring provision and life to others. If we are to represent Christ in our generation there will be an incredible personal cost. The key through this pain is forgiveness. When we withhold forgiveness from those who have hurt us we begin to starve the work of Christ. The same people who betrayed us will come back to us one day empty hurt and starving. Will you choose to forgive them and allow them to experience the mercy of God?",

A stubborn person has an inner flaw and this inner flaw doesn't show until they are called to put all they are in the hands of God and walk in obedience. A stubborn person can appear humble, zealous and even excercise spiritual gifts, but there comes a certain point they can't get passed. They can't lay down their inner thoughts of the way things should be done and surrender to God's ways. God will allow a sense of emptiness come into our souls to get our attention. He is looking for a sincere heart to submit to the authority of His Word. When we choose to obey Him the power of sin and decay is cancelled in our lives. The only way out of stubbornness is to HUMBLE ourselves before God.",

God in His mercy will prepare a trial that will lead us into a type of the sufferings of Christ. This crisis will cause us to be awakened to prayer, and in this time God will throw overboard everything that hinders us from His power. The moment we surrender and yield our life to God's purposes, His mercy will begin to flow in us and through us. The Holy Spirit will give us the courage to stand in the midst of adversity, and speak life into others around us who are perishing.",

These are Christians who focus on material provision for the satisfying of their own desires. They are masters of their own destiny, choosing their own course, thus becoming their own god. Embracing the truth is about eternity and when we don't embrace truth we become imposters in the house of God. The imposter will create his own covering and create his own righteousness. The Holy Spirit is calling His church out of the sin of compromise and to come under the covering of the blood of Jesus. God is calling you out today to cover you and to take away your shame.

When we have a proper perspective of Christ we will reverence His presence, and stand in awe of the fact that He comes into our homes and into our heart.

When Jesus rose from the dead His resurrection life became available to all who would want it. If we are going to be blessed of God there is a journey involved. This journey will lead us to a place called Bethel where we are separated for the purposes of God. We will also be led to Jericho where we learn to trust God to break down every stronghold the the enemy has erected. As we walk with the Lord being one at heart with Him, He will anoint us and give us power to bring life into barren places.",

With this new nature of Christ came a deep inner longing and a groan that was put there by God. This inner groaning leads us into the depth of the life of Christ. We groan to become the new creation that God has intended us to be. Satan's most potent tactic against the righteous is to get us to feel that somehow we have fallen into disfavor with God in times of deep inner troubling, when in reality something more deep is going on inside of us. God by His grace will put a groaning in our heart to know Christ in His power and Truth and nothing but CHRIST will satisfy us.",

God's Kingdom is a NOW Kingdom and He beckons us to leave behind what we once trusted in, let go of all our baggage, and slip through the eye of the needle!

The Pentagon - the symbol of invincible strength, burned by fire. There are pictures in society in the news papers of people given to self gratification, addicted to drugs, obsessed with wealth, publicity and fame only to be lead to an early grave. Could it be the Lord is putting before us a picture of what we are becoming as a society. Thanks be to God that there are other pictures that God desires to use to show to society. If you are in a dungeon of darkness and despair God is preparing you to be a picture to this society. Pictures are developed in a dark room.

Whatever you give your time and attention to the most is what is influencing your character and is becoming your idol. Too many go to church, going through the motions on Sunday and the rest of the week devote themselves to their own pursuits and pleasures and wonder why they can't feel God's presence. God desires to dwell among his people. But when they don't like to retain the knowledge of God, when they prefer an appearance of godliness with no power it will lead to destruction.",

We must come to the Lord with a WHOLE heart - and not TRY Him, but SERVE Him, because He is GOD. Many do not get through to God because they are seeking their own agenda, or their own personal well being rather than the purpose of Christ. The reason so many walk in confusion is because of this refusal to submit to God. Why do Christians not pray as they should? Are they not totally surrendered to following Jesus? Do they not understand the heart of God and his love for them? This unjust judge had authority in Luke 18 over this widow woman's adversary, and she knew her rights, and she did not give up. The devil accuses us, pointing out our faults, and God avenges us by giving us the very thing we lack, when we seek him for it. God delights in his children and will rise up to deliver them when they are under attack.  Another wonderful encouragement to prayer.",

            "description": "October 21, 2007 - When the church of Jesus Christ begins to portray a wrong image of God, it opens the door for uncalled and unfaithful men to take positions as spiritual leaders. The end result of standing before the wrong image of God will lead the people into a theological perspective that is based on human optimism as opposed to sacrifice and truth. The true image of God represents Jesus Christ, the Cross , His sacrifice and all that is Holy. If we are going to know the true image of God, we will be led to a place where we are undone, where everything that we thought we were has to die. We must take joyfully the spoils of all of our religious goods and come before this image of the TRUE and Holy God. It is only in the presence of Jesus Christ that we are turned from image to image by the Glory of God.",

The serpent will not take us but rather we will take him up and whatever death the enemy has caused us to swallow it wiil not harm us.

These are all good things but God's call for greatness is higher. If we don\u2019t have the love of God all these things count for nothing. We are called to put away childish things such as grievances, unforgiveness, envy, pride and anger and begin to love others like Jesus loves us. This is impossible to do without the power of the Holy Spirit. Christ in us gives us the power to go beyond human limitations into the supernatural love of God. The indisputable evidence of a great church is the love we have for one another. It is something of God working in us and through us.",

After the captivity in Babylon, many of Israel had grown comfortable and stayed, rather than returning. Mixture in the world gives the enemy room to rise up and rule over you. Esther fasted and prayed, but she then had to get up and go to the king. We, as the Body of Christ, need to remember we are ambassadors of Christ, and there is no time for games. Jesus is coming, and we need to come out from among the world, and seperate ourselves for his purposes. If you are struggling with your flesh, this message will help you, and hopefully motivate you. Esther risked her life to intercede for her people. We need to risk whatever will come into our lives whether persecution, or trouble, to be seperated to God's purposes.",

It doesn't mean we don't have struggles or failures, it means that these things no longer govern our lives.

There is a vision of God that comes into the heart of a man or woman when they stand before the throne of Jesus and pray, \"use my life for the souls of this generation\". There is an incredible joy and provision when our heart is one with the plan of God. God will be faithful and avenge us speedily of the self focus in us that hides the image of Christ. In these last days whose image do you reflect? It's time to shine for Jesus!",

There is a great danger of having the gifts of God without the heart of God. God is calling us to a militant love that declares, \"I AM my brother's keeper\".",

God is calling us to return to Him, deny self and bring provision to the poor and needy, the downtrodden and those that are struggling.

When we do this, we are separating ourselves from the Spirit of God and we are operating with our natural senses. God's spirit will not strive with man and He will not share His glory with anyone.

When the man  is found by the neighboring citizens, clothed and sitting at the feet of Jesus in his right mind, instead of rejoicing at his deliverance, they reject Jesus, and ask him to leave for they are unwilling to follow him if it means losing their pigs. Many are unwilling to trust their life to Jesus, and are holding back part of themselves, unwilling to surrender, having counted the cost and the price too high.

In times of calamity it is our human tendency to focus on ourselves and withdraw our hand from the needy around us. As children of God we are admonished not to withdraw our hands in self preservation, but rather to stretch out our hand to the poor and needy. There is power in our hand to do good because Christ's hands stretch forth through us to offer comfort and consolation to those who don't know Him!",

This is the reason why there is such a powerless testimony and the church is becoming a non issue in this society. We cannot be devoted to the Lord and be devoted to the things that offend His holy name. God is calling His church to come outside the camp and come out of mixture and compromise to serve the Lord wholeheartedly.

            "description": "August 9, 2009 - The concept of being a servant that is not highly esteemed today as we live in an age where our theology in the church at large seems to have focused on personal gain, social gain, power, influence, authority and individual greatness. The Bible says that Jesus took upon Himself the form of a servant and in doing this He teaches us that heavens order is completely reversed from the world's order. The Word of God is performed in those whom have a servant's heart. Serving Christ and then serving others unlocks power and revelation. You may feel trampled, pounded, unappreciated and passed by but as a servant you have found the secret of spiritual strength! Take heed; the last will be first and the first will be last!",

            "description": "This is a powerful message about the church of Laodicea and much of the Western church of this day.  The message is centered on the verses between Revelation 3:14 to 3:22  Carter also uses verses from Mark chapter 4 to show the disciples fearfulness and lack of concern for others when they were in storm with Jesus in the boat.  The church of Laodicea had the same lack of concern for others with the self-centered life that they were in.  In Isaiah chapter 58, the message speaks of the fast that God has chosen instead of the fasts of pretence that the people of that time were doing.  Like the church of Laodicea, the people of Isaiah\u2019s day were living life for themselves with no concern or grief for the poor or suffering.  With these verses the message went into a parallel with much of the church of today that looks for self-help books, or seminaries, or even counseling without seeking God or God\u2019s word for problems.  Carter encourages married people with problems to look to Ephesians chapter 5 for an answer to problems instead of the counsel of someone who suggests that all your problems are from your third and forth generation.  The message ends with words about revival using the revival of Ezra where it speaks of the people weeping. Revival has a strange mixture of weeping and joy.  In revival the hearts of the people are broken and there is remorse.  The church of Laodicea did not weep for others.",

The church that forms a false image will not endure when hard times come and they will abandon the journey of Christ to follow their own agenda. God in His mercy will allow this false image to be broken in pieces so we can go back to God and do things His way. When we are left with an empty shell and a cry in our heart that says, \"God I am nothing apart from you\", God will respond by filling us with His glory. If ever there is a time to cry out for the Holy Spirit to fill us it's now!",

            "description": "Carter\u2019s main point in this message is that when people come to Christ, they come as honest people, admitting who they really are. Two of Carter\u2019s examples were people that had failed.  One was the high priest Joshua, standing before the throne of God in filthy rags had failed to build the temple.  The word picture about Joshua is a typical picture of Christ putting robes of righteousness on the sinner who comes to him.  This priest in filthy garments, who stands before the throne of God and then being given clean garments is compared to a Christian, who in the honesty of who he or she is, comes to Christ and receives garments of righteousness..  Another person of failure was Jacob at Bethel, who in being a liar, really didn\u2019t have the blessing until he admitted who he really was. In other words, when these two people came to and end of what they could do, they admitted their failings.  Carter\u2019s main text was in John 1:45, where a third example was the honest man Nathaniel.  Nathaniel recognizes who Christ is when Christ describes Nathaniel by stating that he is a man of no guile who he saw under the fig tree.  Nathaniel recognizes Christ when hearing this because he knew that Jesus was describing something that could only by said by the Messiah.",

He points out there is a similarity in both Psalms except for the beginning verses.  Carter\u2019s main point is that in David\u2019s maturity he became a man of a fixed heart and is singing a song of victory in Psalm 108 instead of singing out a song of circumstances and difficulties in Psalm 60.  In this message, Carter brings out promises that are in types that were given to David and are of course given to us too.  We can wake up having a testimony of a fixed heart and singing a song of victory instead of waking up singing a song of our circumstances and having a testimony of the troubles around us.  We can sing a song of victory and have a testimony of a fixed heart if we can realize that we have promises that God will give us the victory through Jesus Christ.",

It is a systematic religiousness that made His ways unrecognizable to mankind. The wrath of God is truly revealed when He sees man create a system of religion that robs the sinner of the treasure of His heart. The whole desire of God is that His house would be called a house of prayer, and the doors would be open so the outcasts of humanity could come in and find satisfaction to the deepest desires of their heart. God is calling His church to get out of the board rooms and into the prayer closet and cry out to Him to ignite us with the fire of the Holy Ghost and begin to move in His power one more time. Can we believe God to cleanse the temple one more time and awaken His church?",

This is one of the best illustrations of the Lord Jesus Christ-it's not so much a sermon as a verbal portrait painted with love and care of our Lord that every Christian needs to hear. It will change how you deal with others and it will forever change how you see the Lord if you listen with an open and hungry heart.

This is a real eye-opener on prayer. Just as the religious Pharisees were ineffective and uncaring for the lost, with no real compassion, today many Christians are caught up in worldly things, while their family and friends are lost,  too busy to pray as they should. Jesus said his house should be a house of prayer and we are the temple of God. Are we houses of prayer? Do we pray as we should?",

Part of his bride is wayward, and does not spend time with him, and only seems to love him when it is convenient or doesn't cost anything. The longing in the heart of the Lord to bring again those who have drifted away is astonishing and will amaze you as Pastor Conlon reveals the mercy and grace of our Lord.",

Spiritual awakenening is when God speaks and He has free course in our hearts and there is no resistance to His voice. When God finds a heart that does not resist His spoken Word the miraculous starts to happen. He speaks with intelligent speech and the power behind His words begins to shape and reshape our lives. If we are truly His and have given ourselves to the Lord we don't resist what He speaks into our hearts, but rather embrace it as the highest way of life. God is calling us to believe what He has already spoken and wants us to bind ourselves to His Word by faith.",

Carter also describes what Jesus has done at the cross with his death and resurrection in taking captivity captive along with Psalm 149 to describe a Christian\u2019s victory over Satan because of what Christ has done.  The sermon is titled The Written Judgment Of God because of the judgment that is written against Satan in the scriptures.  Satan no longer has the power keep a Christian in a place of defeat and cause the Christian to cut himself with thoughts because of the past.  As Jesus said, \u201cIt is finished.\u201d  These past sins have been removed as far as the East is from the West.",

The enemy will come and lie to you accusing you, telling you God sees your flaws and has withdrawn from you. Hannah began to fast and pray, so desperate for God to birth something in her that she was willing to give it back to him if he would. And he did. We can appropriate this lesson for our own lives.

There is a moment in everyone's life when God will come and whisper His truth in our hearts, that ALL THINGS ARE POSSIBLE when Christ is at the center of our lives. God has the power to break us into pieces and consume us, and He would be be completely justified in doing so, but it is not in His heart to do so. Christmas is a season that reminds us that no matter how many times we fail Him, He sent His son Jesus to carry us through our journey. God walks with those who walk with Him. He restores, He gives strength, He gives hope and provision. This season we are lovingly reminded that the supernatural life of Christ is entwined with the natural life of man and we become a new creation. This Christmas listen to the still small voice of Jesus and let Him fill your heart with JOY.",

            "description": "Carter starts this message out at Isaiah 24:10 where the word speaks of a hard time that is to come. He uses this verse then different verses\\ with the disciples in boats during storms to show the need of having to learn a lesson of faith. In this message Carter shows how God allows his people to go through hard times so that they later are able to trust the Lord in the situations that they will go through in the future. Paul\u2019s life was also used in a parallel to the disciples to show how God uses trials to mold the people of God. His points are that there is a coming storm that God will allow and it is those people that learn trust in the current trials that they are going through that will be used in this future storm. The people who will be used in the future storm are the man or woman of God that can say {I believe God} when the storm is happening.",

The heart of Christ is to minister to and serve others, and he wants us to share his heart. The devil is trying to destroy the Body, going after the weak and the young. We are to watch for our brothers and sisters, and if we see them in a battle, we must be willing to fight for them. To go into the secret closet and war against this thing on their behalf, to love not just in word, but in deed. Selfishness has disastrous consequences. Take heed.",

When the Son of God knocks on the door of your heart to put what you know about Him into practice, how will you respond? We are called to take everything God has given to us and use it for the betterment of human suffering. This doesn't make sense to the natural man who will choose self preservation and stay locked behind a closed door fellowship. If you reach out to the widow and the hungry in a time of famine, the treasure of Jesus Christ will be unlocked to you. When we turn our hearts away from helping the poor and needy, we rob ourselves of the presence of God. Jesus stands at the door and knocks and if you will open the door He will give you provision to feed the hungry, clothe the naked and touch the heart of a sin-sick world. Let your heart come into agreement with what God speaks for your life. If you have resisted this call Jesus is willing to knock again.",

When our will and affections are set upon our fallen nature we will become an offense to Christ and we will be tempted to pursue a coarse that will lead to ruin. To be a disciple of Jesus we must be totally abandoned to the Will and Purposes of God and follow the PATHWAY that He has chose for us.

This is where Peter, James and John where when Jesus invited them to go into Gethsemane, just a few hours before they had pledged to the Lord that they would not desert Him even though He Himself had told them they would scatter as sheep without a Shepherd.  The power of the Holy Spirit was not yet given and so Peter was moving in the flesh, he didn't see where the resources for maintaining a close walk with Jesus would come from.  But it is through Christ that all things are made possible to us, all the purposes God would have us to accomplish can be met as long as we realize our own weakness and abject need for Christ to live His life through us and that this can only be done by complete reliance on Him for the resources.",

Carter points out that a Christians life of self denial involves continuous change and that it is important not to rely on past or present people, places, or things. We go from glory to glory and there is a constant need for change. When Christians refuse to change, they stay in secure places and do things even in worship that that are the way they have always done them. Churches that that once had fire can become dead by not changing. Carter went to Rev 2 with the church of Ephesus as an example of a church without change leaving it's first love for familiarity. Carter used the example of Peter getting out of the boat to walk on water of a person who gets away from the security of familiar circumstances to follow the Lord's bidding. Hebrews 13;14 Was quoted early by Carter, \"We have no continuing city\".",

We must begin to understand that God will answer the cry of His people. There is a season when God Almighty will arise to defend the rights of His own name. We are living in a time when God will fight for every soul who longs to be set free and follow after Christ.",

True value is not in embracing the things of this world but embracing the life of Christ and doing what He has called us to do. In these last days God will bring the truth of Christ back into focus through His church. When this religious system sees the children of God who are empowered by the Holy Spirit and walking in the joy of Jesus, then many will turn back to the Lord in this generation. Religion will forever bend its knee when there is a God-gripped people in the midst.",

There comes a time when God doesn't have to speak anymore because you already know what He wants you to do. God says put away the old man and put away the old nature. He is seeking for a man after His own heart who would simply walk in obedience with Him. Are you embracing something that God has clearly told you to put away?

When we sit under the true preaching of God's Word and then embrace a lie, sin and religion become friends. It is that inner struggle that we all have to face from time to time when we come to a minimal understanding of the ways of God, and yet in our own heart we think we might know a better way than the one God has planned for us. There is incredible power in the deceptiveness of the human heart. God is calling us to be single focused and to agree with His truth so that our heart will not be veiled with the deceit of religion. When we turn, with all of our heart, to the Lord, the veil is lifted and our lives become a testimony of His goodness and power.",

When was the last time you raised up your hands to God and thanked Him for what He has done in your life and His faithfulness? Tears of gratitude refresh Jesus. These tears come from a genuine work of God and a worship that remembers where He brought us from and that He is the source of my work.",

The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom and this wisdom is understanding that God means what God says. We can not alter His standard. The Bible clearly says if we forgive each other He will forgive us, but if we will not forgive others neither will He forgive us. Many of us will never grow in Grace because we are not willing to forgive those who have wounded us. Forgiveness is not an option it is a commandment from God. Jesus Christ has provided everything we need to forgive.",

However, when we begin to leave the single pursuit of gloriying God and begin to find pleasure in this world your heart will turn from truth.

When the pursuit of the people of God does not differ from the pursuits of a perishing society around us God will withdraw His presence from us. When we are motivated by the desire to be glorified of men, and our focus is on titles, positions and prominence, we will create a man-made glory. Jesus speaks to these ministries and calls them an abomination and says that they will fall under a curse. There is a day coming when the true church of Jesus Christ will stand up against these false prophets. God will rise up and deliver His people. God will reveal Himself to those who are grieved at what is being done to the name of Jesus and grieved at the way society is living without God. These Christians are not spiritual giants, they simply love Jesus and have a passionate desire for Him to be glorified in these last days.",

One of the final traps of Satan on these Christians is to bite our hands and infuse us with his poisonous logic. It's always been Satan's desire to either have man withdraw his hand from being extended on God's behalf, or to distort the image of God's hand as He is revealed through man's hand. For those of us whose hands have been bitten by the very people God has sent us to help, God is saying DONT GIVE UP. God is calling us to a militant forgiveness so that God's hands will be extended through our hands to reach a fallen world. The weakness in our hands will be strengthened by the resurrected Hands of Jesus Christ.",

How do we get free from this? How do we experience peace on earth and goodwill towards man? The answer is the gift of Jesus. God in the flesh burst forth into the visible because humanity had no way out! This is the message of Christmas. He came with a display of compassion for our weaknesses and nailed them to a Tree.

The heart of the message is about the need for each of us to walk in meekness in order to lead others to Jesus.  The meek man Moses could not lead the children into the promised land, because of one instance of anger.  There is a warning to us in this example.  We can miss the opportunity to lead family, friends, and others to the Lord by one instance of walking out of the character of Christ.  Carter used Mathew 11:28 when Jesus said, \u201cI am meek and lowly of heart.\u201d  Carter also used Mathew 5 Jesus said, \u201cblessed are the meek\u201d but the main text he used was the story of Moses hitting the rock in anger and the inability of Moses to then lead others into the promised land.",

God will leave these trials in our life to train our hands for war and to cause us to depend on the power of the Holy Spirit. We need to understand our enemies are already defeated but we still need to go to Jesus to get the resources and to stand in faith. If we lose sight of God in these trials we will turn to human reasoning and begin to follow our own sensual nature and desires.",

How do we turn from sin? We turn from sin when we return to Christ and allow a living loving God to envelope us and break the power of sin in our lives.

Prayer is simply knowing the mind of God and moving forward in faith with Him. We can come boldly with an honest heart and agree with what He has spoken to us until He brings it to pass.",
