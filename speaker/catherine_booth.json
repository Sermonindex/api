    "description": "Catherine Booth (1829 - 1890)\r\nListen to freely downloadable audio sermons by the speaker Catherine Booth in mp3 format. Was the wife of the founder of The Salvation Army, William Booth. Because of her influence in the formation of The Salvation Army she was known as the 'Mother of The Salvation Army'. She became a partner in her husband\u2019s work and soon found her own sphere as a powerful preacher. She also spoke to people in their homes, especially to alcoholics, whom she helped to make a new start in life. Often she held cottage meetings for converts. She eventually began to hold her own campaigns. Many agree that no man of her era, including her husband, exceeded her in popularity or spiritual results.\r\nCatherine Booth was eloquent and compelling in speech, articulate and devastatingly logical in writing, she had for over twenty years defended the right of women to preach the gospel on the same terms as men. At first, Catherine and her husband had shared a ministry as traveling evangelists, but then she came into great demand as a preacher in her own right, especially among the well-to-do. A woman preacher was a rare phenomenon in a world where women had few civil rights, and no place in the professions. Catherine Booth was both a woman and a fine preacher, a magnetic combination that attracted large numbers to hear her and made its own statement about the validity of women\u2019s ministry.",

It wants something to eat, and many \u2018Christians\u2019 give it a stone! But God is raising a people who know what the world wants and how to give it, who know how to break the bread of life, and testify what God has done for them. You are called to preach the gospel by the need of the world. Set yourself to work for God. Go to Him to ask Him how to do it. Go to Him for the equipment of power and then begin. Never mind how you tremble. Your trembling will do more good than if you were ever so brave. Never mind the tears. I wish Christians would weep the Gospel into people; it would often go deeper than it does. Never mind if you stammer. They will believe you when it comes from the heart. Get filled with the Spirit, and then go and let it out upon the lost. Go and stretch yourself upon the dead in sins, and breathe into him the breath of spiritual life. Go and touch his eyes that he may see, and speak to the dead and deaf with the voice of God and make them hear. Look the lost in the face and take hold of them lovingly by the hand and say, \u2018My friend, you are dying, you are going to everlasting death If nobody has ever told you till now - I have come to tell you \u2019.",
