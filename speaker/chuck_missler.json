            "description": "Esther is a facinating book in the Old Testament, it does not mention God in any obvious way but His hadn of prservation over the Jewish people is seen in a very dramatic way.  In a historical sense the events in Esther took place between Ezra chapter 6 & 7.  It starts with king Xeres of Persia in his winter palace preparing for a huge 180 day long feast just prior to him going to war with the Greek empire. During the feat the king commands that the queen be brought beofre him and all his naoble men who are there, the queen however refuses to come for reasons which are unknown, this angers the king greatly as it sets a very bad example to his lords and also to everyone in the empire, so the king decides to find a replacement for the her.  After a search is conducted he choses Esther, a jewess who was the neice of Mordecai one of the kings lords, and a descendant of Kish, king Sauls father.  Mordecai discoveres a plot to kill the king and informs Esther the queen who tells king and the conspirators were killed probably by impaling, but Mordecai received no reward.. yet.",

            "description": "Haman is 'the bad guy' of the story of Esther, interestingly he was the descendent of Agag king of the Amalekites, a man whom king Saul (of whom Mordecai was a descendent) spared against the will of God, it is interesting that if Saul had obeyed the Lord in wipoing out the Amalekites the events of Esther might never have taken place, there is an important lesson here in that our disobedience toward God may have far reaching consequences beyond our own lives.  Haman was promted to be the 'prime minister' of the Persian empire and this everyone had to pay ho9mage to him, which they did, all except Mordecai and Haman was greatly angered by this and sought revenge, not just against Mordecai but against his people, the Jews.  Haman went to the king and lies and asks that all the jews be killed in a holocaust fashion, the king doesn't check the facts but agrees and a decree is sent through all the empire.  Mordecai is greatly troubled by this and mourns and tells his niece Esther, the queen, that she has come to her place of status for sucha time as this.",

            "description": "After 3 days of fasting a prayer Esther puts her life on the line and goes and sees the king without his permission, which was a capital offence.  The king shows her mercy and asks what her request is, she asks that she would prepare 2 banquets for the king and Haman.  This was a great honour for Haman, who is overjoyed by it, so they have their banquet and the king asks again what Esthers request is, but again she bides her time.  Haman on his way home sees Mordecai still mouring and is greatly angered that he still does not honour him.  That night the king is unable to sleep and asks for the chronicles to be read to him, in this he discovers that Mordecai has saved his life and not been rewarded yet.  So the king asks Haman what should be done to the man whom the king wishes to honour, Haman thi nking the king means him advises him how and the king commands that Haman honour Mordecai!!  If this wasn't enough for Haman the day after Esther exposes his plot to the king to kill her and all the jews the king flies of into a rage and demands Haman be killed on the very instrument of execution that he had prepared for Mordecai. A problem still remained however the empire had declared that all jews should be killed on a certain day and that day was looming.",

            "description": "Haman, enemy of the jews,is now dead but that doesn't mean that the Israelites are safe.  The king could not stop his own edict due to the laws of the Persian empire.  Mordecai was made prime minister of the whole empire and so was given the task of resolving the issue by the king.  He set about this by creating new laws that would protect the jews on the day they were set to be massacred.  So when the day finally came that all the jews should be killed they fought for their lives and were helkped by the authorities.  At this time approximately 76 thousand people were put to death throughout the whole empire spanning from India to north Africa but the jews did not take any of the spoil from their enemies.  At this time Hamans 10 sons were also put to death and their bodies hung up in order to disgrace them, this finally meant the end the Amalekites, whom king Saul had disobediently spared hundreds of years prior.",

            "description": "The name Esther means 'something hidden', Martin Luther argues that the book should be removed from the canon of scripture and one of his main reasons was that the book doesn't even mention the name of the Lord, but Luther was wrong because Esther does mention the name of God it's just encoded in the text.  The Bible is full of different codes from equadistant letter sequences to macrocodes, the Word of God has depth which can never be fathomed, the interesting point about some of the codes is that encoded words are always found in passages where the plain text bears some relevence to the encoded word, a phenomenon which is unique to the Bible.  The Hebrew name for Jesus, Y'shua is found in the Old testament over 5,500 times including all major messianic prophecies and even to the extent in Isaiah 53 encoded in the text is 'Yshua is my name'.  Incredible!  Another interesting point is the title Pilate wrote and placed on the cross above the Lord 'Jesus of Nazareth, King of the Jews' where in Hebrew the first letter of each word spells 'YHWH' the unutterable name of God that He revealed to Moses.  Definitiely a message for anyone interested in Bible codes.",

            "description": "Macrocodes are hidden codes within a body of information that are encrypted within over a wide section of the information, within the Word of God they are better known as types.  Dr Missler puts forward the argument that the book of Esther is not only a facinating and dramatic narrative but is also as story of our own redemption.  The book starts with the king (who represents our soulish nature) and his fall and seperation from the queen (the spiritual side), but the king searches out a another queen and is united with her, unknown to him though is that the new queen Esther is a child of adoption to Mordecai the Jew (who represents the Spirit of God).  Haman and his sons represent the flesh and the works of the flesh respectively, interestingly the meanings of each of Hamans sons names is a different attribute of the fallen nature of man, whether indepence or self righeousness etc.  Using the types that Dr Missler puts forward we have to ask who rules within us, is it Haman (the flesh) or Mordecai (the Spirit).  Interestingly the king is unaware of Haman's true intent until he is exposed by the Esther, Haman is deposed and later put to death, as the flesh must be as the flesh can perform many 'godly' works but will never surrender as long as we are this side of eternity, and Mordecai given rule of the empire.  Who rules in our hearts?",

The 'core' sin of Israel was idolatry, but it was not their only sin far from it.  The Lord chose Hosea's marriage to illustrate how He felt toward Israel, His adulterous wife. the Lord commanded hosea to marry a woman of whoredom and shows Hosea before hand what she will be like toward him.  Each of their childen God then names, again as an illustration of how He felt toward Israel ie the children were the result of a relationship where the husband loved the wife but the wife went away to other men. The first was named Jezreel, which is a place in Israel where there has been great bloodshed and will one day be the location of the final war battle Armageddon. Hosea's other children children showed how the Lord for a time would judge Israel and not show mercy to them for they were no longer considered his people, hence they were called Lo-ruhammah (no mercy) and Lo-ammi (not My people).",

This is reflected in Hosea's adulterous wife Gomer and his faithfulness and love towards, the Lord had blessed Israel greatly and they had turned and praised idols for their blessings, so the Lord promises to send judgement on Israel in order to turn them back to Hi, and that is exactly where Israel are today mostly away from the Lord. Chapter 3 of Hosea has been described by some as the greatest chapter in the whole Bible quite a feat for 5 verses.  Gomer is up for auction as a slave and Hosea buys her back with all he has, he then takes her home and reclothes her.  This is exactly what the Lord has done for us, where we are obviously in the place of Gomer and Hosea in the place of the Lord.",

Chapter 5 deals with the punishment for their crimes Hosea prophesied the Israel would fall and later on Judah would fall too, this is exactly what happened even though Judah were given 100 years longer than Israel.  The Lord passed judgement on Israel.  The final verse in chapter 5 is of particular note as it refers to Christs first coming as it mentions the Lord going and the returning (to Heaven) and returning again until Israel acknowledges their sin of rejecting their Messiah and then He will return to them.",

Israel will realise that their years of affliction have been disciplinary in nature in order to bring them back into the loving arms of the Lord.  There will be a time of great tribulation for the nation of Israel that will culminate in the second advent of the Lord Jesus.  The rest of the chapter gets back into the teritory of God's charges against Israel, these include exploitation, injustice and the most abominable sexual sins, it is again more evidence of adulterous attitude of Israel toward the Lord, but also shows how we are toward Him aswell in running after our 'idols'.",

Israel in Hosea time, like our society today, believed that right and wrong were relative concepts thatcould be correct for one person but not necessarily for another, this is of course is utterly wrong God is absolute and He defines right and wrong.  Several of the kings of Israel were assasinated and hence surrounding the ruler there were many men with blood on their hands, Israel had put it's faith in the neighbouring nations and not in the Lord.  Because they had cast god away He would cast them away.  They had replaced the service of God with a dead religion and so thought they could atone for their own sins and because of this God would not even accept their sacrifices to Him.",

Hosea predicts that Israel would be scattered among the nations until the Lord regathered them into the land as only He could do this.

The prophet began to discover that at the very heart of the almighty Creator was love and that God is love.  The Lord shows how His heart was torn for His people as He did not want to judge them but His holiness demanded it.  So judgement had to be prescribed upon the nation as they had commited idolatry in Bethel (the house of God) and this was a forshadowing of the abomination of desolation. We know that ultimately the Lord's love and justice met when His wrath was poured upon our Lord Jesus on the cross of Calvary.  How only His precious blood could atone for the wrong of not just Israel but for all of us.",

He shows them that He is their only Hope but they have stubbornly rejected Him and so their Saviour would be their Judge. Hosea beseeches the people to return to the Lord and repent. The Lord states that He will restore them to Him after they have repented, and the Lord would wonderfully take them back to Himself.  The prophecy of Hosea finishes with the ultimate repentence of Israel and turning back to the Lord and the Lord's acceptance of them which will herald the Second Coming.",

Jude shows how evil works are the result of apostacy just a James shows that true good works are the result of true faith. Interestingly the name Jude means Judas, which of course is a name synonymous with treachory and apostacy.  From the first few verses we discover that Jude was the brother of James and most likely the brother of Jesus Himself, we also find that he had originally intended to write an encouraging letter but was constrained by the Holy Spirit to exhort his bretheren to contend for the faith.  He had to do this because apostates had crept into the church of Jesus and were denying the foundational doctrines of the Lord.",

We see the typology associated with the wilderness wanderings, such as Israel's baptism in their corssing the Red Sea, the manna they ate was the bread of life and the Rock they drank from was Christ.  When the people loathed the bread they were attacked by snakes and had to look upon a brass serpent on a cross which Jesus Himself said was type of Him.  Dr Missler also discusses 'Kingdom Now' or 'Dominion' theology which tries to set up the Kingdom of God on earth which of course will not happen until the Lord returns.",

In Genesis 6 the scripture recalls a period in history when the 'sons of God' which in OT times was always translated 'angels' married human women and had monsterous children known as the Nephilim or 'fallen ones'.  He states that this was the sin of the angels that lead to them being imprissoned and probably to the flood in orer to completely destroy the monsterous offspring.  Intersting stuff.",

The sin of Sodom was the condoning of such widespread and abominable sin within the cities gates, which was not only homosexuality.  Back in Genesis, Abraham had interceeded for the cities and the Lord had been merciful but the only people to be delivered from the cities was Lot and his family although hid wife of course did not survive due to her emotional ties to the cities.  It is interesting that Jude mentions this incident in a letter about apostacy as this means that Sodom knew the truth and turned from it, becuase the truth is revealed to all of through creation itself.  So these apostates act as they want, deny authority and speak evil of dignities.",

From other scriptures we learn that Michael the archangel is almost always associated with the nation of Israel and this leads Dr Missler into the idea that the dispute was to foil the Lord's plan regarding the two witnesses in Revelation 11, as Moses is believed to be one of the witnesses as his ministry was interupted, as was Elijah's, the other witness.  Interestingly even when Michael was on a mission from the Lord doing His will, he doesn't rebuke Satan directly but rebukes him in the name of the Lord.

Cain thus offered the works of his own hands which told God that His way was not good enough in Cains eyes and this was blasphemy.  Balaam was a prophet who was paid to curse Israel, but the Lord would not allow him to prophecy against His people so Balaam counselled Balak in how to get Israel to sin with the daughters of Moab.  Korah rejected the mediator between God and the people of God who was at the time Moses, this was rejection in type of the Lord Jesus, which came with penalty of Korah and all those who rebelled with him going down into Sheol alive.  From what happened to these three we see the high price of apostacy.",

And yet Methuselah is a model of the Lord's grace because he is oldest man in the scripture. Interestingly some rabinical sources claim that Methuselah died one week before the flood, just when Noah entered into the Ark, we do know from the scripture that Methuselah died in the same year as the flood.  Enoch confronted the apostates of his day and some signs of apostacy are murmering, just as Israel did at the beginning of Jude, complaining as the angels did, and going after their own lusts just as Sodom and Gomorah did.",
