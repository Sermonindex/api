    "description": "C.L. Culpepper (1895 - 1986)\r\nListen to freely downloadable audio sermons by the speaker C.L. Culpepper in mp3 format. Was a Southern Baptist missionary to China and experienced part of the Shantung Revival in China during the 1920-1930's. When the Communists took over in China, Dr. and Mrs. Culpepper and their children were transferred to Hong Kong where Dr. Culpepper served as treasurer of the Hong Kong Baptist Mission.\r\nWhen Miss Monsen greeted them at the door, her first words to the Culpeppers was a question, \u201cBrother Culpepper, have you been filled with the Holy Spirit?\u201d The issue of the filling of the Holy Spirit, also referred to by the missionaries as the \u201cbaptism in the Holy Spirit,\u201d served as a major theme of the ensuing revival, as the missionaries reported it. Miss Monsen related to the Culpeppers scriptures related to healing, particularly James 5:14-16. Mr. Culpepper said that \u201cthe words \u2018confess your faults\u2019 particularly pierced [his] heart\u201d. Confession of sin and an emphasis on consecrated holiness is another phenomenon that characterized the revival.",
