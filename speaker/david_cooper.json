He speaks on the sequence of election on how God has foreknowledge of the choices men make. There is much to be learnt from this sermon by any believer from any theological background. Note: comments about brother paul washer are made in their local church setting and is not way meant anyway to slander to demean this brothers name. SermonIndex.net fully supports and promotes Paul Washer's messages, there is much to be learnt from brother Paul no matter what theological backing you may be.",
