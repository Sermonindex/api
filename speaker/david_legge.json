            "description": "Pastor Legge begins with some very sobering stories about the apathy that is rampant in the world today and also sadly in the hearts of those that are His church. The spirit of apathy could, according to a leading scholar, be the very thing that brings our society and that the epitaph of our society will be \"This society died because it just couldn't be bothered\". This spirit is seeping into the church and we see the contrast between it and that man of God the Apostle Paul. He shows how we will not be able to win souls until we have wept for souls and our own apathy has been nailed to the Cross.\r\n\r\n[i]All material by Pastor Legge is copyrighted.

            "description": "\"A Time To Cry\" - a time to cry. Solomon said in Ecclesiastes chapter 3 and verse 4: 'There is a time to weep, and there is a time to laugh; there is a time to mourn, and there is a time to dance'. In some quarters of the church there is a great emphasis today on laughing and on dancing. Today it seems that the church, God's people, sleep instead of weep. They are merry instead of mourning. I do not believe that the church today, especially in the West, is living in a day of laughter and in a day of rejoicing. They might feel themselves to be, they might have been spellbound like those in Galatians chapter 3, where Paul could say to them: 'Who hath bewitched you', who has cast this spell, hypnotised you into believing something as it is not? I believe that, for the child of God today, our day should be a day of weeping and a day of mourning. I believe that it is a time to cry.\r\n\r\n[i]All material by Pastor Legge is copyrighted.

Pastor Legge puts forward the frightening but necessary question can we be sure of our salvation and walk with God if we are at ease with a dormant church and a dying world all around us.  Have we forgotten that the Gospel is an offence and a stumbling block and shouldn't be sugar coated in order to administer to people, we are to be about our Fathers business like our Lord, David just before he slew Goliath asked the terrified men around him 'Is there not a cause?' \r\n\r\n[i]All material by Pastor Legge is copyrighted.

He shows that during revival we can see 5 five key stages, the first is that the people in the revival read they're Bibles avidly, second they understand what the Word of God is saying to them, third they obey the commandments of the Lord, fourth lost truths are recovered and obeyed both in form and principle.  Finally the people of God will rediscover strength and endurance for the work of God because 'the joy that is the Lord's is their strength.'\r\n\r\n[i]All material by Pastor Legge is copyrighted.

Pastor Legge tells how only 1% of the total money donated to missions goes to the nations where the majority of people have not even heard the name of Christ, but 87% goes to already evangelised and, so called, christian countries. He shows how we have turned the Great Commision on it's head as again only 1% of the total money donated to missions goes to the evangelism of the Jewish people. Christ has purchased with His own blood the very vaccine that this sin sick world needs and yet we who have it seem so reluctant to administer the cure.

Those that are eternally damned cry that God would Send believers out into the harvest, Lest their own loved ones should join them in the pit. Pastor Legge shows how we need to have a deep compassion for the world around us.a dn also how we need to travail in prayer with almighty God until we prevail. the question remians do we have the 'Ear of faith' to hear the Cry from Hell?\r\n\r\n[i]All material by Pastor Legge is copyrighted.

The great white throne mentioned here is great because of the Great Judge that sits upon it, He is the the Lord of lords and King of kings, the Lord Jesus Himself.  The throne is white because of the purity of Him who sits upon it who cannot even look upon sin His eyes are so holy. In this passage we hear of His face from whom everything, even the great expanse of the cosmos flees away, except for the unrepentent sinnner before Him.  Here at the great white throne everything will be revealed even down to the idle words they spoke, the fearful thing about this court room is that after the judgement there is only eternal Hell.\r\n\r\n[i]All material by Pastor Legge is copyrighted.

            "description": "In this sermon Pastor Legge shows how Paul was a master soul winnner, and illustrates the methods he used.  Paul was a man wholely devoted to Christ and His gospel even to the point where he would refuse to be supported by the christians around him so that none could say that he preached the gospel for any other reason than to glory Christ his Lord.  He was a man who chose to become 'all things to all men that he might win some' enslaving himself so that he could reach more and more diverse peoples than anyone else at the time. A man who was utterly consumed by the necessity to preach the gospel.\r\n\r\n[i]All material by Pastor Legge is copyrighted.
