    "description": "David Platt ( - )\r\nListen to freely downloadable audio sermons by the speaker David Platt in mp3 format. Dr. David Platt is the pastor of The Church at Brook Hills, a congregation in Birmingham, Alabama. David\u2019s first love in ministry is disciple making\u2014teaching God\u2019s Word, mentoring others, and multiplying the gospel. \u201cI believe that God has uniquely created every one of his people to impact the world,\u201d he says. \u201cSome may count this view as idealistic, but I believe it is thoroughly biblical\u2014rooted in Psalm 67:1\u20132, yet found in Scripture from beginning to end. God is in the business of blessing his people so that his ways and his salvation might be made known among all people.\u201d To this end, David has traveled throughout the United States and around the world, teaching the Bible and training church leaders.\r\nDavid has earned two undergraduate degrees from the University of Georgia and three advanced degrees, including a doctor of philosophy from New Orleans Baptist Theological Seminary. Prior to coming to Brook Hills, he served the seminary as dean of chapel and assistant professor of expository preaching and apologetics and was on staff at Edgewater Baptist Church in New Orleans. He is the founder of Radical, a resource ministry, dedicated to serving the church in making disciples of all nations. For more resources visit the media centre on the Radical website.",

Towards the end, he gives a powerful plea and exhortation to his own church, and poses the question, :Are we going to be a church that stops the mission of Christ or Obeys it?",
