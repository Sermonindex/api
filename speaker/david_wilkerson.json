Are you offended by Christ? We pray and doubt that God can hear us, or answer our prayers. so we have unfulfilled expectations. God responds to us, \"You are offended by the way I am bringing about my kingdom\" You have need of patience after you have done the will of the father to receive the promise. David Wilkerson says, \"I am so glad that God didn't answer my prayers in the way that I asked him! I would not be here!\"  One thing that John did well, was to take his doubts to Jesus.  Jesus reaffirmed him of who he was and pressed him further, \"...blessed is he who is not offended because of me\"",

Jesus would not have asked the Father to send us a Comforter he knew we wouldn't need. We need to know why he was sent, why he dwells in us, and allow him to do what the Father sent him to do.",

            "description": "David Wilkerson speaks about the perversion in America and the sinfulness of the church. He points out how the church today is married to the world. People are seeking places where smooth messages are being preached. Christians no longer want to hear about God's coming wrath and the necessary correction of their lives. This broken and God-fearing man denounces the passivity of God's people. Christians are blind to the lukewarmness and the sinful mixture that has crept in little by little. He warns how the spirit of blindness is the least recognizable thing. He calls believers to leave their passivity: \"You have lost your fight. That's all the devil wants to do is get the fight out of you and kill it. So you won't labor in prayer anymore, you won't weep before God anymore. You can sit and watch television and your family goes to hell. If you are expecting somebody else to win your family or to do this work you are mistaken.\" Through this very deep, challenging and anointed message, God calls believers to a baptism of anguish and to fervently pray for the recovery of a nation.",

The hardest part of faith is the last half hour and just before the victory we give up turning away from God with a evil heart of unbelief. God will lead us into places where we are shut up and nothing short of a miracle will get us out of the situation. It is in these places of hopeless crisis that God will come through to glorify His name. We must stand on the promises of God with a heart full of faith declaring that God is faithful. Pastor Wilkerson examines the lives of Saul, Solomon and Samson as men of God who went into a crises of faith and failed the test. Our faith will be tried, as by fire. If your faith is being tested, you should listen carefully to this message.",

The world sees a church splintered by division, into numerous denominations and differences in their interpretation of scripture. Too many refuse to fellowship with one another because of their differences. Their is no scripture to condone such division and denominational loyalty. There is one Lord, one faith, and one baptism. A convicting message on dealing with our prejudices. By the way believers live their lives they represent Christ to the world who watches with suspicion. Peter had a hard time dealing with the acceptance of the Gentiles, and learning to share God with them. The Jews had long held the belief God was theirs alone. The Lord revolutionized Peter's and the apostles' thinking when he gave the Holy Ghost to the Gentiles, too. May he revolutionize ours as well. This is one of the best messages on unity in the Body of Christ, and the need for it, ever preached by anyone.",

God promises that He will BE GOD TO US, we must trust Him and take Him at His word. God wants a simple determined faith that believes and takes hold of His promises.",

Wilkerson uses many scriptures in this sobering, yet very accurate message on the lack of prayer in the church. Many will fight for prayer in their schools, yet do not pray at home. Hard times are coming before the Lord comes for his people, and those who do not pray won't be ready or able to face it. People are too busy to pray, they praise the Lord but don't pray to him. He is a stranger among them in his own house. Convicting!!!!",

Often times it may well just be one area that remains but nonetheless folks continue in that sin.  Wilkerson preaches a very personal message here and he shares his heart and shows his own weakness as an example.  The consequences for a Christian continuing in sin are sobering, but he gave us what we needed to overcome sin, if we want to. For those who are sick of their sin, and hate it, and cry out to God, there is wonderful news. He will empower you, and he wants to put his fear in your heart so you will not turn away from him, and then he can take you into the fullness of the new covenant. Powerful preaching, with a gentle compassion for those who are struggling.",

That he is able, faithful and willing to do what he said he would? If we do, then why don't we pray or believe like we should? Why do we not cast our cares on him and leave them there instead of picking them back up and trying to do it ourselves? Bro. Wilkerson examines the passage in Jer. 17:5 \"Cursed be the man who trusteth in flesh\".\u00a0 This is a very important message for all. True faith in God results in an abiding peace and rest in your soul. When we haven't learned to trust God, he will bring us to a place of depth to train us to trust him no matter whats. God wants us to be prepared to trust him. He wants us to learn how to depend totally on him for everthing, completely surrendering to his will. Then comes the calm and rest.",

God will not fail you, he will not turn you over to the enemy. Israel couldn't believe or accept the love God had for them, causing an entire generation to perish in the wilderness.

We have such a blessing and powerful promises in the New Covenant. God shows us through the law that we can't keep it, we can't be obedient, in our own selves, BUT, he made provision for us through the Holy Ghost being sent to empower us, and live the life of Christ in us, and working mightily through and in us to make us what God wants us to be. The image and likeness of Christ. When we give up trying to do things our way, recognize Jesus saved you from your sins, and when you fully submit to the Holy Ghost he will give you dominion over sin, by faith. A wonderful exhortation on the new covenant.",

This is a title that is misused today and Wilkerson explains that in detail. This is a powerful message about the \"new thing\" God is doing in His Church. He is removing His Presence (though a \"feeling\" might still remain) from the idolatrous, and bringing those whose hearts are longing for Him in TRUTH into a \"new order\" -- that is, God's order. This new thing is not about success, prosperity, or a world-wide \"revival.\" God is stirring the hearts of His people (a remnant) into Holiness and righteousness and Truth. This message brings the blessing of God into the right perspective.",

God is raising up a people who are committed to him and his cause who are a holy remnant, and who are steadfast and sure of their God. Eli was judged soft on sin and allowed wickedness in the tabernacle at Shiloh; even his own sons. Today, the church world is a laughing stock because of wickedness in the house of God, there is no power or spiritual authority, no presence of the Lord in many churches. But there is an unseen remnant of people, who would surprise you, because they are not prominent, or well known, but they are shut in with and hearing a word from God. And the word is prepare, for judgment is coming.",

In these seasons we have a tendency to question God's faithfulness and doubt that He will answer our prayers. When our problems go from bad to worse and the answer doesn\u2019t seem to come, there is a bitterness that begins to rise up. We can do one of two things. We can either turn to the Lord and trust in His Word or charge God with \"Fatherly negligence\". God knows and cares! We have a heavenly Father who knows about agony so much so that He allowed His own Son to die on a cross and suffer so that we may be comforted in all our afflictions. God Knows and God Cares!",

He also saw God reduce Satan's empire into rubble in an instant. God saved the best wine for last. He's pouring out his spirit and those who seek his presence are feasting on wonderful things. Yet too many Christian homes are not a place where Christ's Spirit is presently manifested and God wants this to change. Only Jesus' manifest reality will melt Satan's bondage on your lost loved ones like wax. A wonderful message revealing just how God is going to deal with the enemy of our souls that will rejoice your spirit!",

He lovingly explains about the warfare we have to fight our way through to pray, and reveals even if we have neglected to pray as we should, God still wants us to come to him, and he will by the Holy Ghost teach us how to pray as we should. For that alone is how we learn. So stop beating yourself up and get alone with the Holy Spirit and ask him to teach you to pray.",

I believe it to be preached in the 60's and the recording was taken from a Record LP so there will be some background noise of the record due to quality. In this message wilkerson addresses the deplorable situation in American homes and gives an urgent call for people to wake up and start to really live as a family should live. This message is counter-cultural and against the spirit of the age of progress and technology, simplier times are and were better. I am sure many families will take much of the simple application into everyday life.",

The devil tries to weary God's people with a constant barrage of lies and accusations, meant to wear them out, to exhaust them and take the fight\u00c2\u00a0and the faith out of them. If he can convince you God is mad at you or doesn't care about your situation, he has already won half the battle. Faithfulness to God can only come out of a trusting, believing heart. the devil knows this and tries to hinder and discourage you with lies as you begin seeking to enter into the rest of the Lord, and spiritual blessings he has for his children.",

Sexual crimes against children, abortion, greed and corruption will bring about sudden destruction that will change the world in one hour. Christians should be grateful for this world and the life God has given us here but we are not to live in fear of death. If we lose the fear of death through trusting in Jesus, we will not fear the sudden destruction that is coming. The bible says in the midst of these calamities a song is going to rise up from all the saints. In the house of God there will be a revival. In the middle of the fire, God's children will not be in panic but in an exuberance of praise to the majesty of Almighty God. All saints from the uttermost parts of the world will break out in song of Hope and Praise.",

The second call is, \"You make a move\"! The Bible says, \"today if you hear His voice harden not your heart\". Jesus is coming soon, so get up and shake yourself form the dirt and when you rise up the shackles of captivity and sin will fall off!",

He empowers us by the Holy Ghost to be able to keep his word when we are willing to surrender our heart to his Lordship. A stirring word that will cause every sincere believer to examine his or her own heart. John 14:15 says if you love me you will keep my commandments.\u00a0 This is just the first of many other scriptures Brother Wilkerson uses to demonstrate the reality of what it means to love the Lord our God. It goes beyond feelings and sentiment. It involves more than your words. The Lord is looking for hearts that honestly reach out for him and has a desire to be obedient to his word.",

God is pleased to wait until all striving and human effort cease and your situation calls for nothing less than a miracle. God knows the day and the exact hour that He will intervene. In the midst of these dark seasons while we are waiting for Him to act trust that the Holy Spirit is standing by ready to take action. God is calling His people to abandon themselves to prayer and praise, believing that He is still on the Throne and He is in control! In the day of darkness Jesus Christ is still the light of the world!",

Jacob lied, and stole from his brother, but he had a contrite heart. Even though throughout his life he endured many trials, God was with him, all the way. Throughout the 14 years he spent working to marry Rachel, conflict with his fatherinlaw, conflict between his two wives, fear of his brother, his daugther being attacked, and his sons committing murder, to the disappearance of Joseph, and the famine in the land that arose later, God kept Jacob, and his family, and they were never in any real danger. In the end, Jacob's testimony was, \"at 130 years old, few and evil have the days of the years of my life been. \" (Gen. 47:9).  Many are the afflictions of the righteous, but the Lord delivereth him out of them all. Ps. 34:19",

God is looking for individuals who will wait on Him until the Holy Spirit is poured out. God often allows afflictions as an act of His love to bring us to our knees and cause us to bend our heart to His submission. In the secret closet God wants o replenish us and give us His covenant of peace. In these last days God is going to pour out a spirit of prayer and supplications with a supernatural enablement to pray.",

The face of God is His reflection and His likeness. This is a call to get to know who the Lord so we can live like Him. To seek the face of God is to receive the knowledge of who He is , how He acts towards mankind so that you can spend your time seeking Jesus in your everyday situations.",

It is a message on the prayer, praise and worship that goes before the Lord.  If you have a fear of conviction or a desire to remain lukewarm or cold, this is not the message for you. This sermon examines the \"dark side of prayer\" -- that is, God's response to prayer from impure hearts and unclean hands. Prayer from an unrepentant and selfish heart will produce judgment rather than stopping it. The starting point for the message is God's judgment upon Nadab and Abihu in Leviticus 10 for offering \"strange fire\" on the altar of incense. This is a must-listen in this day of frequent calls to prayer -- prayer without repentance will do nothing but hasten judgment.",

Jesus warns there will be a time of great distress and men's hearts will fail because of fear. When we begin to understand the times we live in, God will send His Spirit to wake up a luke warm church. God is calling His church to allow the Lord to conform us into His image. The message to the Church is that we are to walk worthy of the Lord in all wisdom and knowledge. We are called to pursue intimacy with Jesus and to love one another tenderheartedly. Through faith we will conquer the devil and all his wiles. God will keep us standing tall in the midst of this darkness. The Just shall live by faith.",

Out of Genesis 18, Wilkerson preaches on the sins of Sodom and Gomorrah and puts this in a message for this day and age.  He lays out the comparison of then and now.

Violence was rampant, and their sexual perversions were not hidden. Their sin reached unto heaven and God could no longer keep silent. God decided to destroy them, but he was looking for someone to turn away His fierce wrath from them. Our society today has surpassed Sodom and Gomorrah in sin. God's judgement is surely coming, even as Billy Graham once said that, \"if God does not judge America, He will have to apologise to Sodom and Gomorrah.\" Lot lived amongst them, but was no testimony. His only concern was for his own safety. He wanted to be saved, and considered the others beyond hope. Many Christians today live similar lives. They consider the homosexuals, rapists and murderers beyond salvation. They pray God's judgement upon them, and not for their salvation.",

God never intended for His people to live in fear. God is a God who pleads the cause of His people.

Faith must go beyond believing for the provision of God, faith must reach the very heart of God and His purposes. The heart of this message tells us our present battles are not about testing or chastening, it is what God is doing in our hearts to prepare us for service in eternity! We will rule and reign with Christ and in the ages to come we will show forth His glory. God has a larger purpose than just this world.",

The time will come when it will be unlawful for anyone to claim that salvation is through Jesus alone. No religion has a problem with the man Jesus. The One World Church that is coming will actually be united under the name \"Jesus\", but it will be the man Jesus. The man Jesus the Hindus and the Moslems can accept. The good man, the prophet, the teacher. The name \"Jesus\" will hold them all together. As a result, people will think the One World Church cannot be so bad since they focus on Jesus. It is another Christ that some preach, but there is only one resurrected Jesus. The crucial question is: \"Is Jesus Christ the only name under Heaven by which man can be saved?\" The moment we compromise on the exclusiveness of Jesus Christ, the Spirit of God departs. We have no more reason of being here. Make up your mind today whether you will stand or compromise when persecution comes.",

Jesus said you would know the truth and the truth shall set you free. Sanctification is the Spirit of Christ in us making us to become what God in reality sees you to be already, by faith. Making us what we could never be on our own, holy. The gift of righteousness is the Spirit of Christ in you. When you yield to him and let him have control, he makes you what he is. The Lord doesn't want you to come to him in condemnation and guilt. He wants the truth of his righteousness and his love to set you free.",

David Wilkerson preaches one of his greatest messages while suffering with the flu.  You will hear him struggle through this message but in his weakness, God made him strong.

One that understands that God is love and also understands loving God with all of your heart, soul, and mind.  Through his love, God showed us his human face. Many have an inaccurate concept of God and who he is. God wants us to know he loves\u00a0us, and that he revealed himself to us through Jesus Christ. To know Christ\u00a0is to know God. Everything Jesus\u00a0did was to reconcile us to God. When we sin, we do not need to run and hide from God in fear and shame, suffering under condemnation and guilt. We need to run to him for\u00a0forgiveness. We must believe him, and come to him so he can lift our burden and reveal himself to us. He knows what is\u00a0best for us and wants a relationship with us as individuals.",

I believe it to be preached in the 60's and the recording was taken from a Record LP so there will be some background noise of the record due to quality. In this message Wilkerson deals with the problem of our minds and allowing them to entertain sinful thoughts. This is a very practical message preached to youth but is very much needed to be heard by many in our day. This message will help people who have any sinful thought life that needs to be sanctified and cleansed by the blood of Jesus Christ.",

Wilkerson did much study of husbandry, inspired by the Holy Spirit to search this out. God wants his children to be bearing the fruit of righteousness-ever increasing in Christ-likeness. John 15 tells us about the pruning that all Christians will go through during their walk in and with Christ.  It is God\u2019s purpose for all of His to bear good fruit and part of bearing good fruit is the pruning process.  Learn the divine destiny of each and every Christian from past to future.",

You can hear the wailing and weeping of people as God's spirit begins to convict and deal with peoples hearts. God called Moses and the 70 elders to come up to the mountain into his presence to meet with him. \"They all saw the God of Israel;\" (24:10), and they ate in his presence, and did drink. (v. 11) But only Moses was allowed to meet with God, and called on up further. The others were told to wait. But they did not. This message deals with the issues of the heart that hinder or prevent us from going all the way and answering the wooing of the Holy Spirit to come out from among them and seek the face of God.  [i]NOTE: First 15 minutes of this message is worship in slovak. And the message is intrepreted to the people in slovak.[\/i]",

We see that those of Zadok are righteous and concerned with holiness while those of Abiathar are concerned with gain and \"minister to the people's idols.\" The text ranges through the ministries of Zadok and Abiathar in 1 and 2 Samuel and finishes with Ezekiel's vision of faithful Zadokite priests in God's new Temple (the Body of Christ).",

The devil will send foxes to hinder our fruitfulness. Jesus will come and call us to rise up with Him and He will battle for us and go after these foxes.

When we choose to wait in the Lord the Holy spirit will bring our focus back to Jesus and winning lost souls. When the Holy Ghost comes down there are three evidences. First, He will renew our hunger for the presence of Jesus and put an expectation in our heart. Second, there will be an outbreak of gladness that is indescribable in its power. And last, the body of Christ will be awakened to the coming of the Lord. Our prayer will be, \"Come Lord Jesus, come!\"",

God's heart is set on His church, in spite if all the apostasy and false teachers, He will not allow the Cross of Jesus Christ to be in vain. The Lord is calling us to complete confidence in the remission of sins. God's plan for us is not to walk in guilt and condemnation, He is calling us to enjoy Jesus and trust in the Power of the Blood of Jesus. When we embrace this we will come into truly find rest in Jesus.",

When we mix our prayers with faith, they will work.  To neglect prayer is to neglect God and the salvation he gave us. To not take advantage of the access given to us through the blood of Jesus is to take it lightly and do despite to the grace of God. Now more than ever the church needs to be praying.",
