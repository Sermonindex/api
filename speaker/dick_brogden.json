My dad and mom are my heroes (still missionaries on the field, they went out in 1966) and taught me to love Jesus and love his passions in the earth. I married my best friend, Jennifer, and she is stronger and wiser than anyone will ever know. I have two joys in life\u00e2\u20ac\u201dmy sons, Luke and Zack. Together we have treasured Jesus among Muslims since 1992, first in Mauritania, then Kenya, then Sudan for the past 15 years. The next treasure stop is Cairo, Egypt.\r\n\r\nJennifer and I love to pioneer, we love working among unreached Muslim people, we love taking the gospel where it has not yet gone. The picture Jenn has had for our lives is that of a team on an obstacle course. We run to the wall first and get down on our hands and knees so others can spring over the wall. We do believe the great opportunity of our age is to engage the world of Islam with our magnificent, divine Jesus. We do consider the Arab world to be the heart of Islam. As Jesus is enthroned in the Arab world, we will be that much closer to every tribe, tongue, and people in worship, that much closer to Jesus coming back to take us all home. Whatever that costs us, Jesus is worth it.",

            "description": "Brother Dick Brogden shares a passionate prophetic cry at the 100 year centennial of the Assemblies of God movement. He calls for a modern missions movement of those who are crucified to self, willing to suffer, and share in the work of the Spirit for the evangelization of the peoples groups in the world. Multitudes are still unreached in the middle east and many other countries, may we share the burden of the Holy Spirit as He is preparing His bride.",
