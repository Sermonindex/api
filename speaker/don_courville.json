Satan will seek to destroy through envy and will use a wolf spirit to undermine authority.  The qualifications of a man, used by God, are a sense of inadequacy, weakness, poor and needy, he doesn't see himself as humble but as he really is, he has total dependence on God, there is no confidence in self, and he has total reliance on the Holy Spirit.",
