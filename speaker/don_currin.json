We have different types of saints: savorless saints (salt-wise), sipping saints (alcohol), and seditious saints (who are likely not saints at all). This message is about the latter, those who cause sedition. God appoints leaders. Insubordination is mutiny against God. Sermon outline: 1. The Danger of Sedition. 2. The Blessing of being under Authority.  3. Proper Servant-Leadership.",

The importance of stirring oneself out of spiritual complacency. Five tests for music: 1. Can you hear the Word of God clearly over the music? 2. Does the music enlarge my vision of the glory of God? 3. Will what I'm listening to produce the fruit of holiness in my life? 4. Does the music communicate sound biblical doctrine? 5. Does the music tend to sedate the mind and make it insensible to God's truth? Contemporary Christian Music (CCM):  Amusing Grace, how sensual the sound, that entertained a seeker like me.
