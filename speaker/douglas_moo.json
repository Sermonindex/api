Baptism is a \"last act of conversion\" where it is more or less a \"sealing\" upon our conversion.  \"Your Christian life needs to be directed by the transforming work of the Spirit within,\" he underscores, \"creating the mind of Christ in you, leading you to live a life that pleases Him and honors Him.\"",
