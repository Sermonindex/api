Smith argues that these drug induced stupor\u2019s are a means of compensating for true spirituality, in the sense that they crowd out the senses God has given us in order that we might choose to enter our prayer closets, reduce our sensory input, and hear from God",

As food is flavored by salts and spices for our pleasure in just the right amounts, so also our conversation ought to be seasoned by just the right amount of salt.  As Christ told the disciples to not waste a bit of the bread he broke, so also he wastes nothing in our spiritual upbringing.  Jesus was perfectly efficient.  He cares about efficiency in his creation.  Smith explains how the human digestive system is obviously the product of incredibly careful thought and intention.   He also explains how the theory of evolution is quite simply wasteful, and inefficient.  Wilder shows that where the digestive system is hungry for nutrients, so also the mind is hungry for meaning.",

Wilder-Smith uses one of his greatest analogies concerning the impossibility of using the scientific method to perceive or interact with heaven and hell.  The analogy comes in the form of understanding that there is no way to interact with a Black Hole, yet we know that they exist by inference.  So also, we are able to interact with eternal realities by inference.  Through this analogy, Smith reveals the lie concerning our inability to scientifically measure heaven or hell to prove it's existence because you cannot scientifically tamper with a black hole in any way yet scientists believe in them just the same.   The second analogy he explains about dimensionality is that a two dimensional person would be incapable of capturing a three dimensional person, because they would always use their higher dimensionality to give their captors the slip.  So also, Jesus gave death the slip.  Smith explains that this life is about preparation for glorification, as the power that comes with a resurrected body would be too dangerous to place within the hands of immoral people.   So if we suffer with him, so also shall we reign with him.",

All existing life exists as a result of information, organized information.  Statistical analysts understand that information does not arise by chance.  AE Wilder-Smith shows in this discussion how to understand information theory, and how it proves creationism to be the only logical viewpoint.  Matter is not self-organizing; it is merely a medium for information.   Smith discusses the classic debate between Bishop Wilberforce and Aldous Huxley concerning the watch-maker.  He shows the fallacy of Huxley\u2019s argument.  If you are not familiar with this debate it is a rather essential understanding in order to unravel the Gordian-Knot of evolution theory.  Smith argues in this teaching how important creationism understandings are because man is accountable to God upon the basis of God being revealed through nature.",

As scientists have attempted to understand how to make a machine that is capable of replicating itself, they have discovered the astronomical amount of information required to make a machine that is not only self-replicating, but also self-diagnosing.  This type of machine is called a Von Neummann machine, and is incredibly complex to develop and requires millions of individual moving components, as well as the information to drive them.  In this analogy we see that man is an incredibly complex machine, obviously designed, and if he\/she is designed, then they are also designed to operate in a certain fashion.  Smith points out that to use our machines in a way that contradict God\u2019s laws is to operate out of our designed ordinances.  When we, as complex Von Neummann machines operate out of our intended purpose then God no longer seems real or meaningful to us in any way.",

How much pleasure must it give the creator when we use the machines of our minds for those intentions which he made them for?  Jesus chose to offer himself as a sacrifice for us so that we could offer ourselves as a sacrifice for him.  Should we not set our face toward that as he set his face toward Jerusalem?",

It is within our psycho-space that we must fill our \u201cminds\u201d with this mind of Christ, which is full of love, joy, peace, patience, and the fruit of the Spirit, as we follow the Spirit, the logos of God step-wise begins to conform us into the likeness of the logos of Christ.

The turtle would not be able to make it to the ocean as a hatchling, neither would it be able to breed by making it back to its home breeding grounds later in life.  It is out of knowledge that God makes us to enjoy the necessities of consumption (food that is).  When we realize that God is a hedonist by nature, and we are going to enjoy him forever, we will worship with a greater knowledge and fervency.",

So also we must recognize that, being made as \u201cgods\u201d (John 10:34) we were given the free will to choose our present condition.  God is not to be blamed for the suffering we have chosen, neither is He to be blamed for the wreckage as a result of it.  Just as our Lord was, so also we need to be perfected through sufferings.  Suffering offers mankind the option to change.  We were cast out of eternity into time so that our decision could be corrected, and Jesus came and suffered for us so that we could be reconciled.",
