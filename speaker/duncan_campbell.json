But again God revived his heart and he experienced the outpouring of the Holy Spirit in the famous Hebrides Revival. The summation of this testimony is very powerful where he asks the listener if God could do this for him why not us? are we willing to 'go through with God' at any cost?",

            "description": "This is not so much a teaching as it is the groanings of a burdened heart to exalt God above man to His rightful place in revival.  Campbell shared several practical \"principles that govern spiritual quickening.\"  The differences between a God-sent revival and the man-centered evangelistic means of his day are truly heart-searching for anyone engaged in work to save men's souls.  Since God's sovereignty does not nullify man's responsibility, Campbell admonished his hearers to be \"agents of revival\" that take God up on \"His covenant engagement\" in prayer and staying close to the heart of the Shepherd.",
