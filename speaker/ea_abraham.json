Abraham shares his testimony of being fruitless in ministry for 10 years and then the Lord started to do the work seeing thousands come to the Lord in Bihar, India. He encourages house churches in the West to share the Gospel and see house churches multiply and disciples made. He speaks on James 1:22 that we need to obey the Lord and the great commission.",
