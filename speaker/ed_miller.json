In the same way, His Church is to surrender and believe that He, by the power of the Holy Spirit, will produce the same miracle of forming the Christian life in us.",

Go after Christ, not the rules, and the good fruit will be produced.  In the account of the widow of Nain, Christ is lord over man's most unsolvable problem: death.  If Jesus can solve the greatest problem, we can be sure He can solve every lesser problem in our lives!",

Though Jesus never visited John in prison, He had a high regard for him, and we can expect in our trials at times not to hear, \"Well done, good and faithful servant,\" down here.  There is a difference between doubting (struggling faith) and disbelieving, and the good news is that God accepts struggling faith as faith.",

You don\u2019t need more surrender; you need a larger revelation of Christ.  If you surrender to one horsepower, you\u2019re going to do a lot of pushing.\u201d",

We can take comfort and refuge in El Shaddai, the God-who-is-more-than-enough, that even our greatest enemy, Satan, is permitted to afflict us only to make us better Christians.
