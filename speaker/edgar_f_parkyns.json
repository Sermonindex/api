Parkyns outlines gospel developments, monastic orders, and adoption of paganism by the 'official church' in Europe (particularly the British Isles), the rise to preeminence of the bishop of Rome, and a renewed interest in the Church about the coming of the Antichrist.",

Parkyns offers an explanation of what the mark of the beast was from the 10th through 17th centuries.  The latter half is the session is left for various questions about the theme.",

He concludes with chapter 12 by unfolding the meaning of the woman clothed with the sun and other symbols.",

He shows how there is a designed pattern and contrast between the false church and the true church between Revelation 17 and 21.  Parkyns describes the exciting historical fulfillment of the first six angels of Revelation 14 and how the final one has yet to call out for a final harvest of judgment.",

The opposition came from the Roman Catholic Church, the new Jesuit societies and within the ranks of the reformers themselves.  The reformed churches slid into the same corruptions as the Roman Church from which they left, but God raised up new men--George Fox, Count Zinzendorf, the Wesleys, George Whitfield and many others to reverse the tide.",

Parkyns unveils the meaning of the woman clothed with the sun, the dragon making war, and other symbols in the chapter, showing the triumph of the Lord Jesus Christ over Satan intermingled with the suffering and persecution that goes on to the present hour.",
