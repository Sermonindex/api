            "description": "Many people today don't know what a family means. Even the president of one of the leading nations in Europe said recently, \"What is a family?\" He's a clever politician, but he's confused about the family. He suggested, \"a man with 2 or 3 wives, or a woman with 2 or 3 husbands\". At his funeral a number of his wives were present. Is there a Biblical standard which is valid today? And if there is, what is it? Here we read that God created man in His own image. They were created in God's image - male and female. He didn't create a man with a harem of women, or like an animal - a bull among the cows. No, He created them male and female.",

Even your selfishness and greed you pass on to your children and they suffer because of you. Turn therefore completely in all sincerity from all sin. It might not trouble you now, but one day it will be revealed and it will be terrible. \r\nBut to those who love God, He blesses to the thousand's generation. A certain newly-born baby simply did not stop crying and the doctor could not find the problem. Eventually he called for a specialist, but still they failed to diagnose the problem. Eventually one of the doctors had an idea, and he took a cigarette and blew the smoke into the face of the child. Immediately the crying stopped. His mother smoked and the child suffered from nicotine-withdrawal symptoms.",

In the Old Testament it ends with the prophet Malachi, after which there was silence for 400 years until John arrived on the scene. God sent John. It is said that he grew up in the wilderness of Judea. There were only five or six small villages in Judea. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re not told exactly where he grew up. We read of the Lord Jesus in Jerusalem, but nothing of John the baptist. He was all the while in the wilderness.

The power of the Lord Jesus is great. However, the devil and demons have power too but limited. But God's power is the greatest, and He has commanded us to go into all the world and make disciples of all nations and teach them to keep all that He has commanded us (Matt 28:19-20). You do not get salvation through education. Education without Christ just produces clever devils. Jesus commanded us to teach the nations, not just to know, but to keep all that He has taught us.",

Genesis 1:26 God wanted man to rule over creation so that man would be the manager of creation. When God created man he wanted man to be like Him. He wanted to put man on earth so that he would represent God on earth. That was the heart of God when he created man. That was the duty of man on earth. When He created man He wanted man to be restored to what he should be.

Billy Graham once said that in the beginning people came with tears because of their sins, but lately they come with smiles. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no true repentance. An evil spirit doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t find rest in the wilderness and then he decides to go back to the one he has left and see how it goes. Then he finds the house put in order and neat and he goes and finds seven others which he met in the wilderness, worse than himself, and they go and inhabit that person. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a dangerous thing to say you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve made a decision for Christ but you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t go all the way but only do it half-heartedly. The devil doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t like it in the wilderness. He wants to stay in a nice place, even in those made in God\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s image.",

She worked herself up emotionally and eventually she shouted (some Christians like to pray louder and louder and work themselves up to a crechendo, thinking that by their sheer volume they will be heard of God. They fail to distinguish between the soul and spirit). An owl in the tree was startled by her crying and let out \"whooo\". She replied, \"anybody, Lord\". Don't be obsessed with marriage lest you end up with a washout of a husband. Let God be your first priority.",

Nehemiah had a cushy job in Persia. His position meant that the King's life was in His hands and he was also an advisor to him. Yet, his concern was for the condition of God's work in Jerusalem. As distant as he was Nehemiah still felt godly zeal for the Lord and His people. We find that he was able to inspire the Lord's people to work so zealously that they completed the rebuilding of the walls in 52 days - humanly impossible but with God, all things are possible.

The cold caused him to want to sleep which is dangerous. Your brain can be frozen. When he woke up he said, \"What\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s happening? I feel warm.\" It was a bear from the forest. A bear is very dangerous. He found himself embraced by the bear. He said, \"Lord, you have sent a ferocious animal to help me.\" When he woke up, the bear also woke up.

            "description": "This is a great matter indeed! The disciples were in the room at night, behind a locked door for fear of the Jews. Suddenly Jesus was among them saying, \"Peace be with you\". Jesus needs no key to enter the room. Even if there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no door, He can go right through the wall. Then He showed them His hands and feet. You\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve heard how his majesty said unashamedly that Jesus is His Lord before the whole world. Jesus said that he who is ashamed of Me, of him I will be ashamed before the Father and His holy angels (Luke 9:26). A certain very prominent judge in Germany has said that if all the evidence and witnesses in the Bible be judged in a court of law, the verdict would be clear that indeed Jesus had risen from the dead! If you refuse to believe after all the evidence had been laid out before you, no wonder that your condemnation in hell will be just.",

If you as a pastor or father in the house wants godly authority over your congregation or children you must have intimate fellowship with God, daily. Abraham had the most intimate relationship with God; and God testified of him that He knew him. A congregation reveals what a pastor is like and children reveal what the parents are like. If you have truly met with God, your one desire will be God's will, and you will live for Him, regardless of your circumstances. Paul was persecuting the church, when the Lord met him on the road to Damascus. His life was changed forever. Within three days he was filled with God's Spirit.",

He has always been. When the Pharisees accused Jesus, He said, \"Abraham rejoiced to see my day\", and, \"before Abraham was, I am\". Sarah took the matter of her barrenness into her own hands and handed her handmaid to her husband as wife. It's a cursed thing for people not to be able to wait upon God. When Hagar saw that she conceived she despised her mistress, and Sarah suffered. She blamed Abraham and Hagar for her suffering which she brought upon herself. But Abraham told her that it's her slave and it was her idea, so she should do what she thinks best. So Sarah made life impossibly difficult for Hagar.

But after 2 or 3 years when I return to visit them again I would find the Christians in disunity. But we read in Acts how the early Christians were of one heart and soul (Acts 4:32). But what I found among the Christians were in opposition to this, the one would criticize the next; the other would complain that they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re not treated well or greeted properly. I knew that revival wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t start if things didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t come right among the Christians first, for the Bible says that judgment must begin in the house of God (1Pet 4:17). The reason the Word of God, the Bible, doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t cover the earth, is not because of the heathen, but because of the Christians that aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t living according to the Word of God. Jesus said that the one who believes in Him as the Scripture has said, from his innermost being will flow rivers of Living Waters. Rivers of water cannot be stopped. You might try to stop a river by building a restraining wall in the river, but the water will only build up on the one side and eventually break the wall in a massive flood, or the water will rise up and flow over the wall.",

But God rose up mighty men of God like Daniel, Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego. And they shook that nation through their lives and testimony and God's Word spread through that nation through their testimony.

We Christians should also always be green. A Christian should always be beautiful. You can read about the beauty of the faith in Gal 5 like love, patience etc. Also go and read the works of the flesh. The fruit of the Holy Spirit in Gal 5:22 speaks of love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, faithfulness, self-control \u00e2\u20ac\u201c these fruit decorate the Christian far more beautifully than the Christmas tree. The Lord said, \"If they do this to me a green branch how much more to those who are dry branches.\" The works of the dry tree are evident: immorality, defilement, witchcraft, enmity, strife, fits of anger, rivalries, divisions, orgies and things like this.

Today some churches still have the tradition to hold this type of feast where the people bring thanksgiving gifts to God. A little boy was present at one of these offerings, and when the others brought their thanksgiving gifts, he realised that he had nothing to give to Jesus. Suddenly he got a bright idea, rushed to the front and got into the gifts basket, saying, \"Lord Jesus, I haven't got anything; but I give myself to you\". This is a sermon to each one of us.",

James continue to say that unless you continue to show by your life that you have the true faith, your faith is worthless. Faith is directional in a Person. Faith not only requires that something is held true, but that Someone has entered into your life. Grasp this secret or you've missed the crux of the matter. Faith is not believing a set of historical facts. All the historical facts about Jesus, that He was the perfect spotless Lamb of God, born of a virgin, died for our sins, was buried and rose again the third day - all of this the demons know to be true, but it doesn't help them. You need a special agreement with Jesus Christ, and then confess that commitment before people publicly. You must believe with the heart unto righteousness and confess with your mouth unto salvation (Rom 10:10).",

We are not exactly sure where they came from because it just says the East but it could have been China or one of those lands there. That doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t trouble us exactly where they were from. But we know that they travelled very far to come to the Kong who had been born. Neither do we know who told them that this Child would be born. It is only the Bible that prophesies about His birth. There were no other historical references. But we do know there had been prophets like Daniel (who had lived most of his life in an Eastern kingdom) and others who had prophesied about it. The Magi saw the star and they said that indicated that the King had been born in Israel. Unfortunately, they presumed that if a king was born in Israel then he had to be born in Jerusalem, the capital. So they started their long journey to Jerusalem.",

The sermon preached to Paul wasn't like so many of today's sermons, where people are told that they should come to Jesus to be happy, joyful, blessed, rich etc. That's why so many fall away. Of course those things could be added but that's not the reason you come to God neither the reason God saves you. God saves you that you might know Him and do His will, wherever He might lead. Someone asked one of the co-workers why he wasn't preaching a Gospel of love, blessedness and material prosperity. He answered that we preach the love of God as revealed in His Son Jesus who suffered and died for us on the cross because of our sin. He died so that we can be saved, do His will and lay down our lives for our fellowmen so that they too can be saved. The man then broke down and answered that he realizes for the first time that he has never been saved, but only followed after other men.",

Who of us haven\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t fallen into sin after being a Christian? One thinks of Esau who sought repentance with tears but could not find it. We need to carefully examine this scripture. We should never take God lightly. A person so easily falls into sexual immorality, or some other sin. And then that person confesses the sin but go back to it a few days later. Such a person is poking his finger in God\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s eyes and his future is not good. What is man that you should be fearful of him? Rather fear God Who can put both soul and body in hell (Matt 10:28).",

He also said that if you get angry with your brother and you call him a fool or other names, then you deserve hell, because before God you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve murdered him (Matt 5:22). It would be good to read this again and again because the Lord expects us to live accordingly. He also said that if someone forces you to walk a kilometre with him, then walk two (Matt 5:41). If someone strikes you on the one cheek, turn the other also (Matt 5:39). Read it prayerfully and ask yourself what kind of a life you live.",

It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a wonderful way of saying it. A Christian is satisfied. You don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t need wealth, possession or worldly pleasures because Jesus becomes your life. Throughout the Bible Jesus is the God of the living and not of the dead. He has risen from the dead. He is not like the spirits of the dead because He sits at the right hand of God. He is not like gods fashioned from wood. He is alive and not an idol carved from wood or stone. He loves you with eternal love.",

Mr Moses Khoza also gave His testimony of how he had strayed from God, but God has shown him grace, granted him forgiveness of sin and even touched him physically. Before he came to KwaSizabantu he was in hospital and had a terrible experience. The people in his ward were very sick. One night he went to fetch himself some water to drink. When he came back to his bed, one of the patients begged him for some water. When he had fetched the water, the man didn't want to drink it, but asked mr Khoza to pour it onto his neck and chest, for he felt like he was burning. After that the next patient had the same request and then the next. It carried on for quite a while. The next morning two of the patients had passed away. God spoke to him through the incident, and he came to KwaSizabantu and met with the Lord afresh.",

They realised that they had sinned grievously, and were totally despondent. And then God's Word turned from judgement to mercy. Consider this carefully, for it is applicable to our day too. There are Christians who have been taken captive and live a defeated Christian life, as we read in Rom 7, \"For what I will to do, that I do not practice; but what I hate, that I do\". They realise and acknowledge their utter desperate state, and have grown despondent. God has pity and feels compassion on His people who have lost their way and acknowledge their desperate state and cry unto Him for mercy.",

            "description": "Last Sunday we looked at the first two verses of Isaiah 40. The message of God's comfort and tender mercy is promised to His people. The continuation and explanation of this grace flows naturally into the next verses. This grace and comfort is through true repentance, as this text shows. When it speaks of the \"voice of Him\" crying in the wilderness it is a direct reference to John the Baptist but is not limited to him, for it is God's own voice that declares this message which brings repentance, faith, and glory (as shown in verse 5). King Herod, in a moment of intoxication and lust promised his lover's daughter (who had eroticially danced at the wine-flowing party) \"up to half his kingdom\". Her mother, with a deep-seated hatred against John the Baptist seized the opportunity to demand his head on a platter. She hated John for openly declaring that it \"was not right for Herod to take his brother's wife\". Nevertheless, the decaptitation of John, did not silence \"the voice of Him\". Even after the death of John this voice continued to cry out; as it does even now.",

To those who love God, all things work together for good. We don't know what the future holds, but we know Him who holds the future. When Jesus departed, His disciples were sorrowful. Jesus said to them, 'It is expedient for you that I go, for when I depart, the Comforter will come - the Holy Spirit'. In verse 2 we read, \"Fulfill my joy by being like-minded, having the same love, being of one accord, of one mind\". God's people can live in this world of sin and in the devil's domain, being 'likeminded, having the same love, being of one accord, of one mind.' It is a foretaste of heaven, when God's people dwell together in such unity. Such a life is completely dedicated to God. That life and Spirit which was in Christ Jesus must also be in you.",

They found common ground in their enmity against Jesus. On the way to be crucified, history teaches us that Jesus was carrying His cross and fell down because He was weak from all the torture. The Bible doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t specifically say that but historians mention it. But the Bible does tell us that when He went to Gethsemane, He took with Him His disciples only to a certain point and three others a little further and left them too and He went still a little further and prayed earnestly, even so that His sweat drops were as blood. He was in a terrific battle, and He prayed and said, \"Father if it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s possible let this cup pass from Me, nevertheless not My will but Your will be done\". That cup was filled with your sin and my sin - the sin of the world. He Who is the Holy Son of God became sin for us! Jesus was fully man and fully God.",

But if the Lord has quickened you, your life should overflow. Spiritually you should live a supernatural, victorious life. God expects it from you and me. In Hebrews 2, Jesus says that He isn't ashamed to call us His brethren. (We say it with utter respect and only because Jesus said it first). We are even called heirs to His Kingdom. As an heir you stand in line for an inheritance. Our life must be different if we truly comprehend this fact. Woe to you if you don't wake up, do His will and live the life He expects from you.",

It was such a fierce battle that even the sun hid its face and there was darkness on earth. Rocks were rent asunder. Satan tried his level best to overthrow the Lord Jesus Christ. Satan was an angel of the north walking among the others in heaven, until pride was found in him and he was thrown out of heaven (Is 14:12-14). A third of the angels in heaven joined satan in his rebellion and was cast out of heaven with him (Rev 12:3-4; 7-9). One cannot grasp it. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s unthinkable that a third of the angel should side with satan. But if one looks at people, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s maybe understandable, when so many people side with satan.",

The tax collectors in Jesus\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 day collected the tax for the government of the day, the Roman government. Nobody liked them. When they taxed people, they would add to the cost for their own pocket. They were thieves, charging more than the government required. And even today there are such people in the world who require bribes for their work. These tax collectors were therefore despised. And Jesus was sitting with them and ate with them! We must be careful interpreting this lest we think that Jesus loves a person that is corrupt and steals from others. And the sinners with whom Jesus ate would include those who divorce, adulterers, drunkards, blasphemers of God, very evil people.",

So he called his chief servant and made him swear that he would not take a wife for Isaac from the Canaanites, but go to his own family and fetch a wife from there. How was this servant to know who the right wife would be? There were so many possibities. Without God it was impossible. But with God it was easy. This matter is very important. If a young man makes a mistake concerning his marriage partner, it will bring him grief for the rest of his life.",

Those whose God He is, they are blessed as well. This blessed man is contrasted with the man that is cursed, in the verses just before these. Here we see clearly the two possible ways that exist in life. Either a blessed or cursed life. There is no middle way. The man that is blessed prospers spiritually. He will bear fruit and his leaf will stay green, even in drought. We do not know our lives ahead. Difficult times might come, but if we are of this blessed kind, we will continue to bear sweet fruit and prosper. It is a great blessing if this life is your desire, and not on your lips only, but a reality in your life. The fruit of such a blessed person is love, joy, peace, longsuffering, gentleness, goodness, faith, etc.",

But in 1966 this Word took hold of me as I read the words, \"he who believes in Me out of his innermost being will flow rivers of Living Water\". However after twelve years of preaching I did not see the rivers in my life. I was at my brother's place and was in a great struggle at night so much that my pillow was wet with perspiration. I longed for God's Living Water like the Samaritan woman at the well. He said to her that if you drink of the Water that He shall give you, you won't thirst again, but if you drink of the water of the world you will thirst again (John 4:13-14).",

Jesus cried out, like an injured buck. What made Him cry out like this? It was because of all the people who claimed to be believers but there were no Living Rivers flowing from their innermost being! One river can change a desert into a garden.

It is not sufficient to confess your sin and not forsake it. You must confess and forsake it. In the sight of God, sin is a terrible thing. Jesus suffered and died because of our sins. He took them into Himself. Even God turned away from Him and Jesus cried out, \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcMy God, My God, why hast Thou forsaken Me?\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 (Matt 27:46). Sin is terrible, and God Who is absolutely holy has no fellowship with sin. He speaks very harsh words regarding sin, like, \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcthe wages of sin is death\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 (Rom 6:23). If you do not part from your sins, you will die. Peter writes that the one who has confessed his sins and goes back again is like a dog that vomits and eats it again (2Pet 2:22). The Bible says that a person who repents and goes back to his sin, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s better that he never repented (2Pet 2:20-21; Heb 6:4-6). It is terrible to go back to your sin after confessing it.",

This was a great experience for Mary and she wanted to share it with her friend, Elizabeth. Elizabeth was upright and served the Lord faithfully. Although Elizabeth was much older than Mary they could share deep spiritual things with one another. In spiritual matters, age does not matter; only one's spiritual state is important. It is a blessing when one's friend walks with God. Then people are united because of the things of God and can bear one another's burdens. However, be careful not to unite with others in evil, like Ananias and Sapphira (Acts 5). Although Mary was only a teenager, she delighted herself in the things of God. She was full of joy because God has finally sent the promised Messiah Who would bruise the serpent's head and bring forgiveness and true liberty. She hid God's words in her heart. The world and the things of the world lost its value, because heaven filled her heart.",

Here was a woman who wanted the best for her son. Do we have such mothers in our midst? She commanded him. She didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t say you can choose whether you follow the Lord or not. You are old enough you can decide who you will serve. She had a zeal in her heart and she commanded him and he had to do it. When she heard that her husband wanted to bless the older son, she immediately said, \"That the blessing must come upon my younger son\" and she said, \"You must obey what I command you to do.\" May God raise mothers again who have authority and say you must do what I command you to do.

When you become a child of God you cannot say, \"I serve Him in my own way - you do your thing and I'll do mine\". Such a person is on the wrong track. When we are born again we become part of God's spiritual family. When Jesus' mother and brothers wanted to speak to Him while He was preaching, He replied \"who is my mother, and who are my brethren?\". Then He pointed to His disciples and said, \"whosoever will do the will of My Father in heaven, the same is my brother and sister and mother\". The spiritual family is much more important than the physical blood family. If your child is not in the will of God, you are far apart from him, while another child who serves God, even not your blood-family, is much closer to you.",

We are told that they will come from the east and west and sit together with Abraham, Isaac and Jacob at the tables of heaven (Matt 8:11-12). But what is shocking is that that passage goes on to say that the children of the Kingdom will be cast out! Every child of God should test and examine himself that he is not counted with those who are cast out of the Kingdom of Heaven. Abraham was 75 years old when God gave him a promise and told him to leave the land of his forefathers. And he left everything (Gen 12:1-4). We can learn so much from him. If we want to follow Jesus, we must also leave everything behind. But his father Terah wanted to go with him. He respected his father and allowed him to go with him. He was promised that although he was 75 years old and had no children, his offspring will be as the stars of heaven (Gen 15:5, 22:17, 26:4, 12:7). Abraham also took Lot along as a nephew and son, since he had no children of his own. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s so easy to make a mistake. Lot was a very nice person and it was difficult for Abraham to refuse. They traveled as far as Haran and settled there (Gen 11:31). God stopped speaking to Abraham until his father passed away. When his father had died, then God spoke again to him to continue (Gen 11:32 - 12:1). When God calls you, don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t take anything along except what God says you should take along.",

As a Christian you must live in victory over sin, the world and the devil, by God's power. If you don't, you will become like salt which has lost its saltiness. Young people who fall into sin excuse themselves that the attraction for the opposite sex is just too strong. No, in the Name of the Lord Jesus Christ, if anyone fixes their eyes on the Lord Jesus Christ, such a person will overcome and be successful. Wherever you go, if you fix your eyes on the goal, your life won't be worthless. A Christian is not allowed to sin, whether it be a small or a big sin in your own eyes.",

But here Jesus speaks of denying oneself and taking up the cross, as if it were two different things. In fact, taking up your cross involves all tree of the points above. What does God say to you personally when He commands you to take up your cross daily? You cannot say that Christ has done everything and you needn't do anything anymore. Here is something for you to do. In Roman times it was a very difficult task to carry a heavy, rugged, wooden cross. Jesus doesn't say that He will take and carry your cross for you, but commands you to take up your cross daily and follow Him. Many people have their idea of what the Christian life is like, but it's as far away as the east is from the west from what Jesus commanded.",

Previously when the king of Assyria came to besiege Jerusalem, Hezekiah went to the prophet Isaiah, and God sent His angel to kill 185,000 from the Assyrian army, and delivered Jerusalem (2Kings 19). His second test was that of his illness. After he had witnessed God\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s miraculous intervention in saving him from the Assyrians he became ill. God sent the prophet Isaiah to him to say that he had to prepare his house for he will die. But he turned his face to the wall and pleaded with God. God saw his tears and heard his prayer and added 15 years to his life (Isaiah 38; 2Kings 20).",

Scientists say that when you look at pornography there are chemicals that are automatically released in the brain which changes the brain in such a way that it alters it's structure. Porn rewires you. Adam and Eve didn't know they were naked, but when they sinned they became aware of it and were ashamed. God Himself then slaughtered an animal and clothed them with the skins. This was a pointer towards the time when Jesus would be slaughtered for our sins on the Cross. The Bible says marriage should be honoured by all and the marriage bed undefiled, for God will judge the adulterers (Hebrews 13:4). Pornography is an evil drug, worse than dagga (marijuana) and many other drugs. Looking at pornography makes you a slave to it. It's easier to stop smoking or drinking than to get free from pornography.",

Islamists like Gadaffi had said that they will take Europe simply by having more children, while Africa will become Islamic. We Christians should stop betray the Lord like Judas. We must remember who the real enemy, satan is. We find the grace of God first mentioned in the time of Noah, in Gen 6:8, \"Noah found favour in the eyes of the Lord\". Way back then Noah found grace in God\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s eyes. Jesus said in the last days will be a time like the time of Noah. There was sexual immorality and flirting around between boys and girls. And it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the same today. It reminds one of the large ship built in Britain, the Titanic. After the construction of that ship, which was at that time the largest ship of its time, one of the builders commented that even God cannot sink it. Many booked for its maiden voyage. It traveled through an area full of icebergs, struck one and sank. Most people on the Titanic drowned. At the moment when it struck the iceberg there was a party going on, but when the news spread that it had struck an iceberg, they changed the music to \"nearer my God to Thee\".",

The intimate protection of God gives confidence and banishes fear, regardless of how great our adversaries. We look to the Lord and in His greatness our problems and adversaries become insignificant. Opposition and outright war did not touch him because his heart was strengthened by the Lord. The psalmist longs for God's temple and expresses the intensity of his seeking after God Himself.

If you as a bridegroom don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have deep roots, you will be uprooted. And that applies to the bride too. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s very deep and one of the most important decisions you will ever make. In our text we read that the Lord is my light, and we need that light as well as His salvation. As you go through life you will meet with many difficulties where all you can do is cry to the Lord, \"please save me from this\". As you meet up with things enough to make you afraid you will need the Lord to be your fortress. And when the wicked come up against you and those that hate you oppose you, then you will need the Lord to be with you that you can overcome. The devil comes in many different ways, not only with his horns and hooves and tail, but also as an angel of light. David goes on to say that even if an army encamps against him he won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be afraid for he is trusting in God.",

For example when you're cut, your body immediately reacts and sends the white blood cells to fight the infection. The dead white blood cells are then expelled as puss. In the same way the Blood of Christ cleanses us from all unrighteousness to counter any poison of sin that enters. The blood is like petrol that allows your body to function. The other members of the body remains in its place, but the blood is present right through your body. The blood also carries oxygen throughout your body. It also gets rid of impurities and acts like a refuse remover. We speak so glibly about the Blood of Christ, little realising what it does. It brings us life and that's why the devil hates it.",

In the Jewish understanding any part of a day is counted as a day and night (and even in our own time measurement, for example if a child should be born at 11.59pm, his birthday would still be counted on that day, and if born the next minute his birthday would be counted with the next day. So whether you were born 12.01am or 11.59pm, almost 24h apart, your birthday would still be counted on that day!). So those three hours on Friday would be counted as a full day and night, according to the Jewish reckoning. Then you have the full Saturday (counting from the evening) and then part of Sunday again (starting in the evening again, counted as a full day and night) when He arose. The full time in the grave would then be counted, as per the Jews way of timekeeping, as three days and nights.",

A very bright, young man applied to teach at a Bible College. He had done very well in his studies. The director gave him pruning shears and took him to an orchard. He told him to prune a tree in the wrong way. Then he waited to see what the young man would do; whether he would follow his knowledge or do what the director had told him to do. The young man did as he had been told and received the post. He was highly qualified but if he had not been able to bow and obey, he would have been unfit for the post. In the College of the Holy Spirit you will not succeed if you do it your own way. You have to be able to obey.",

It doesn't matter that you're given the last rites by a priest or even if all the ministers in the world are gathered to pray for you. A certain man continually got irritated with his wife and children. So he sought a place to be alone where he won't be disturbed. He found such a place but after two or three hours he suddenly realised that the things which really troubled him were within him. You can wash and perfume a pig, but the moment it's left alone, it will go and wallow in the mud. Why? Because it's a pig. So too, if you love the world, you might be in church physically, but the moment the protection is removed, you will wallow in the world, because the world is in your heart.",

The famous evangelist DL Moody preached at the memorial service of someone who was with him in the ministry, Philip Bliss. Bliss was an American composer, conductor and writer of hymns and wrote songs like \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Almost persuaded\u00e2\u20ac\u009d, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Wonderful words of life\u00e2\u20ac\u009d, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Let the lower lights be burning\u00e2\u20ac\u009d, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Hallelujah what a Saviour\u00e2\u20ac\u009d and the melody for \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It is well with my soul\u00e2\u20ac\u009d. Bliss and his wife died in a railroad accident. He was 38. His death was a great shock to the Christian world. Moody himself said what a disappointment it was for him. But he also said that from the time he heard that he was to take the memorial service there was just one thing running in his mind, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153therefore be ye also ready\u00e2\u20ac\u009d. When Kjell heard that u. Friedel was so sick in Switzerland he and his friends prayed for him every day that God would touch and heal him and at one point, Kjell said, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153maybe one of us will go first\u00e2\u20ac\u009d. Moody continued and challenged the audience to be ready before the close of this service. Ask yourself the question, are you ready to meet God?",

There cannot be engagement if the one party says yes and the other no \u00e2\u20ac\u201c both have to agree. God proposes to you, that He wants to be engaged to you.

            "description": "John the Baptist spoke with authority about repentance. Before and after Jesus there were none who spoke about repentance as John the Baptist. From the sophisticated to the lowest people in society were deeply touched by his preaching. They all came into the wilderness to be baptised by him, confessing their sins. They were drawn into the wilderness by the power of God. The world was shaken. People began to ask if he was the Messiah. Eventually the religious leaders sent a delegation to him to ask whether he was the Messiah or Elijah, and by whose authority he baptises. Although he had an opportunity to grab the limelight, he instead gave his honest testimony, \"I am not the Messiah or Elijah; but I am the voice of one crying in the wilderness, Make straight the way of the Lord.\" In this we see a wonderful mystery - he was the voice of Him (God) crying in the wilderness that people ought to repent. It is also marvellous that we do not find a trace of haugtiness in John, when he acknowledges, \"I baptise with water, but there stands one among you, whom you do not know; He it is, who coming after me is preferred before me, whose shoe's latchet I am not worthy to unloose.\"",

When Saul returned from the victory over the Amalekites, he met Samuel and told him that he had performed the commandment of the Lord. He was blind to his own disobedience. Saul killed off the worthless lifestock and that which was despised, but the good and precious he held back. He also let Agag, the most evil of all the Amalekites live. He dealt friendly with him and made friends with God's enemies. But when Samuel saw the brazenness of Agag, he took the sword himself and hewed him in pieces before God.

If God speaks to you, write it down for this is life to a man's whole body.  It is wonderful if a person loves God.  Lukewarm Christians are a nuisance in the Church.  God's words are life and many die because they do not pay attention to God's word.  This is something that we must do continually.  The heart includes feelings, love and desire etc.  People put fences around their livestock.  In the same way, we need to put boundaries around our feelings and desires.  You can't go after everything your eyes sees.  Like Job, you have to make a covenant with your eyes and keep your eyes fixed on the goal or by sunset of the same day, you will already be derailed spiritually.  You'll mess around with young children if you do not guard your heart.",

And then there were those who were just inquisitive, wanting to see what was going on.Along the way there was a man called \"Simon of Cyrene\". When Jesus\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 strength was failing under the Cross, they looked for a person to carry the cross and they got Simon to carry the Cross. He was, according to some Bible commentators, the father of Alexander and Rufus who became members of the New Testament church. He didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want to but he was forced to. He was born in North Africa. Through his carrying the Cross there was blessing upon his children. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a pity when Africans say that Jesus is for the white people. We find so other instances where Jesus identifies with those of Africa, like in this instance, and also when Joseph had to flee to Egypt because Herod wanted to kill the baby Jesus, Africa gave Jesus refuge.",

This text is an inspiration to every believer. The challenge is that the world is in our hands. If we repent and get right with God, our land will be healed and restored. We are not to point to the sin of other people but to ourselves and if we repent the Lord will heal our land. God requires that we humble ourselves. This word was said to Solomon where God said, \"If my people will humble themselves and turn from their wicked ways, I will heal the land.\" Things can be turned around if people have an ear to hear what God says.",

His father Zacharias and mother Elizabeth were well advanced in age, well past child bearing age. But then God revealed Himself to Zacharias that they would bear a son and call him John, meaning the \"grace of God\". The birth of John was prophesied many years before. Isaiah who lived about 740 BC prophesied of his birth and so too Malachi, about 540 BC. One could have a whole sermon on Isaiah\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s prophesy and another of Malachi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s.

The world gets engaged with a party, drinking and boozing, but we as Christians do it in God's house with prayer and in holiness. Some say that there are many ways to celebrate an engagement. Yes, there certainly are many ways to hell but only one way to heaven. The ring the young man gives to his future bride is a token and promise that he will keep himself pure for her until the day of marriage; in receiving the ring, the girl makes the same promise. Young people should live like Mary the mother of Jesus. When the angel told her that she would bare a son, she replied, \u201cHow can this be, since I do not know a man?\u201d (Luke 1:34) She lived a holy and pure life as we read in 1Cor 7:34, \u201cThe unmarried woman cares about the things of the Lord, that she may be holy both in body and in spirit.\u201d",

Yet they promote the sin of Sodom and Gomorrah. Sodom and Gomorrah were totally burnt to ashes that there was not a trace left, and so it will go with those who practice this sin of homosexuality and these preachers who promote this lifestyle and lead others astray. There are so-called Christians who are just like these people in Jude, uprooted trees, wild waves of the sea, without fruit, twice dead. They cast up the foam of their own shame. The blackest darkness is reserved for them forever. Such ministers will reap a double hell, forever.",
