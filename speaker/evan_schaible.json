            "description": "Brother Evan Schaible exposits two grandiose chapters of holy writ and relates them to prayer and revival, both personal and corporate. Using the typology offered in these two chapters, revival is shown to be first personal, and then corporate, and the way of prayer is always the way of the cross. While pointing out many false notions of prayer, the truth is set up and the call for prayer and sacrifice is issued to bring revival that is sent down, and not worked up.",
