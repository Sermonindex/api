            "description": "F. J. Heugel expounds about 4 basic 'laws' of prayer, such as the will of God and the law of faith.  By 'law' he means characteristics or 'the realm of spiritual order' that govern prayer.  '[Even] grace has its mold of operation,' he said.  The practical, straight forward teaching from God's Word is wonderfully illustrated by answered prayers from the likes of George Muller, Watchman Nee and others.

Heugel believes that intercession is the greatest of all ministries, backing up his assertion with Scripture and example, both historical and personal.  He recounted the flame of intercession of the Moravians from which dawned the great movement of worldwide missions and strengthened his position upon great answers to prayer in the lives of Hudson Taylor, C. T. Studd and others.  (Part 1: The Laws of Prayer \/ Part 2: The Ministry of Prayer \/ Part 3: Great Prayers of History)",
