He was inducted into the Acad\u00c3\u00a9mie Fran\u00c3\u00a7aise in 1693 and named Archbishop of Cambrai in 1695. During his time as the educator and teacher of the Duke, F\u00c3\u00a9nelon wrote several entertaining and educational works, including the extensive novel Les Aventures de T\u00c3\u00a9l\u00c3\u00a9maque, fils d'Ulysse (The Adventures of Telemachus, son of Ulysses), which depicted the ideal of a wise king. When this novel began circulating anonymously among the court, having been fragmentarily published in 1699 without his knowledge, Louis XIV, who saw many criticisms of his absolutistic style of rule in T\u00c3\u00a9l\u00c3\u00a9maque, stopped the printing and banned F\u00c3\u00a9nelon from court. F\u00c3\u00a9nelon then retreated to his bishopric in Cambrai, where he remained active writing theological and political treatises until his death on January 17, 1715.\r\nIn Church history, F\u00c3\u00a9nelon is known especially for his part in the Quietism debate with his earlier patron Bossuet. In his work Explication des maximes des Saints sur la vie int\u00c3\u00a9rieure (Explanation of the Adages of the Saints on the Inner Life) in 1697, he defended Madame du Guyon, the main representative of Quietistic mysticism. He provided proof that her \"heretical\" teachings could also be seen in recognized saints. In 1697, F\u00c3\u00a9nelon called on the pope for a decision in the Quietism debate. After long advisement, the Pope banned the Explication in 1699. F\u00c3\u00a9nelon complied with the pope's decision immediately and allowed the remaining copies of his book to be destroyed.",

During his time as the educator and teacher of the Duke, F\u00c3\u00a9nelon wrote several entertaining and educational works, including the extensive novel Les Aventures de T\u00c3\u00a9l\u00c3\u00a9maque, fils d'Ulysse (The Adventures of Telemachus, son of Ulysses), which depicted the ideal of a wise king. When this novel began circulating anonymously among the court, having been fragmentarily published in 1699 without his knowledge, Louis XIV, who saw many criticisms of his absolutistic style of rule in T\u00c3\u00a9l\u00c3\u00a9maque, stopped the printing and banned F\u00c3\u00a9nelon from court. F\u00c3\u00a9nelon then retreated to his bishopric in Cambrai, where he remained active writing theological and political treatises until his death on January 17, 1715.\r\nIn Church history, F\u00c3\u00a9nelon is known especially for his part in the Quietism debate with his earlier patron Bossuet. In his work Explication des maximes des Saints sur la vie int\u00c3\u00a9rieure (Explanation of the Adages of the Saints on the Inner Life) in 1697, he defended Madame du Guyon, the main representative of Quietistic mysticism. He provided proof that her \"heretical\" teachings could also be seen in recognized saints. In 1697, F\u00c3\u00a9nelon called on the pope for a decision in the Quietism debate. After long advisement, the Pope banned the Explication in 1699. F\u00c3\u00a9nelon complied with the pope's decision immediately and allowed the remaining copies of his book to be destroyed.",

He was inducted into the Acad\u00c3\u00a9mie Fran\u00c3\u00a7aise in 1693 and named Archbishop of Cambrai in 1695. During his time as the educator and teacher of the Duke, F\u00c3\u00a9nelon wrote several entertaining and educational works, including the extensive novel Les Aventures de T\u00c3\u00a9l\u00c3\u00a9maque, fils d'Ulysse (The Adventures of Telemachus, son of Ulysses), which depicted the ideal of a wise king.
