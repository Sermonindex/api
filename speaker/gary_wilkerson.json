            "description": "The message is about how to build your Church. Pastor Wilkerson shares the importance of building a Cross\/Christ-Centered Church. The example he gives is Paul's resolve and determination to preach Christ and Him crucified to the Corinthian church -who are much like our present day Church.. Gary Wilkerson(David's son) also stresses the importance of not going the way of corporate CEO like \"pastors\" and following after manifestations and various building projects. Its an awesome message that I'd recommend every pastor listen to.",
