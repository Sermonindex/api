New frontiers, wisdom, and humility all figure prominently. \"It's unlimited what can be accomplished if you don't care who gets the credit\". Unfortunately there are also barriers to be overcome. Manpower can be a limiting factor, especially as the local church learns to focus on the priorities. Money, gossip and prayerlessness are all vices that can immobilize a movement.",

            "description": "Miscommunication can take the best-intentioned encouragement and turn it to discouragement. Therefore love must overrule in all attempts to encourage. Verwer warns of the danger of \"making the narrow road narrower than it is!\" Forgetfulness and extremism are to be avoided. The importance of prayer combined with writing letters cannot be underestimated. Visiting people whenever possible is vital to the encouragement process.",

Some steps to be taken are to focus on biblical, holy spirit filled, balanced leadership. It is hard to get people to unite and stay on course. At the same time intellectual honesty and openess must be maintained. Leadership and serventhood must go hand in hand. A good leader seeking to have loyal team members must take time to communicate with people and win their hearts. Verwer emphasizes that loyalty can exist in a balanced, non-cultish form.",

Some steps to be taken are to focus on biblical, holy spirit filled, balanced leadership. It is hard to get people to unite and stay on course. At the same time intellectual honesty and openess must be maintained. Leadership and serventhood must go hand in hand. A good leader seeking to have loyal team members must take time to communicate with people and win their hearts. Verwer emphasizes that loyalty can exist in a balanced, non-cultish form.",
