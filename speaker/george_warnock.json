This sermon examines Israel's wanderings in the wilderness and shows that God continually led them into situations that revealed their hearts in order to purify them and show his faithfulness to them. It also examines Israel's unwillingness to \"go all the way,\" and reveals God's desire for a people who will love and serve him completely.",
