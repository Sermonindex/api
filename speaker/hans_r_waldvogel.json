He is seeking men and women who worship Him \u00e2\u20ac\u0153in spirit and in truth.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d  And in order to create such men and women, the Lord Jesus Christ has offered us a great and wonderful gift here.  And I would like to impress our hearts tonight with the fact that Jesus Christ has a great blessing: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153If thou knewest the gift of God.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d  Oh, to know that gift of God!",

And of course, He has reference to finding Him, finding God.  \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Ye shall seek for Me, and ye shall find Me, in the day when ye shall seek for Me with your whole heart.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d  Finding God: why, that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the very object of our salvation\u00e2\u20ac\u201dto be reconciled to God.  Salvation consists in knowing God.  How many, many people miss it!  How very, very few people in the world know God! You can tell it when you travel through the world and meet with works and ministers.  The great complaint is like it was by the prophet Jeremiah: the priests knew not the Lord.  How differently they would act and live and minister if they knew the Lord!  How different our conventions would turn out if those in charge knew the Lord!  But why don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t we know Him?  Jesus says, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Every one that seeketh findeth.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d  Findeth what?  Why, findeth God. Are we seeking God?  Are we really seeking God?  Then we shall find Him.  God says we shall find Him.  The very principle of faith is to start out with that knowledge: why, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153God is.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d  When you seek for something that you want very badly, you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re not going to give up until you find that thing.",
