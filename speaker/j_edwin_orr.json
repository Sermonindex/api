            "description": "In this interview, Dr. Orr speaks on the misunderstanding of the word \"revival\". Among other things, he discusses how revival is primarily aimed at the Church, as opposed to the lost. This is the only time I have heard Dr. Orr talk about his multiple PhD's; surely because he is asked in the interview. This interview displays the typical humility of this extremely knowledgeable and well-traveled individual who, though he is surely one of the foremost scholars on the subject of historic revival, offers correction to the modern church, but does so in a way that it is evident he is not trying to glorify himself. The late Dr. Orr expresses his desire in this interview to see revival again, and puts forth his opinion that he does not believe that future revival is reserved for the nation of Israel only.",

He also talks about areas of the world where he believed revival was currently happening, along with some of the mistakes that people have made after revival has occurred.  \"I shudder to hear of people who claim to be filled with the Holy Spirit without any holiness of life.\" Dr. Orr talks about how after years of revival work he kept himself renewed. \"Evan Roberts once said to me 'always pray for a vision to match your faith'.\"",

Orr gives a very informative overview of the beginnings of the third great awakening in American history (which is largely overlooked), starting around 1830, and went on for 12 years. He recounted the events preceding Charles Finney's famous revival in Rochester, New York, in that same year. He explained how 100,000 people were saved as a result of that revival when the town only had a population of 10,000. Orr also defused how false reports of people barking took place on the Frontier, and recounted how greatly the Hawaiian Islands were affected.",

Orr speaks on the awakening that started in 1857 with a prayer meeting in New York City with one man and ended up with the whole city packed out with prayer meetings in churches and auditoriums. It spread all over the nation, so glorious that D.L. Moody said at the end of his life (1899) that we wished to see that happen again in the Church. Orr relates how this awakening and conversions spread to Ireland and South Africa. He recounts an interesting event with Andrew Murray trying to bring order to a prayer meeting! Out of this revival came D. L. Moody, William Booth, Charles Spurgeon and others. The main theme is how through prayer people encountered the presence of the Lord. \"In times of revival, sinners come running to the Lord,\" Orr said. Indeed they did!",

From there he speaks of revivals that it spawned in China, Korea and the great Pentecostal outpouring at Azusa Street in 1906.",

Jonathan Edwards and others called for \"extraordinary prayer.\"  A union of churches began praying, with Boston seeing the beginnings of revival in 1792 and general national revival by 1798.  James McGrady asked his congregants to pray for him in 1799, and showers of blessing came in 1800 on the Kentucky frontier.

What led to this great awakening was a laymen's movement among churches for united prayer for God's outpouring of the Spirit.

Although the revival tide was out between World War I and World War II in America, Britain and western Europe, God was doing great things on the frontiers.  Orr recounts revival in Ireland under Nicholson in the '20's which affected his life.  He recollects personal testimony of being in revivals in Norway, Canada and a localized one at Wheaton college.  Orr closes by highlighting great extended periods of revivals in China and East Africa that prepared the Church to stand under great times of persecution.",
