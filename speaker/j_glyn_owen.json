He speaks of the work of the Holy Spirit in the believer and not simply a holding to doctrinal viewpoints but the life of God through us, His power. God manifests His purpose through believers to see His salvation reach others. He shares that our experience of power with God is not a selfish personal experience but for God's greater purpose. Lastly he ties in the Gospel and shares that this is God's ultimate larger picture beyond our own personal experiences for ourselves.",

It is shown that in our day and age there is a landslide of immortality that overshadows anything that has happened in the near past. Children in society are being raised with high mental and physical standards but morally are being feed sewage in contrast. He gives a very straight forward call for the Church to be that positive agent, saline and different then the world so we can have a positive effect on it morally and bring glory to the name of God. He mentions about Holiness and many other things, this sermon is one of utmost importance to listen to for the nomial Chrisitan in our day.",
