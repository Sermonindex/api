While Paul was affirming the power of real saving faith, James was criticizing the impotency of empty professing faith.

He exposes the spurious type of revival and  shows clearly how true revival begins individually between God and man. He gives  some very pointed statements towards the apathy of the church individuals and gives a clear resounding plea for each person listening to get right with God.",
