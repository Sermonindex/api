    "description": "Jackie Pullinger (1944 - Present)\r\nListen to freely downloadable audio sermons by the speaker Jackie Pullinger in mp3 format. Shortly after her experience of being born-again the Lord called her to take a one-way ticket to Hong Kong, China. Her story is chronicled in the book: \"Chasing the Dragon\" which is a best-seller inspirational missionary story. He has founded St Stephen's Society in Hong Kong that helps serve drug addicts and gives them the life-transforming Gospel message.\r\n\r\nHer burden in ministry has been to show the love of Christ to the hurting and helpless. She saw in the message of the Gospel it had to have a response for us also to go and serve others. She teaches and shows this full-surrender is a simple response to receiving God's love in Jesus Christ.",

They were haughty and did detestable things before me. Therefore I did away with them as you have seen\" Ezekiel 16:49. Jackie gives a short, deep and challenging call to go and minister to the poor with a broken heart. Her message is followed by personal testimonies. The recording ends in weeping over the hardness of our hearts and for the poor. Real ministry is to show people the Lord of the Word: \"They will know what He is like by what you are like. So you live it with your life and they will read you like an epistle.\" Whenever the destitute cry out, God will respond by sending a person, and it could be you. God works through people. Jackie also points out that the poor don't need training in evangelism, as evangelism is simply \"one poor man telling another poor man where to find bread\".",

            "description": "Coming from her own experience, Jackie explains what we pray for when we pray for the Holy Spirit. While trying to reach the lost in the Wall City in Hong Kong, she saw that her approach to sharing Jesus did not work. She was passionate to reach the lost, but she realized she did not have the power to make Jesus known. Her words did not work. This prompted her to seek God and she prayed: \"Dear Lord, please give me whatever it is that helps me make Jesus real to the lost. Because the words don't seem to be working.\" This led to her receiving what is often called the baptism of the Holy Spirit with the evidence of speaking in tongues. She points out that our part as believers is to allow Jesus to reveal Himself to men. She teaches how we must expect and pray that the Spirit of God will meet the spirit of man. God wants us to share spiritual truth with spiritual words (communicating spirit-to-spirit), instead of reasoning with people (communicating mind-to-mind). A final note: The first five minutes of the recording contain a word in tongues with interpretation as well as a prophecy in Chinese that is being translated into English. This may seem unusual if one is not accustomed to the exercise of the gifts of the Spirit. Please let this not keep you from listening on. What follows is a wonderful message on the working of the Holy Spirit that shows that \"evangelism\" really is not our job but God's.",

Jackie Pullinger speaks about the spiritual realities she has experienced in her ministry in Hong Kong among drug addicts, prostitutes & criminals and backs those up by Scripture. She makes clear that the Holy Spirit lives in every true Christian from his or her new birth on. This inner work of the Holy Spirit grows character and fruit in the believer. Jackie goes on to describe an additional and complementary gift. It is often called the outpouring of the Holy Spirit or the baptism of the Holy Spirit. This experience is accompanied by the evidence of a personal prayer language (speaking in tongues). The outpouring of the Holy Spirit equips the believer with power to share Jesus with the lost. Jackie emphasizes again that we must share spiritual truth with spiritual words (1 Corinthians 2:13). The message starts with several wonderful testimonies of how God revealed Himself to the lost in the Wall City and how drug addicts came off drugs with no medication and no withdrawal symptoms.",

Jackie lovingly deals with blocks to receiving and describes how we cooperate with God to speak in tongues. She encourages those who have desired to receive the baptism of the Holy Spirit before and have not spoken in tongues yet. She distinguishes between the nine gifts of the Holy Spirit (1 Corinthians 12:1-11) and the personal prayer language. While any believer can be used by God anytime to operate in any of the nine spiritual gifts, he or she does not \"own\" any of them. The personal prayer language, however, is a gift of God that the believer can \"take home\" and use anytime.",

            "description": "Throughout this beautiful and anointed message, Jackie shares many wonderful testimonies of the work of the Holy Spirit saving, healing and delivering drug addicts, prostitutes and criminals in the Wall City in Hong Kong. She speaks about the revival in China, and how teenage girls leave their homes and walk from village to village sharing Jesus. They come back two years later and multitudes have accepted Christ. These girls have never been to a seminar or a worship service. They simply give everything they have away. Jackie also witnesses about brothers and sisters coming out of decades in prison with broken bodies many times, but rejoicing and shining in their Saviour. She emphasizes that the revival in China is not facilitated by visual aids, life changing tapes, videos of the month or Christian magazines. It comes through the Holy Spirit using \"just a few people who aren't very educated, without microphones, who loved their lives not unto death - that's it.\" In this way, God has chosen the foolish things of the world to shame the wise (1 Corinthians 1:26-27). Jesus came to preach the good news to the poor (Luke 4:18). Jackie explains how the poor are often able to hear the gospel much quicker than an educated person, because they can hear spiritually. This is why the poor in spirit are blessed (Matthew 5:3). Jackie Pullinger emphasizes that men and women are saved through the Spirit of God, not through man's reasoning. She concludes with a call to die and a profound challenge: \"His glory will fall if you go out with nothing except a broken heart and some precious seed, and I suppose we have all got that.\"",
