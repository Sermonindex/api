This qoute \"I will wait for the gracious assistance of God\" is attributed to Whitefield by an eyewitness to his last public sermon, reportedly having said this after he arose from his seat and was not able to speak for several minutes. He goes on to say \"For He will, I am certain, assist me once more to speak in His name.\" The narration goes on to say that \" by 6:30 the next morning, the great preacher was dead. If ever man was ready for this change, Whitefield was that man. When his time came, he had nothing to do, but to die.\"",
