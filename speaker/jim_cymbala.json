In a day when more people are turning to crack than to Christ, he warns that real revival must have a praying people.  When the church today is being inundated with technicians, specialists and methodologies, the answer is not in these but in the power of the Holy Spirit through believing petition.  Cymbala closes by testifying to the God who answers prayer, sharing a very personal account of his wayward daughter brought back to the Lord in a glorious way.",

But the danger of causing another to fall in his right to excercise his liberty, he would rather not, if it would make one fall. Even though he had a right to expect to be supported financially by the church as a minister, he chose to work to support himself, by working with his own hands, driven to preach the gospel, but did not expect reward from anyone other than God. Paul said he was compelled to preach the Gospel. Something is wrong with believers by the multitudes who feel compelled to do nothing for Christ. We as believers need to know what the Lord placed us in the Body of Christ to do. A gripping message!",
