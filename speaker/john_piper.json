And he who believes in me and lives shall never die.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d You believe that? You will never die! Never! You won't die! Jesus said so. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153He who lives and believes in me will never die.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d That was John 11:25. Now John 6:35, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I am the bread of life. Whoever comes to me will not hunger. And whoever believes in me will never thirst. This is the true bread that comes down from heaven. Which if one eats, he will never die.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d Have you eaten?",
