Ridley - a prayer warrior and soldier of the faith, who at one time nearly lost his own life in battle, undertook faithfully to herald and understood first hand how important and imperative it is, to prepare for ETERNITY. The helpless sound, the hopeless sight and the horrible smell of the sting of death surrounded him like a constant companion, in the war as a soldier of WWI and in the work as a chaplain of WWII.\r\nJohn G. Ridley - a veteran evangelist was not one to shy away from confronting his hearers with the truth of their eternal life & challenging their hearts to trust his everlasting Lord.",
