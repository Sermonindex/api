            "description": "Romans says that men are without excuse because God's invisible attributes are seen through his creation.  Ken Ham establishes the necessity for Christians to stand for a six day creation account, and not to succumb to the ways of the world and adopt the \"millions of years\" thesis.  When one does that, he shows that God is no longer a God of love, but rather a cruel, heartless and capricious God.  If one interprets anything in Genesis 1-11 to be allegory, then the very underpinnings of the gospel narrative are also fractured.  One cannot believe that the fall of Adam was allegorical and also believe that the Last Adam took all of an \"allegorical Adam's\" sin upon himself.  This is a very well presented, well thought out, and reasonable argument to establish the importance of a literal creation account.",

            "description": "Brother Ken Ham explains to his audience how Answers In Genesis is on a mission to establish the authority of the Word of God more than they are out to debate evolution vs. creationism.  He shows how important it is to filter all of history through what the scriptures say happened than to reverse that and make the bible accountable to humanistic thought.  He shows how if you cannot believe what the Bible says about Biology, Geology, and Astronomy, what are you going to do when it talks about morality?  He also points out how the Holy Spirit predicted the scoffing view of evolution through 2Peter 3:3-7. Ham also explains how so many things we believe moralistically come from Genesis 1-11.",

            "description": "As an international Speaker, Ken Ham points out how in America, unlike any other nation on the planet, there is a unique problem with racism.  Specifically he objects to the prejudice and racism of \u2018Christians,\u2019 and Americans in general who have adopted petty ideas about it from evolutionary history and cults. He shows through the Bible, and genetics, how we are all in fact just one race, and that is the \u2018race,\u2019 of Adam.  He says that people who preach that it is wrong to marry inter-racially are simply not preaching a biblical ideal and need to repent.  He shows how a belief in Evolution promotes racism and prejudice, and how the only form of inter-racial marriage to be concerned about is when a child born of the \u2018Last Adam,\u2019 marries a child only born of the \u2018First Adam.\u2019",

He quotes numerous Christian sources from mainstream Christianity to show how they have kowtowed to the world by shoving \u201cmillions of years\u201d into the scriptures through eisogesis.   He points out how no Christian ever believed the world was created in more than six days until the seventeen to eighteen hundreds, when the world told Christianity what they were allowed to believe about the word.  However...God gave man dominion over the world\u2026not the word.",
