Under the Old Covenant, the Pharisees were told that if you do \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcthis\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, God will bless you. If you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t, you will be punished. But the New Covenant is different; it is an invitation for us to partake of the very nature of Christ. It is not \u00e2\u20ac\u0153do\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s\u00e2\u20ac\u009d and \u00e2\u20ac\u0153don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ts,\u00e2\u20ac\u009d rather, it is looking at Christ and following Him. Everything we do, think and dream about, it all has to do with following Him. It is not me trying to figure out what I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m going to do with my life, rather, it is asking the Lord, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153What is it You are wanting me to do?
