            "description": "Brother Maxwell speaks on the main hindrance to revival in the Scripture, and the main hindrance today: our own sin. The reason we don't see God move is that we think that someone else besides us is blocking the moving of the Spirit. Included is a very interesting narrative about Dr. Ernest M. Wadsworth that documents his efforts for ministers to look inward to unblock the hindrance to revival, as well as many angry church members that called him during the week after being told to 'make your crooked places straight.' \"I went to the office of the mayor and was ushered into a private room. After I was seated, he said, 'I heard your sermon yesterday morning, now; man to man, I want to know who's been telling you about me?'\"",

            "description": "This passage in Romans is often misinterpretted by many in the church today, to mean that to recieved the gift of the Spirit is the same as being filled with the Spirit, which it is not.  Pastor Maxwell shows how in many cases in the scriptures the filling of the Holy Spirit was subsequent to the recieving of the Spirit.  He shows that the prescence of the Spirit is not the smae as the presiding of the Spirit, this is how the Holy Spirit can be present in us but we are not allowing Him to rule over over us.",

            "description": "Why do we want to be filled with Holy Spirit?  To be filled with Spirit will not bring us fame, prosperity, the love and admiration of our fellow man.  It will most likely bring division, reproach and persecution.  So is the example shown in the scriptures both old and new testaments, in the cases of Elijah in the cave, Jonah under the gourd, Paul in prison, John the Baptists beheading, Steven's stoning and of course the Lord Jesus' crucifxion. We are filled with the Holy Spirit for God's purposes and His alone.",
