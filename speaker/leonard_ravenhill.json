Our obedience, like everything else in the Christian life, is by the faith of the Son of God. By faith Moses' parents sent him down the Nile in a basket, because without God's intervention the child would certainly have died. By faith Moses chose the affliction of the people of God, forsaking the pleasures of sin and the riches of Egypt, because he trusted the Lord to make him a partaker of the riches of Christ. Faith \"reckons, risks and rests\" - and secures God's promises, sometimes by doing what is foolish in the eyes of the world. Such obedience can only arise from confidence in God to keep his promises, regardless of appearances.",

The majority of the sermon discusses the first half of 1 Cor 13; specifically verses 1 through 8. There are many old hymns and writings quoted by Brother Len that focus on the person and love of God and His Christ intertwined in the message, quite a few from Wesley. There is also some time spent on some of the past saints that exemplified this love.",

            "description": "The Scripture focus of this message is Luke 17:32, with references to Genesis 6:5, and others referring to Abraham and Lot (Gen: 13:12, 18:17 and multiple references out of chapter 19). There is a warning in this message related to the modern church, in that we have access to all that we need today to live in God's will, just as did Lot, his wife, and daughters, who willfully turned away, though they were closely related to Abraham. Brother Len quotes Romans 1 from Phillip's translation. Classic Ravenhill: \"I'm angry with Lot. Wait 'til I see him. I'll tell him off, I'll tell you that.\"",

He takes the life of moses and shows how he choosed rather to suffer for the sake of Christ then enjoy the pleasures of sin for a short time. The same thing can be asked of the church today? There are many different tangents and convicting statements brought up as the spirit of God lead brother ravenhill to speak. This is a must listen.",

Prayer is preoccupation with our needs. Praise is preoccupation with our blessings. Worship is preoccupation with God Himself.  Many Christians substitute service for worship, remembering the first commandment is to worship the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your mine and all your strength, and to worship Him in spirit and truth and the beauty of holiness; for the Father seeks those who will truly worship Him.",

I thought it appropriate to post this sermon on Timothy Ministry.com and am certain that if you take the time to listen you will be challenged, impacted and blessed. Brother Ravenhill speaks from years of Christian service and experience, and in many ways is like Paul exhorting the younger generations",

            "description": "A deeply moving wake-up call to the church, instructing her to live in the light of eternity, \"for we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ\" (2 Corinthians 5:10). Leonard Ravenhill describes the judgment day from Scripture as a court day  where the verdict is final. He first points to the judgment of the unjust and then focusses on the judgment of the righteous. He emphasizes that we will all stand before Jesus alone and will not only be judged for what we have done, but also for what we have not done that we should have done. He denounces the worldliness of the people of God who invest their time and money as the world does - thus building on wood, hay and stubble as opposed to silver, gold and precious stones. Leonard Ravenhill strongly opposes today's \"sloppy gospel\" and \"sloppy evangelism\"  of a love with no judgment. He warns that we are passing from the mercy of the lamb to the wrath of the lamb when Jesus judges the earth and mercy will be gone forever. As the work of every human being shall be tried in the fire, many public ministries will go down in ashes. Leonard describes 95 % of believers as bound by superstition and theology. He criticizes the unjust money-making of public ministries that leads to false investments of large amounts of money. He states that we must have Jesus take the government over our lives in reality and be lost and consumed in Him. Ravenhill closes his sermon with a strong call to repentance: \"If we cannot live as a different breed of people on this earth we have no right to live here. God stamp eternity on my eyeballs.\"",

Secondly, he discusses man's dealing with holy things of God, namely the ark of God. The application he preaches on is how we try to dress the gospel up to modernize it. He points out that the man who tried to steady the ark was not blaspheming God, he was not smashing it, or in any way intentionally rebelling against the Lord; but for all this, he was still disobediant and killed on the spot. \"A lady called me from the border of Mexico today...she was weeping, she said, '...oh, we do want to be such great soulwinners'...I said to her, my dear look, the first commandment is not, \"thou shalt be a soulwinner,\" the first commandment is, \"thou shalt love the Lord thy God...\"",
