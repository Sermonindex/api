            "description": "This message was delivered at Bob Jones Univeristy and begins with Bible recitals and hymns sung by some of the girls who were saved while in Lester Rolofs homes for young people. The sin of Idolatory almost always leads into bondage, and this is where we find the children of Isreal at the start of Exodus.  Dr Rolof reveals a great turth in this story of the exodus, that it wasn't the plagues that freed the people God had chosen from bondage but the Blood. How it was only possible, and still is, only possible to be truelly free bondage by no other way than by the blood of the Lord Jesus Christ.",

            "description": "Here is a call for a return to holiness, that begins simply by observing the 5th commandment 'Remember the sabbath day, to keep it holy.'  The Lords day was instituted for us to rest on and refresh ourselves both spiritually and physically. And yet on this day so many people in the church are not resting in the Lord but using their day of rest to entertain the flesh, Dr Rolof shows that we cannot absorb the corruptions that are in the world and yet remain holy before the Lord God.",

Here in 2 Kings 6 we find the people of God busy working. Suddenly an important part of the work, the axehead, is lost, and trees cannot be cut down without an axehead, the work grinds to a halt.  This is a figure of how the work of God cannot go on without all the parts being in place, and how to recover when sopmething is lost.  The young man cries to his master and so should we in time of struggle when we have lost something that hinders the work of the Lord only the Lord can replace it.",
