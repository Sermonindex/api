Cahill gives numerous practical helps for those who desire to share their faith with others.  \"Every time you share your faith is a winning situation.\"  The question is not, \"Do you care?\" but, \"Do you care enough to do something about it?\"",

            "description": "\"What's it going to take to get out of your comfort zone?\" asks Mark Cahill about how much we truly care for souls in light of 600,000 people entering eternity each time we put our head on our pillow.  Mark is very serious, very convicting, as well as very humble and compassionate.  This is a much-needed message in our day of awakening us to our opportunity and responsibility to honor and glorify God in our one earthly life.  (Preached on Nov. 5, 2003 at Cedarville University; 30 minutes)",
