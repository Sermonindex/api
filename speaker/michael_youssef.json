The Youssef's came to America in 1977, and in 1978 Michael received a master's degree in theology at Fuller Theological Seminary in California and a Ph.D. from Emory University in social anthropology. Michael served for nearly ten years with the Haggai Institute, traveling around the world more than 32 times, teaching courses in evangelism and church leadership to church leaders. He rose to the position of Managing Director at the age of 31. The family settled in Atlanta, and in 1984, Michael became a United States citizen, fulfilling a dream he had held for many years.\r\nHe founded The Church of The Apostles in 1987 with fewer than 40 adults with the mission to \"Equip the Saints and Seek the Lost.\" The church has since grown to a congregation of over 3000. This church on a hill was the launching pad for Leading the Way's international ministry. While heard by millions at home and abroad, behind every message preached over the airwaves is a pastor's heart, longing to feed and care for people. Clearly God has uniquely equipped Dr. Youssef to speak to a worldwide audience. The path he has walked has given him a thorough cross-cultural understanding and a firm grasp of Scripture. He preaches, teaches and exhorts with a straightforward and uncompromising delivery, based on the authority of the inspired, infallible Word of God. His unique, firsthand understanding of the Holy Land, its history and culture, brings the Bible to life for listeners.",

            "description": "Michael Youssef shares this powerful sermon at the 2007 National Broadcasters Association. There is a deep burden and weeping over the state of America and Evangelism in this message. Oh that we would hear it all with \"ears that can hear\" what the Spirit is saying to the Churches. This is a urgent appeal from the heart of God over the declension and need of a genuine biblical revival in our generation.",
