God wants to enrich our faith by showing us the glory of Christ\u2019s kingdom, compared to the impotence of three competing kingdoms, and thus save you from an inferior foundation for your life. 1. The pride of self-righteous religion (the high priest). 2. The fear of the individualist (Peter). 3. The power of the cynical, unbelieving world. (Pilate)",
