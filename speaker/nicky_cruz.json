            "description": "This is one of the most powerful testimonies of our modern age. Nicky Cruz, a hardened violent street kid in New York City and leader of the dreaded Mau Mau gang, encounters Jesus Christ and experiences a radical change in his once dark and hopeless life. This is his story, his progression from unloved child to being alone on the streets of NY, to gang leader and then meeting David Wilkerson, and finally, being apprehended by the Lord Jesus Christ who wrought a powerful and amazing conversion in his heart. A must hear!",
