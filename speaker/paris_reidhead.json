You will never hear this text again without remembering this powerful exposition of God's Word. From Matthew 18:19-20. What does it mean to pray\/live\/gather \"in Jesus' name\"? In this sermon, we look at what it truly means to be in unity with Christ and his Body. We find that there are five different groups in the organized church:\r\n\r\n1) Those who have met the \"forgiving Christ.\" That is, they have \"accepted Jesus\" primarily to escape hell, suffering, and punishment. \r\n2) Those who have met the \"utilitarian Christ.\" That is, they have found that God can help them get what they need -- their whole interest in Christianity is that they should be taken care of by faith. \r\n3) Those who have met the \"status-giving Christ.\" These have joined the Church because they wanted fellowship and to be around the people. Position within the group is also typically very important within this group, and any achievement is hailed as part of the \"glory of God.\"\r\n4) Those who have met the \"emotion-satisfying Christ.\" Their whole purpose in Christianity and religion is to satisfy their emotional needs. They look for everything that will make them laugh, cry, or both.\r\n5) Those \"who have met the Holy God and the Sovereign Christ.\" They have seen their terrible sinfulness and have known forgiveness, their prayers have been answered, they have found status as God's Children, and they have been filled with the Joy of God. But in addition to all this, this group is living only for God's glory and to walk according to the Cross. Only this fifth group is the true Church of God. \r\n\r\nAny attempt to revive or unite all five groups will fail, but the fifth group can truly be one and bring glory to God.",

God continually reveals His hidden wisdom for our spiritual blessings by His Holy Spirit. This message shows that God often needs to get the structure of the Church out of the way in order to get his work accomplished. Reidhead discusses the Chinese Church (the \"house church movement\") and its success compared to Western Christianity. He also talks about the judgment hanging over the United States and of the terrible persecution that is coming (as Reidhead says \"every prophet\" in China or Russia has been prophesying). \"If God doesn't judge America, he'll have to apologize to Sodom and Gomorrah for what he did to them.\" He then discusses the \"manchild\" from Revelation 12, saying that it is now within the Church (the woman) but will soon be cast out of the woman. The lukewarm Church simply wants to get those who are wholeheartedly serving God out of its midst. A must-listen, especially for those who are aware of the destruction hanging over America.",

            "description": "The history of the church from hillside to magnificent cathedral. Is it God's way, or our way? God continually reveals His hidden wisdom for our spiritual blessings by His Holy Spirit. This message shows that God often needs to get the structure of the Church out of the way in order to get his work accomplished. Reidhead discusses the Chinese Church (the \"house church movement\") and its success compared to Western Christianity. He also talks about the judgment hanging over the United States and of the terrible persecution that is coming (as Reidhead says \"every prophet\" in China or Russia has been prophesying). \"If God doesn't judge America, he'll have to apologize to Sodom and Gomorrah for what he did to them.\" He then discusses the \"manchild\" from Revelation 12, saying that it is now within the Church (the woman) but will soon be cast out of the woman. The lukewarm Church simply wants to get those who are wholeheartedly serving God out of its midst. A must-listen, especially for those who are aware of the destruction hanging over America.",

            "description": "Starting in Romans 3:19-31, this sermon shows the purpose and necessity of the Law in producing genuine conversion. Although all can recall wrongdoing, the Law has been given to convict us of sin -- to show the enormity of our crime against a holy, just, and righteous God. Until we are convicted of our crime and cry out to be free, the Gospel of salvation holds no real meaning. Unfortunately, most preaching over the last 100 years has not started with the Law but has instead been offering a Gospel to people who are really unaware from what they must be saved. The Holy Spirit has thus been stripped of \"the only tool He has ever used to prepare men for Grace.\" The Law was never intended for Salvation, but to reveal the character of both God and man and to point to man's need of Christ. A must-listen.",
