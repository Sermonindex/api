            "description": "When most of us think of kingdom Christians, we think of groups like the Waldensians and Anabaptists\u00e2\u20ac\u201dmovements that sprang up in western Europe. But the work of the Holy Spirit has never been limited to western Europe and the Americas. No, the Spirit has raised up kingdom Christians at various times and in various places all over the world, including Russia and the East.  The story of the various Spirit-led groups of Christians in Old Russia is quite fascinating. Peter Hoover, author of the popular Secret of the Strength, brings their story to life in his book, The Russian Secret.",
