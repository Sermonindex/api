That vision has remained in the heart of the Chinese church for 80 years and is still alive today. One small group of missionaries made it all the way to Xinjiang in the 1940\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s, but were stopped and imprisoned there by the government. The Back to Jerusalem Gospel Mission was founded by Brother Peter Xu in 2003 to raise awareness of the vision and train missionaries to fulfill the mission.",
