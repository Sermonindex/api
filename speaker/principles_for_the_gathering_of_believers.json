The names of those who have had a part in this volume are too numerous to mention. To all those who labored in editing, revising, suggesting and offering your counsel we are indebted. Above every human help we recognize the Lord\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hand in this volume from the start to finish. The messages in this book were birthed out of a genuine burden2 of the Lord and we pray this burden has been conveyed with as little interference from the human vessels3 as possible.",

This kind of humility is today manifested in many underground and persecuted Churches across the world because they have dealt the death blow to pride and independence.39 These persecuted believers have become solely dependent on Jesus Christ as the Head to lead them and guide their meeting as Churches.40 A brother stated this truth, in another way: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Christ should be the gathering center of His people. We should be drawn by His presence, not by a man. When believers see this and act upon it, the local Assembly need not be shaken by the departure of any man. An Assembly where Christians gather to Christ has strength, stability and solidarity.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d",

When believers gather in smaller groups it allows the Lord\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s people to meet more frequently during the week, even daily, as the early Church did.57 This provides the confidence and expectation to meet with other wholehearted disciples of Jesus Christ, to meet with the Lord Jesus who is in the midst, to receive direction from the Lord and to benefit from mutual encouragement58 and prayers.",

There is a great benefit at times in having a building where the Lord\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s people can meet in and use for the ministry of the Gospel. Yet, when we look at the Book of Acts, we find no visible record that the Church built buildings. Though they met in some physical locations such as Solomon\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Colonnade113 and the hall of Tyrannus for even two years!114 Yet, this was not the common practice of how saints met across the rest of God\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Churches. Even when looking carefully in Church history it is hard to find evidence of a building being used until 300 AD when pagan temples were being converted into churches under the reign of Constantine.",

Rather, gathering in this way is a preferred Biblical approach, especially when the Church is under persecution. If it was important to have specific church buildings to represent God and spread the Gospel, would God not have commanded them in Scripture? Although we find detailed instructions for the tabernacle in the Old Testament122 we find quite a different emphasis in the New Testament.123 We see this truth prophetically spoken by Stephen just before he was martyred: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153However, the Most High does not live in houses made by human hands. As the prophet says: \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcHeaven is My throne, and the earth is My footstool. What kind of house will you build for Me? Says the Lord. Or where will My resting place be? Has not My hand made all these things?\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 You stiff-necked people! Your hearts and ears are still uncircumcised.

When Luther nailed his theses to the door of the cathedral at Wittenburg,135 cautious men were astonished at his audacity. When John Wesley ignored all church restrictions136 and religious propriety and preached in the fields and byways, men declared his reputation was ruined. So it has been in all ages. When the religious condition of the times called for men who were willing to sacrifice all for Christ, the demand created the supply, and there have always been found a few who have been willing to be regarded reckless for the Lord. An utter recklessness concerning men\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s opinions and other consequences is the only attitude137 that can meet the exigencies of the present times.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d",

Over the past 50 years particularly originating in Western countries there have been such excesses and abuses of what is considered Spirit-filled Christianity that many true believers have been repulsed completely from even seeking the Lord for the true filling of the Spirit. This is not only a tragedy but one of Satan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tactics323 to hinder the growth of the true Church of Jesus Christ. The genuine believer should never feel scared to call out to God for fresh infusions of the Spirit of God for service324 and to foster a dependence on the Holy Spirit of God daily in his life.",

The task of sharing the Gospel is for every Christian, even if they give their life as a martyr. Chinese Christians teach us that when their seed (their life) has gone into the ground and died it will multiply and produce much more fruit.544 With their blood new growth is coming.

Yet in the early Church and Biblical record, God calls the people themselves the Church.629\r\nOne of the main desires in church planting in North America is the constructing of a church building after a group of believers is established. This is not always helpful. The true work of God is not dependent on money and resources to grow but rather on hearts that have been affected by the Gospel of our Lord. If we focus on building structures and churches, we can subtly deceive the people to depend on such structures630 and not the living Lord.",

It is told to us by the Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of God, Himself.

He has been building a pure pristine Book of Acts fellowship in House Church networks all over rural China. There is a simplicity to the move of God yet such fervency, love, and desire born in the hearts of these believers. We need to break out of the simple 1 hour church meeting patterns, and start to serve the Lord with full commitment like many of these precious brothers and sisters in the Lord. For many of us the questions and truths that are revealed are very important for us to hear as we gather under the Headship of Jesus Christ in local areas.",

            "description": "There is a great need in the body of Christ for consistent reading of the Holy Scriptures in their entirety, book by book, chapter by chapter, verse by verse. In this case we are encouraging a chronological reading of the Scriptures. Most of the confusion is created when certain teachers, groups, or denominations take singular verses out of context and compare them with others. Though it is a good spiritual principle to compare spiritual truths with spiritual truths,1139 yet this must all be done in the larger context of God\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Word. Therefore we are encouraging all of God\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s saints to have a consistent discipline of reading through the whole Scriptures once a year as a supplemental reading plan.",

            "description": "Dear brothers and sisters we are writing these practical guidelines on how to gather as a fellowship under the Headship of Jesus Christ not as rules but rather helpful ways forward for some. Any 2-3 brothers or sisters can meet in this way and start to allow the Lord to mature their gathering. We must have the simplicity of faith that our Gathering is unto Him and not for ourselves. Early Christians met together with a great joy at times because they were gathering with others who have been redeemed by the precious blood of Jesus Christ. So Jesus Christ Himself was the center of their unity. These simple guidelines combine many of the Principles found in the Principles for the Gathering of Believers volume.",

            "description": "For many believers there has been a lack of good resources to help them worship the Lord in private devotion or in public gatherings of the Lord\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s people. Many hymns and choruses that could be sung by memory and without instruments have been laid aside for more contemporary songs that have much musical accompaniment. The argument is not over styles of music or what is permissible in a worship setting but rather that a very powerful weapon of the Church has been lost. This occurs when we do not have many hymns and choruses that we can sing without instruments with a whole heart towards the Lord. Thus the burden here is to simply supply a resource of many old hymns, choruses and spiritual songs for reading, meditation and singing privately and corporately.",

            "description": "The importance of liturgy in the history of the Christian Church over the 2000 years cannot be underestimated. Some of the earliest hymns in the Church were chants or Scriptural truths read aloud in unison. To verbally proclaim in unison holy truths of God will have a great affect spiritually on the Assembly of believers to strengthen and unify them in the faith once delivered to the saints.1148\r\nWe are commended in the Scriptures to verbally proclaim our allegiance to the Son of God, confessing truths that we believe in our heart.1149 Though modern day evangelicalism is mostly non-liturgical this was not so in the early days of Christianity.",
