The Bible statement of the way is not mystical nor mysterious, it is very plain and straightforward. If we will only make personal trial of \"The Power of the Word of God,\" \"The Power of the Blood of Christ,\" \"The Power of the Holy Spirit,\" \"The Power of Prayer,\" \"The Power of a Surrendered Life,\" we will then know \" The Fulness of Power in Christian Life and Service.\" We will try to make this plain in the following chapters.",
