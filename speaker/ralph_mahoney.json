In this solid two-part exhortation, unrecognized forerunning prophet Ralph Mahoney, founder of World Missionary Assistance Planning (World MAP) gets us to rethink the relationship between ministry and intimacy in our knowing of the Lord. In Part 1, Ralph draws on extensive missions experience to challenge the harried and materialistic \"enterprise-centered\" ministry that has engulfed the western church. Part 2 leads us through the process of the \"furnace of affliction\" that must characterize all true prophetic \"knowers\" of the Lord.",
