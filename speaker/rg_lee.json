            "description": "Arguably the most preached, most famous sermon of the 20th century, Payday Someday conclusively proves that God's judgment on sin is final and sure. Lee preached this sermon over a thousand times, and thousands of folks will be in heaven as a result. Of the many who were saved as a result of Payday Someday, the story is told of one man who was mad and was going to shoot his wife. A friend begged the man to settle down long enough to listen to the sermon. The man reluctantly agreed. After the sermon he got down on his knees and begged his wife to forgive him. Come Sunday morning, the man confessed faith in Jesus and was baptized.",

To those who are far away in the jungles and mountains of sin. To those who are subjected to fearful temptations is invitation. To those who are cursed by burdens is invitation.
