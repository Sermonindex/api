    "description": "Robert Murray M'Cheyne (1813 - 1843)\r\nListen to freely downloadable audio sermons by the speaker Robert Murray M'Cheyne in mp3 format. Scottish divine, youngest son of Adam McCheyne, writer to the signet, was born in Edinburgh, 21 May 1813. At the age of four he knew the characters of the Greek alphabet, and was able to sing and recite fluently. He entered the high school in his eighth year, and matriculated in November 1827 at Edinburgh University, where he showed very versatile powers, and distinguished himself especially in poetical exercises, being awarded a special prize by Professor Wilson for a poem on 'The Covenanters.' In the winter of 1831 he commenced his studies in the Divinity Hall, under Dr. Chalmers and Dr. Welsh; and he was licensed as a preacher by the Annan presbytery on 1 July 1835.\r\n\r\nMcCheyne devoted all his energies to preaching; and although he was an accomplished Hebrew scholar, he left few permanent proofs of his erudition. He had refined musical taste, and was one of the first of the Scottish ministers to take an active part in the improvement of the congregational service of praise. Long after his death he was constantly referred to as 'the saintly McCheyne.'",

At some previous times I have spoken to you on the subject of an eternal hell \u00e2\u20ac\u201d on the worm that never dies, and the fire that is never quenched; but there is one part of the subject I have passed over, namely, the mental agonies of hell, and that is a castaway. The word 'castaway' is supposed to be taken from workers of metals; you know there is a part of the metal which comes out of the furnace which is called dross, which is of no manner of use and is cast away. The same word is sometimes translated 'reprobate'. Those of you in this congregation who will be cast away will be found to be but dross, 'reprobate silver shall men call them' (Jeremiah 6:30).",

The wise and foolish are alike in many things (verses 3,4)\r\n3. There is a difference: The foolish virgins have no oil in their vessels.\r\n4. The tarrying of the bridegroom. (verse 5)\r\n5. The sleep of the virgins: 'They all slumbered and slept.'\r\n6. The coming of the Bridegroom. The time: 'at midnight.'\r\n7. The discovery: 'Our lamps are gone out.' (verse 6-9)\r\n8. The anxious application: 'Give us of your oil.'\r\n9. The disappointment: 'Not so, lest there be not enough for us and you.'\r\n10. Who are ready? (verse 10-13)\r\n11. The reward of those who are ready: 'They went in with him to the marriage.'\r\n12. The fate of hypocrites: 'The door was shut.'",
