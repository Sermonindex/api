Thus our forgiveness came at the greatest cost to Him the death of His Son, the Lord Jesus.  And it is not without a cost that we are to forgive others as we have been forgiven, to forgive means to forgoe our rights and to suffer the cost.  Pastor Hession shows that at the root of unforgiveness is pride saying 'I wont forgive this person, they have violated my rights!' and also that when we are wronged and forgive then when the person comes and ask forgiveness we will be able to say 'There is nothing to forgive' as it is an old account that has been settled, just as ours was on Calvary.",

First the dominion of sin is the guilt of sin which is the same as the power of sin, sin has power over us when we feel the guilt that comes with it, and the passage of time does nothing to releave the power of sin over us to make us feel condemned.  Secondly to be under the Law means that we are trying to please God by trying to keep the moral Law which cannot be done thus the law is the power of sin, as we try and keep the law and fail the guilt , or power, of sin increases on us, we thus end up feeling so condemned that we think that bit of extra sin cannot make a bad situation worse.  Thirdly though despite all this we are under grace, not the dominion of sin, neither the law but grace!  The grace of God is shown in that even though we deserve Hell He gives us love and mercy.  Finally to reckon ourselves dead to sin means to realise sin has no more power to condemn us because of the work of the Lord Jesus on the cross of calvary.",

The power of sin over the christian, or anyone, is it's ability to condemn and maintain our guilt before the law of God, we can go on for years under the power of a sin that we may only have commited once, this is the sanre designed by Satan himself and the more we try and work our way free the tighter it becomes and the more condemned we feel trying to live up to the law in order to please God.  But praise God for the Lord Jesus who took upon Himself the wieght of sin and not only that but became my sin and yours for us, He alone could have exhausted the power of sin and the law over us and so He alone can free us from it's grasp.",

And when God sees the blood He will 'passover' which here in the hebrew conveys a sense of God standing over us in a protective way.
