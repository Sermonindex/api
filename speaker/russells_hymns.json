John 14:16\r\n\r\nOh spread the tidings \u2018round wherever man is found\r\nWherever human hearts and human woes abound\r\nLet every Christian tongue proclaim the joyful sound\r\nThe Comforter has come\r\n\r\nChorus\r\nThe Comforter has come, the Comforter has come\r\nThe Holy Ghost from Heaven, the Father\u2019s promise given\r\nOh spread the tidings \u2018round wherever man is found\r\nThe Comforter has come\r\n\r\nThe long, long night is past, the morning breaks at last\r\nAnd hushed the dreadful sound and fury of the blast\r\nAs over golden hills the day advances fast!\r\nThe Comforter has come\r\n\r\nChorus\r\n\r\nLo, the great King of kings with healing in His wings\r\nTo every captive soul a full deliverance brings\r\nAnd through the vacant cells the song of triumph rings\r\nThe Comforter has come\r\n\r\nChorus\r\n\r\nOh boundless love divine! How shall this tongue of mine\r\nTo wondering mortals tell the matchless grace divine?\r\nThat I, a child of hell, should in His image shine\r\nThe Comforter has come\r\n\r\nChorus",
