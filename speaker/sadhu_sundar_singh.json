    "description": "Sadhu Sundar Singh (1889 - 1929)\r\nListen to freely downloadable audio sermons by the speaker Sadhu Sundar Singh in mp3 format. Was an Indian Christian missionary. He is believed to have died in the foothills of the Himalayas in 1929.  Sundar felt that his religious pursuits in Sikhism and the questioning of Christian and Hindu priests left him without ultimate meaning. Sundar resolved to kill himself by throwing himself upon a railroad track. He asked that whosoever is the 'True God' would appear before him, or else he would kill himself; that very night he had a vision of Jesus who opened Sundar's soul to the truth.\r\n\r\nIn October 1906, he set out on his journey as a new Christian, wearing a turban and the yellow robe of a Hindu sadhu, an ascetic devoted to spiritual practice. Singh viewed himself as a sadhu, albeit one within Christianity rather than Hinduism, because he realised Christianity could not penetrate India unless it was in an Indian way. \"I am not worthy to follow in the steps of my Lord,\" he said, \"but, like Him, I want no home, no possessions. Like Him I will belong to the road, sharing the suffering of my people, eating with those who will give me shelter, and telling all men of the love of God.\"",
