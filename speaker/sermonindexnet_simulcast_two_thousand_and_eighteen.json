It is without exaggeration that we are living in times unparalleled in history. As a nation, America is in a cross-roads and the world is reeling to and fro without any moral bearing. Amidst this great crisis, the Church seems to be sleeping. We desperately need true revival from heaven. After five years of not hosting any large events, the Lord has placed on our hearts to host again a large SermonIndex Simulcast meeting. We pray that this is just not another conference or meeting, but a crisis point that we can hear clearly God\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s heart and respond with repentance and prayer. It is not too late for God to send revival, revive His Church, and win the lost world to Himself.\r\n\r\nAll speakers have come freely on their own accord not recieving any honorium. The event is 100% free. SermonIndex does not recieve any money from the event. We have prayerfully selected 12 speakers to seek the face of God and give us God\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s heart for the current hour. Would you consider being a part of this event in 2018 and being part of the solution of praying for revival? Our focus is on Jesus Christ and not on men, but we do believe God will speak through these men as vessels to help us in our response to God.",

It is without exaggeration that we are living in times unparalleled in history. As a nation, America is in a cross-roads and the world is reeling to and fro without any moral bearing. Amidst this great crisis, the Church seems to be sleeping. We desperately need true revival from heaven. After five years of not hosting any large events, the Lord has placed on our hearts to host again a large SermonIndex Simulcast meeting. We pray that this is just not another conference or meeting, but a crisis point that we can hear clearly God\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s heart and respond with repentance and prayer. It is not too late for God to send revival, revive His Church, and win the lost world to Himself.\r\n\r\nAll speakers have come freely on their own accord not recieving any honorium. The event is 100% free. SermonIndex does not recieve any money from the event. We have prayerfully selected 12 speakers to seek the face of God and give us God\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s heart for the current hour. Would you consider being a part of this event in 2018 and being part of the solution of praying for revival? Our focus is on Jesus Christ and not on men, but we do believe God will speak through these men as vessels to help us in our response to God.",
