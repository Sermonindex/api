There has been much prayer and support in the west for those precious saints who suffer for Jesus in restricted and closed nations. Now some choice servants are saying persecution will be coming upon the Church in North America. We are anything but prepared. This simulcast event is geared to warn and help the Church in North America start the process of being ready for persecution.\r\n\r\nAll speakers have come freely on their own accord not recieving any honorium. The event is 100% free. SermonIndex does not recieve any money from the event. The First Baptist Church is hosting us freely. We believe that this event is an expression of the body of Christ coming together in this critical time. Our desire is simply to see the body of Christ strengthened through this event.",

From the book of Habbukuk he shares how the prophet struggled with coming judgment in his day and we must accept the same in our day. He also gives the solution of the great truth of the true baptism of the Holy Spirit for to reach the lost world and make disciples.  This message is needful to be heard by the whole Church in this hour.",
