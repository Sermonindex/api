Trevor has done well over 1,700 concerts in his 15 years of full time ministry. Previously to that there were several years of part time ministry; which included singing on street corners. God; in His own unique way, has placed Trevor on many stages. \u00e2\u20ac\u00a8Feeling undeserving of such opportunities he has shared his message with many people of influence; including the Prime Minister of Canada.\u00e2\u20ac\u00a8 Trevor Baker has also sang in the United States at David Wilkerson's Times Square Church in New York City twice.\r\nWith much of the present Church age running after every wind and wave of doctrine, most of the songs that God has given him are calling the Church back to repentance. Although he has won awards he finds that many times they only get in the way of the message \u00e2\u20ac\u0153There are many things in life that are uncertain\u00e2\u20ac\u009d, he states. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I grew up thinking that God was one of them.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d Trevor admits openly that he was searching for some meaning in life. He didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t like the angry young man that he was and felt that his life had no direction. During this time of crisis, Trevor says that he met a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcgenuine, simple kinda\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 preacher\u00e2\u20ac\u009d in a little church who introduced him to Jesus Christ; the only One that could give him peace and direction.",
