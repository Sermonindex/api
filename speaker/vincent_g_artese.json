All the faithful are crucified with Christ through all of the ages. Once a believer is regenerated the old man should be hardly recognized, and must not reign! Those crucified with Christ have been united in the likeness of His death. Only then will one be united in the likeness of His death and the likeness of His resurrection. He who has died has been freed from sin and the old life is dead. To be crucified with Christ means to be changed.",

Circumcise yourselves to the LORD, and take away the foreskins of your hearts because your doings are evil. The Church is heading in the wrong direction. The wills of those within it are revolting against God. Do not be deceived by outward professions! Those who bear the good fruit of holy living are the true Church of Jesus Christ. Many religious leaders have risen up and prophesied falsely, but the people love to have it so. These false shepherds cannot be trusted. Repent! Be deceived no longer! What will you do in the end?",
