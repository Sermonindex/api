We may hold on to relationships, plans, dreams and\/or a set of goals. Many times these are the very things that are hindering us from the supernatural plan that God has for our lives. This message provokes us to have a direct confrontation with these things and a mindset that says this thing needs to go! As we begin to let go God will begin to take us into the blessings that were already promised to us. The rest comes when we simply agree with God in every area of our life.",

God will allow these trials to show us that even in the mundane we don't have the strength or the resources to do anything on our own. Sometimes faith is a gut cry out of the depths of our soul that simply says \"JESUS HELP ME!\" These storms are opportunities to remember God's faithfulness in our past and to absolutely trust Him with our future. God will take us from faith to faith when He finds a heart that simply chooses to trust Him!",

All that is in us must bow to the Truth of God's Word. When we open the Bible it takes us into the atmosphere of heaven and we experience the presence of God. This book reveals the mind, heart and plan of God. It tells us who we are, what God has called us to do and what God has called us to be. There is an enemy that will stop at nothing to keep us from the promises of God, but if we set our heart to seek Him we will be drawn by the Holy Spirit and the Word of God will be revealed to us.

The Cross doesn\u2019t promise that when we agree to walk with God that the storms in our lives will cease. The Cross doesn\u2019t offer a \u201cmountain top\u201d religion with all glory and no pain. There is nothing pretty or desirable about the Cross. Nobody wants to suffer or have the deepest issues of their heart uprooted. Nevertheless the Cross must become central to a Christian's life. When we choose to identify with the Cross we are choosing to die to a self-centered life and to live a life that is others-centered. Sometimes the biggest Cross we have to bear is coming to terms with the fact that we cannot bear our cross in our own strength. Give up your \u201cpower\u201d to help yourself and let God's power lift you up and take you where you cannot go in your own strength.",

This message suggests that God ALWAYS asks too much and it is never God's design or desire that we should ever be in a place where we think that what God is requiring is something that we can bring about in our own strength or by our own power. When God first speaks His promises to us there is strong expectancy for the fulfillment of that promise. But as time passes on and we are still waiting the possible begins to seem impossible. It is in these times of delay that our flesh will begin to think that we can make things happen in our own time and our own way. God in His mercy will bring us through the refiner's fire so we can let go of all that we think we are and what we think we are supposed to do. He will refine our gifts and our calling until He has complete ownership and lordship over them.",
