Brother Zac shows the safety of pressures and persecutions such as Noah faced for 120 years; his fall came in the time of ease.  We can learn from the curse of Ham to put to death this evil curiosity to see the nakedness of others, which manifests itself in many ways.",

Have you allowed Him to transform and change your life? This is going to be the Real Jesus and it is unfortunate that we have to speak about that because God never intended that there should ever be any other Jesus presented to this world than the real one. Everything valuable has been counterfeited, people don't counterfeit things that are not valuable. Even in the times of the apostles we read of Jesus being counterfeited. So I want to turn first of all to 2 Corinthians chapter 11 so you'll see that it is not a problem of the 21st century. It was there right from the beginning.",

Brethren can determine if they are legalists by analyzing whether there is a disparity between their church life, and their private life.  Just like Moses had to hide his face so people could not see God's glory fading, legalists will have to hide parts of their lives from others.  The solution?  The life and the liberty of the Spirit!  The ultimate test of a legalist: \"Do you love rules more than you love people, or do you love people more than you love rules?\"",

Brother Zac points out in this sermon how salvation is completely free, but there are things in Christianity that will cost us.  Can you be so lost in ministry that you lose a meal? Suffer persecution?  While emphasizing that we must be victorious in these areas we are encouraged to accept the concept of steady progress over these sins as is shown to be a thematic of New Covenant faith.",

We cannot limit Jesus suffering to mere physical suffering, otherwise sin could be dealt with and atoned for with every human death, and that would be sufficient for entrance into heaven.  With a true understanding and acknowledgment of the spiritual and infinite sufferings of Christ should also come a truth which breaks us free from our love of sin.  If we only ever see God as a means to our physical need, then we are missing the point of the New Covenant entirely.  Brother Poonen also ties a heavy rock to the idea that Jesus suffered in Hell for three days while dead, and casts it into the deepest sea.",

He offers a balanced view on how to determine what soulishness is, and says that we must learn to allow the sword of the spirit to divide that which is of the soul from that which is of the Spirit, in order that we may fly out of this snare.",

This message serves as a gentle warning in love to many who have strong convictions that go past what God calls and leads. We need zealous strong individuals that display the compassion of God but a unyielding desire for truth. The true body of Christ should fulfill the same function as Jesus did while on earth--exposing unreality and religious hypocrisy.  As Zac has studied many groups in Christendom that majored on holiness, all of their mistakes could be summed up in one thing: pharisaism.  Many precious principles are put forth that we may ask the question: \"Am I really presenting Christ correctly?\"",

We can learn to take heed to the many warnings from the lives of great men like David, Solomon, Elijah and others.    Imagine a book that begins with David and ends with Ahab!  The book of Kings shows how important God's leaders affect the spiritual state of God's people.  What could have been the result in Solomon's life had David last words been about marriage and godly leadership rather than revenge?  Solomon teaches us about spiritual discernment and misdirected energies that end in destruction.  Elijah gives various insights into the boldness that comes from God's presence and looking away from crows to God alone in spite of human weaknesses and frailties.",
