The Saints Sensitive Heart (they all said \"is it I?\") 2. The Social Gospel (all the teaching and example of Christ is not enough to save the soul and sin is not in the fact that Judas did not follow protocol but that his heart was not right) 3. The Sinner's Hypocrisy (Judas has become a proverb for treachery and betrayal, but Christ exposes the heart).",

        "description": "In this difficult and often misunderstood passage John is considering the seriousness of continuing in sin. The outline of the passage: Originating with Satan (Vs. 8) and practiced by men (Vs. 4, 6-10) sin is lawlessness against God (Vs. 4). Christ came to take away sin (Vs. 5) and destroy the work of the devil (Vs. 8). The logical conclusion is that whoever is born of God (Vs. 9) and consequently abides in Him (Vs. 6) does not go on sinning and whoever does go on sinning has not seen God and has not known him (V. 6); he is not of God (Vs. 10).",

        "description": "In Vs. 8 John deals with the source of habitual sin, in particular from the perspective of man, as the practitioner of sin. Man is responsible for sin. There is a trend today in modern charismatic circles to exorcise Satan when sin appears in the life; sin is attributed entirely to Satan as though man was the helpless victim. This trend diminishes the doctrine of Total Depravity and also the responsibility of man for his own actions. John does not regard sin as the devil working through the individual, but as the individual working for the devil and in his sin representing the devil. Sin is not a mere infirmity; it is not merely an imposition of Satan on us. John is emphasising that habitual sin is wilful lawlessness against God (Vs. 4) and the man who continues to sin is not at liberty to say \u2018the devil made me do it' by direct involvement.",
