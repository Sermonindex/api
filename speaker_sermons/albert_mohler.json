        "description": "Mohler began by describing the current landscape of the American church\u2014we need a recovery of understanding the Scriptures in their totality. He expounded Jesus\u2019 dialogue with the Pharisees in John 5 with specific application for us. The Pharisees\u2019 rejection of Jesus was a refusal to recognize God\u2019s witness of him. The takeaway for us is important: one can study the Scriptures extensively and not get it.",
