This stirring account grabs your attention as Dr. Culpepper relates the fascinating behind-the-scenes account of his own experience as well as the larger picture. This moving and powerful personal account by Southern Baptist missionary C.L. Culpepper of the Shantung Revival in China in the 1920's (one of the most remarkable mass moving of the Holy Spirit in history) continues to move and convict me each time I listen.",
