What is meant to harm us turns out to make us exclaim like Hezekiah in Isaiah 38 that \u201csurely it was for my benefit that I suffered such anguish\u201d. We are still in this very rich verse that has spoken comfort to millions of Christians around the world and right across history\u2014Romans 8:28.",

        "description": "Conrad Mbewe highlighted some important insights on leadership in Jeremiah 23. The failure of Israel\u2019s leaders led to their people\u2019s idolatry. Rather than Israel\u2019s leaders being a means of blessing, they were instead a means of judgment. But the God of the universe would not allow his agenda to be highjacked by ungodly leaders. God promised that he would send a Someone to lead His people, raising up a righteous Branch who would reign as a wise king. Who is this Person? You don\u2019t have to search far to find out who this Someone is: Jesus of Nazareth.",
