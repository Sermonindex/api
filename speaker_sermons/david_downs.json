        "description": "The topic of this sermon deals with God's wrath being satisfied on the Cross. People do not take their sins seriously. Because many do not take sin seriously, they do not take the cross seriously and therefore the wrath of God seriously. This is a very practical, clear, strong exhortation and teaching to understand the wrath of God in Scriptures.",
