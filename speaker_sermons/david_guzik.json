This day the Israelite army needed their physical strength to totally wipe out the oppresive Philistines but they had none due to Sauls fast.  Jonathan however had not taken the oath to fast because he had been off fighting the Philistines with his armour bearer, so he came back and ate some honey, which was when he was challenged by one of the people, and when he heard this he said how wrong his father had been and told of how if it wasn't for his fathers fast they would have defeated the Philistines in a mighty way.  Saul had sinned greatly against the Lord in this and thus when he went to enquire of the Lord what he should do the Lord would not answer him.",

Samuel the prophet takes Saul, the future king, and anoints him king privately and in a way that shows how the Lord wants to anoint every believer with the Holy Ghost, how He should fill our lives.  The Lord then confirms that Saul is to be made king by giving Saul 3 very specific signs.  The last sign was that thje Holy Ghost would come upon Saul and change him into a new man as spiritual confirmation of the physical anointing that Saul had received.  So Saul was turned into another man, Samuel gathered all the people of Israel together and revealed Saul as their future king and the people rejoiced because he 'looked the part' but Samuel knew that Saul had very little spiritual subsatnce.",

He stands before the people and asks them to declare if he has ever wronged them or defrauded them or let them down in any way, which is a challenging thing for a leader to do before their people.  The people respond and say that Samuel has not wronged them at any time.  By this public challenge Samuel confirmed that he was passing on a good legacy to Saul and that if the nation went downhill from their it was not Samuels fault.  He declares to them all the righteous acts that the Lord has done to them how He brought them out of Egypt, raised up judges to rule over them and taught them discipline through affliction.  He recalls the events that effected the nation of Israel right up to the battle with Nahash in the previous chapter and shows the people the big picture of how the Lord has been faithful to them.",

David however does not approach Saul to discuss a dowery and so Saul offers his daughter to another man in order that he might make David jelous.  But David keeps a pure heart before the Lord and actually wins a victory by being submissive and humble before the Lord.  David also did not suspect that Saul had ulterior motives in offering his daughter to David. Then Sauls youngest daughter Michal fell in love with David and this pleased Saul as he could again manipulate this situation for David's hurt, so Saul proposes a price for his daughter, 100 Philistine foreskins, knowing that it was highly likely that David would be killed in meeting the price, however the Lord was with David and delivered him 200 Philistine foreskins.  This extra effort is straight out of the teaching of the Lord Jesus who commanded to 'go the second mile' and thus show a humility and a servants heart, which David surely had.",

She exalts the King, the Anointed One, the Messiah and was the first person to proclaim the God would be the Messiah a theme that was later shwon through all the prophets but Hannah saw it first.  There isw a shift in this passage though in the form of the corrupt sons of the high priest Eli, who didn't know the Lord and by their actions were causing the people of God to hate offering to God as the people knew that the priesthood was so corrupt.  Samuel however served the Lord as a small child and was dressed in priests clothes that his mother would make for him and bring to Shiloh every year, and the Lord further blessed her with 3 more sons and 2 daughters.",

However this did not concern Jonathan and his armour bearer one bit, they saw a big enemy but a bigger God and with one of the Bibles great faith exercises went up against the local philistine garrison believing that God could deliver them into their hand.  Jonathan as a man of God knew that the Lord could save wether by many or by few, He was not hindered in the least by numbers.  Jonathans armour bearer was loyal to his master and went all the way with him believing the Lord the same way.  Jonathan just before going up to the philistines asked the Lord for one last sign that this was of Him, and he received confirmation and declared victory before even meeting his foe.  This is a mighty lesson for us to learn that truelly if God is for us then who dare be against us.  The Lord delivered just 20 men into their hand but the whole became afraid and started turning on each other.",

Hannah is greived because she is barren, a situation which was possibly the worst place a woman could be in the Old Testament.  Every year Elkanah and his two wives would go up to Shiloh to the feast and Peninnah would mock Hannah becasue she had not children and Peninnah did.  This caused incredible sorrow in the heart of Hannah, but she did the right thing and poured out her grief before the Lord.  She made a vow to the Lord that if He would give her a son she would dedicate him to the Lord in a deeper and stronger way be seperating him as a Nazerite to the Lord, the remarkable moment came when after she had grieved before the Lord her sorrow left her and her faith in God was restored, did she concieve that moment? no, but God's word was just as sure and she praised Him for it. The Lord opened her womb and she gave birth to one of the most remarkable men in the Bible, Samuel.",

David goes to the tabernacle of God at Nob, to Ahimelech the priest, this was th right thing to for David to do to go to the house of the Lord.  But when he is asked what is going on by Ahimelech David lies to him several times in order to protect himself and maybe also Ahimelech from Saul.  David asks the priest for food, and all that is available is the shew bread which was used in the tabernacle to symbolize how the Lord desires to have fellowship with us.  So Ahimelech gives David the shewbread even though it was usually eaten by the priests, this shows that serving a human need is of greater importance than observing priestly traditions.  Does the Edomite, a servant of Saul was there and witnessed what was happening.  Finally David asks for a weapon from Ahimelech and he gioves him Goliaths sword, which David takes, the Lord was probably reminding David that the last time he held that sword he won a great victory as he was in the will of God and didn't need to resort to the flesh to deliver him.",

        "description": "David was disparing that one day Saul would kill him and so made up his mind to escape, leave the people of God and go and live amongst the ungodly Philistines.  t this point David was so low that he had forgotten the promises of the Lord towards him how he would one day be king and that Saul would not take his life.  However David did not go alone to Gath in Philistia but took all his men and their families with him,  so much depends upon godly leaders walking with the Lord that when they depart from the way many folow them.  David goes to the king of Gath and asks for a city to dwell in and the king gives him Ziklag, for this David declared himself to be a servant of the king, what a sad time this must have been, that the champion of the armies of Israel was now the servant of the king of the philistines.  During this time David leared to play the instrument of Gath as ssen in the titels of Psalm 8, 84 and 87 but he didn't write any Psalms to the Lord during this time, sadly he became a marauder and attacked cities and robbed their dead.",

After this time the people begin to lament, yes they have the Ark back but the prescence of the Lord is still absent and they know this so they began at last to seek the God of the Ark.  The Lord sends Samuel to them who speaks to them what is in the heart of God, they should turn away from their idolatry and worship of Baal and Ashtaroth, who are the modern gods of money and sex.  The people heeded the word of the Lord and put away the idolatry and repented and lamented over their sin before to Lord.  The Philistines saw this as a sign of weakness and decided they would finally defeat the Israelites.  But the Lord was on their side now and the Philistines couldn't even get to the battle before the Lord struck them with fear and the Israelites won without even going into battle.",

He was a man with all the right looks and yet had very little susbstance.  Saul here is helping out his father who has lost his donkeys, so Saul and his servant head out to find the donkeys, with no knowledge of what is about to befall them.  They wander from town to town asking and looking after the donkeys until they get to a certain town and decide to ask the prophet who is their if he knows where the donkeys are.  This shows Saul had little spiritual substance as he doesn't even recongise Samuel the prophet, and has no intention of asking him about his own spiritual condition, but is only interested inthe location of the lost donkeys.  The first thing Samuel tells Saul is that he will reveal to Saul what God has planned for his life, and then straight after tells him where the lost donkeys are,without Saul even asking.  So Samuel invites Saul to a feast and puts him in the place of most prominence and tells him that he is the future king of Israel!!",

This was a very strange thing for David to do as he has also killed thousands of Philistines, as well as Goliath.  So David is captured by them and imprisoned.  David knowing he has done wrong does the right thing and cries out to God, this is when he wrote Psalm 56 and it can be seen in this Psalm how David's heart is turned back to the Lord as he cries out for mercy.  He is then brought before Achish the king, David pretends to be mad which must have taken great humility to act that way before his enemies so Achish releases David and on his way from Gath David praises the Lord mightily, Psalm 34.  The Lord showed His love to David even though David did not deserve it, which shows the great love and mercy of God.  David then heads for the cave of Adullam from which you can see the valley where David slew Goliath and David lamented and wrote Palm 142.",

Dabid had spent his life thus far being obedient out in the fields looking after the sheep and drawing close to God, he had also been in a few fights with wild animals from which the Lord had delivered him, thus David trusted in the Lord.

The servants of Saul knew what had happened to him and asked if they should bring someone to worship the Lord before the king and lift his mood.  So they went out and found David who was a skillful player of the harp and was already described as a man of war both in the sphere of physical and spiritual warfare.

David arrives and plays and worships the Lord before Saul, but this time Saul is not pacified and responds with violence and attempts to kill David by throwing a spear at him.  Somehow either by Saul's bad aim or by David's quickness the spear misses him, and David esacpes, this amazingly he does twice, how many of us would have gone back into that environment knowing that the second time it could mean our very lives.  David though even though he was a mighty warrior who could have retaliated and killed Saul, did not fight back but instead escaped knowing that the Lord would avenge him of Saul.  So Saul then made David leader of an elite group of men thinking that David would be killed on the battle field by the Philistines, but David remained wise before the Lord and He kept him, and David, to Sauls great dismay, grew even more popular with the people as the Lord blessed him.",

So David and his men go to hide in the wilderness on Engedi, but the sscouts see Saul coming towards them with 3000 men.  So David and his band hide deep in the back of one of the caves, Saul and his men are about to pass by the cave when they stop and Saul comes into the cave alone.  David's men compel him to kill Saul, so David quietly sneeks up to where Saul is and cuts of a piece of his robe and returns to his men.  Saul leaves the cave and Davids men cannot believe that he didn't kill Saul.  But David because of his tender heart before the Lord goes even further and, walks out of the cave and crys to Saul in great humility.  He declares that he does not want to kill Saul as some people think and as proof shows Saul the piece of the robe he cut off, Saul seeing this repents for wanting to kill David and goes home, but David returns to his stronghold, in case Saul changes his mind again.",

Abishai who is with David in the midst of the camp requests that David give him permission to plunge Saul's own spear, which is stuck in the ground near his head, through his heart, Abishai says he only needs one chance and he will kill Saul there and then.  But David still shows great mercy to Saul, in that he wont allow Abishai to do it, so they take the spar and the jug that is near Saul and leave the camp.  David then when he is a long way away cries to Abner, and accuses him of not being vigilent for his king and shows the spear and the jug.  Saul again realising that David could have easily killed him realises his wrong again and asks for David to forgive him, which David does, showing the principle that the Lord Jesus laid down that if someone sins against us we are to forgive everytime.

Jonathan gives a good account of David to Saul and Saul repents of the wrong that he wanted to do to David,  Saul voowes that David shall not be kiled, which ironically was true as he wouldn't be killed by Saul.

This was the high point of David and Sauls relationship, Saul sent David out to fight the Philistines, and David won a resounding victory, becaue the Lord was with him, but the people began to love David more than Saul and this caused Saul to become Jealous and he became suspicious of David from that day on, David on the other hand did not get proud but acted wisely before the Lord.",

However it wasn't long before the men of Bethshemesh became curious to know what was actually in the Ark, so they opened it and the Lord kiled them for it.  This shows that there are some things that God has chosen not to reveal to us and it is sin to press God to try an find out things that He does not want to reveal to us.  This judgement lead to a great fear spreading over the people as they realized the holiness of God, that God is not man and is far beyond us and thus is seperate from us.  This is what attracts people to God because He is beyond us, but when people come to know Him and see his holiness and 'otherness' we become fearful as we are not holy before a holy God.

After suffering a crushing defeat of 4000 men the leaders of Israel tried to persuade god to fight for them by bringing the Ark of the Covenant, this was a great mistake as they put their faith in the Ark of God and not in the God of the Ark.  This displayed the vain superstitions the people of Israel were embracing at the time.  The priests that brough the Ark tio the camp were the two sons of Eli who the Lord had already declared were under judgement.  When the Ark arrived their was a great shout in the camp and the Philistines became afraid as they knew that the Ark represented the God of Israel and that He was mightier than their gods, but despite this they did not submit to Him but fought the more viciously against the Israelites.  Becasue God was not with Israelites they not only lost awefully but the Ark was taken and the sons of Eli were killed in the smae day, just as the Lord had said would happen.",

Eli asked Samuel what the Lord had said and Samuel told him everything.  He chose to obey the Lord over popularity.  Saul was anointed king over Israel but in a moment of panic offered a sacrifice to the Lord which was forbidden to do, when Samuel, now the prophet of God, challenged him Saul chose to make excuses for his actions instead of repenting.  David was a man after God's own heart and chose to love the Lord when he was alone with the sheep in the fields where there were none to see him, David still a boy became and man of God and most likely in this time wrote Psalm 23.",

They had learned lesson from their Biblical history in that would no longer harden their hearts towards the Lord as the Egyptians had done inb the time of Moses.  But before sending the Ark back they decided to perform on last test to see if what had happened was at the hand of the Lord or all the events had just happened by chance.  They placed the Ark on a cart pulled by 2 milk cows, which had never pulled anything before in their lives, they took the cows from their calves, set them on a road they had never been on and sent them away with no driver.  The philistines had 'stacked the deck' against God to see if it was actually Him who had punished them for these 7 months.  So they stood back and watched in amazement as the cows took the exact route to Bethshemesh guided by the invisible hand of Almighty God, God will get His glory even if He has to glorify Himself.",

Nabal on the other hand is totally unaware of what could have happened and is throwing a party when Abigail returns, the morning after she tells him of the previous days events and he is so shocked that he dies 10 days later.  David sends fo Abigail and takes her and Ahinoam for his wives as Sauls daughter had been given to someone else.",

Because they went unpunished by their father the Lord had to judge them for their actions.  On day a man sent from God came to the house of Eli and confronted him about his sons behaviour because God held him responsible for what his sons were doing, the man of God gave Eli, and his sons and invitation to repent before judgement came but they didn't thus judgement had to come in the deaths of Eli's sons adn the removal of Eli's family from the preisthood in the days of Zadok about 70 years later.  During this time Samuel was growing in favour of God and man and thus the Lord spoke to him even though Samuel didn't know it was the Lord, he went to Eli and Eli told him it was the Lord and Samuel recieved the word with gladness.",

        "description": "Here we are introduced to one of the great men in this book of 1 Samuel, Jonathan who was a remarkable military leader and also son of Saul the king.  Jonathan leads an army against the local philistine garrison and wins a resounding victory, even though Saul his father took the credit for it, but the philistines didn't like this at all and decided to amass an army to put down this 'rebellion' in the people of Israel who they oppessed.  the people of Israel were fearful before going into battle and realised they need the Lord to fight for them, so Saul calls for Samuel to offer a sacrifice and bless them before the battle.  After a few days of Samuel not coming to offer the sacrifice Saul decides to off the sacrifice himself, which was a major sin as he was a king not a priest, and just after the sacrifice is offered Samuel comes over the hill to find to his horror Saul has not waited for him, and thus not waited for the Lord's timing.  Samuel offers Saul an opportunity to repent but instead he makes excuses, so Samuel tells him that the Lord has rejected him as king and has found a man after His own heart to rule the people.",

So Saul not knowing what to do goes to enquire of the Lord, but the Lord wouldn't answer him either by dreams, Urim or prophets, this is because Saul had been in open rebellion to the Lord for years now andhad departed from Him.  So Saul panics and seeks a medium who would give him advice.  So the servants of Saul tell him of a woman in Endor, so Saul disguises himself and goes to her and asks her to bring up Samuel the prophet from the dead, and when Samuel comes the medium is terrified and realises who Saul is.  Samuel asks Saul why he has brought him up and Saul says that the Lord has departed from him, when really Saul had departed from the Lord, and he doesn't know what to do, but Samuel reminds Saul that the Lord had promised to tear the kingdom out of his hands and that is just what is going to happen because the time that had elapsed had not atoned for Saul's sin.  So Samuel tells Saul that the day after he would die and gave Saul one last chance to repent, but he didn't.",

So the Israelites came to him and told him that they rejected his sons from ruling over them because of their ungodly lives, however instead of his sons they wanted a king to rule over them instead, the reason for this lay in their desire to be just like the surrounding nations, it is very dangerous for the people of God to want to be like the those in the world around them.  Samuel was saddened by this decision from the people and poured out his complaint before the Lord, as we should do.  But the Lord reassured Samuel and told him that that it wasn't him they were rejecting but the Lord Himself.  This was prophetic of the rejection of the Lord Jesus by the the people of Israel before Pilate.  So the Lord told Samuel to tell the people of Israel what kind of king they would have, and he did, but the people still demanded a king and so the Lord gave them the king they deserved.",

Goliath was mountain of a man some say he was aroung 9ft tall, and this is reflected in the size and weight of his armour, he was a man of war from his youth and was in the philistine army army for one reason, to instill fear into their enemies.  On the first day of battle Goliath headed out and stood before the army of Israel and challenged them to send out one man to fight with him, one on one, and this terrified the Israelites and their king Saul, who was the tallest in their army.  Satan today uses the exact same tactics as Goliath did in that he roars at us and makes us afraid when God is on our side and there is no reason to fear what he or man might do to us.  David arrives at the battle to bring supplies to his brothers who were in the army at the time and hears Goliath's challenge, but David instead of seeing Goliaths size and armour saw an uncircumsized idolater who was defying the living God, David knew this was a cause worth fighting for so he accepted Goliaths challenge.",

He asked his servants who this woman was only to be told that not only was she the daughter and granddaughter of some of Davids closest advisers, but was also married to one of the mighty men in Davids army.  So he knew that her husband was away and thought he could get away with adultery, so they had a 'one night stand' but Bathsheba became pregnant.",

The first person to meet him at his return was the repentant Shimei who had cursed David and throne rocks at him when he was fleeing from Jerusalem. But now Shimei begged Davids forgiveness for what he had done, and David mercifully granted him a pardon.  The Mephibosheth came to David and told him of how Ziba had tricked him and lied to David about him, David told Mephibosheth that he copuld divide the land with Ziba but Mephibosheth only wanted to be with his king he wasn't interested in the land. But at the end of this chapter the seeds were sown for a great dispute between Judah and Israel.",

        "description": "Bathsheba was now pregnant by an adulterous relationship with David, and David knew it so he endeavoured to hide his sin by calling Bathsheba's husband Uriah back from the war.  David asked Uriah how the battle was going and told him to go home and relax with his wife, but Uriah was a man of great integrity and refused to go home to be comfortable with his wife while Israel was at war.  So David sent him back to the front with a note for Joab his commander to place Uriah in the heat of the battle and withdraw from him, sentencing Uriah to death.  Joab obeyed the command of David and Uriah was killed in battle, David later took Bathsheba to be his wife in order to cover up what he had done but this displeased the Lord.  David had ignored the warnings of the Lord and temptation had turned to lust, lust to adultery, adultery to deception and finally into murder, this is how our sin if unchecked can uncontollably accumulate until it utterly blinds us and only the Lord can save us.",

Absalom in the meatime is asking advise from Ahithophel who was the wisest man in Israel at the time, Ahithophel advises Abslaom to burn his bridges with his father the king by systematically raping 10 of the kings concubines whom David had left behind, but not only this but to do it on the roof of the palace so everyone knew what he was doing.  Absalom followed this advice.  Ahithophel, who hated David due to the fact that he was Bathsehba's grandfather, then asked Absalom if he could lead a band of men immediately and go after David and kill him, this was a brilliant plan and had it not been for the intervention of the Lord would surely have meant the end of David.  Amazingly though Absaom asked for a second oppinion from Hushai the Archite, he appealed to Absalom's vanity and advised him to amass a great army and lead them out to battle, thus buying the king time, Absalom agreed with Hushai's plan and Ahithophel knowing it would lead to ruin returned home and hanged himself as he knew David would succeed and come after him.",

He defeated the Philistines who were an old and stubborn enemy, just as Satan is an old and stubborn enemy of ours, but the Lord will win the resounding victory.  He defeated Moab with great severity as much severity as we are, through Christ, to defeat the sin that is in our lives.  He also defeated the Syrian alliance who had come against him and so Christ shall one day utterly defeat the alliance of sin, the flesh and the devil.  We can learn from this passage of scripture that David defeated his enemies that were all around him just as the Lord desires to defeat all the enemies that surround us.",

This is a testament to how fallen man will rebel against God-ordained authority at every opurtunity he can get.  So David aksed his new chief general Amasa to amas an army in three days and pursue Sheba, but Amasa had trouble amasing the army so David sent Abishai and the palace guard with Joab to pursue Sheba.  As they were pursuing Amasa caught up with them but Joab killed him, probably due to Amasa being Absaloms chief commander when he was alive.  So the guards carried on and came to the city of Abel where Sheba now was thinking himself to be safe. Joab and all the men laid seige to the city, but a wise woman from the city asked Joab why he was laying seige to the city, JOab told her tha he would leave once he knew Sheba was dead so she consulted the people of the city and they killed Sheba and threw his head over the wall and Joab and the army returned to Jerusalem.",

But he showed David the crown and bracelet that he had taken from Saul after his death, David was very grieved to hear the news and wrote a lamentation about Saul and Jonathan, this shows how David was free from the bitterness that would have ensnared his heart had he dwelt upon how Saul had wronged him. But David asks the Amalekite why he was not afraid to kill the anointed king of Israel and when the he didn't answer David had him killed for boasting over the dead.",

It was highly likely that the famine and the war would not have touched David directly so he chose the punishment of the plague.

        "description": "David asks if there is anyone left frm the house of Saulthat he might show to them the kindness of God, so he calls a servant of Saul to him and aks if there is anyone, the servant informs him of Mephibosheth who was the son of Jonathan, David's close friend, but the servant also informs David that Mephibosheth is lame in both his feet thus posing no threat to David's rule over Israel.  David send for Mephibosheth anyway, and he must have been terrified that David would kill him as he had been in hiding for years, but David did indeed show to him the kindness of God as he gave him back all Saul's land, said that he would not kill him, and told him that from that day on he would be welcome to eat at the table of the king.  This of course is a wonderful picture of our relationship to the Lord Jesus who has forgiven us, given us back more than we lost in Adam and invites us always to dine at His table, with Him.  What a God we serve.",

He reflected on how the Lord had blessed him so abundantly throughout his life, and shows how close David was to the Lord, how the Lord delighted in him and how he delighted in the Lord.  To David God was the Goal not a Way to the goal as He so often is today.  David also had around him his mighty men who had first joined him in the cave of Adullam when they were weak afraid and in debt, but now the they were mighty through God, as they had learned to love the Lord and had gone out and won great victories.  In chapter 24 Satan tempted David to number all of Israel in order to see how strong he was in the natural but this was a thing which the Lord had expressly forbidden.",

So the king and his wayward son finally met, but Absalom was unrepentant for killing his brother Amnon.  Absalom then set about slowely turning the heart of the people away from David and towards himself, it was only a matter of time before the people began to follow him.  A few years after Absalom went to Hebron where he decalred himself to be the new king of Israel, when David heard about this he did not defend his throne but was happy to let the things of this world go.  But he had to flee because he knew Absalom would be intent on killing him.  The only people that were with David at this time were a group of loyal foreigners, whome he cared for and the preist of the Lord led by Zadok.",

The if this wasn't bad enough for David to be fleeing from his own son and to hear, wrongfully, that one of his most trusted friends has betrayed him a distant relation of Saul comes to him called Shimei, and starts cursing David and saying all this has come upono him because of what he did to the Saul when he was still alive.  Davids men who are with him ask for permission to kill Shimei but David is merciful towards him saying, that Absalom is what they should be concerned with and not the misguided insults of some distant relation of Saul, thus David again showed great mercy to the house of Saul and triumphed wonderfully in the face of adversity",

In this vision the lion depicts the empire of Babylon that overwhelmed it's enemies like a lion overwhelms it's prey, but this lion was brought low and humbled just like Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon.  The bear depicts the Medo-Persian empire that was slower in conquest than the Babylonian empire but was very crushing in the way it dominated it's enemies, inerestingly Daniel says this beast was raised up on one side and this is because the Persians were more dominant than the Medes' in the alliance.  The third beast is a four winged leopard which shows speed this beast depicts the greek empire under Alexander the great that conquered most of the known world in just 12 years, the beast also has 4 heads and Alexander divided his kingdom between his 4 generals.  The forth beast is different to all other beasts and represents the roman empire, however this beast hasn't been completely destroyed and is still around in the form of the European Union from which David Guzik believes the anitchrist (little horn in this chapter) will arise.  The final empire is the reign of Christ after his scond coming, this kingdom Jesus will give to his saints, notice it is given to them not earned by them.",

        "description": "the Eigth chapter of Daniel is a passage in the Bible so outstanding in it's historical fulfillment that many liberal scholars think that it could not possibly have been written by Daniel because it reveals future events in such detail.  The ram's horns represent the kings of Media and Persia.  The goat represents the grecian empire and it's one mighty horn Alexander the great, who split his kingdom into 4 parts at his death at the age of only 32 years old. Out of these 4 rulers arose 1 called Antiochus Epiphanes who behaved abhorently towards the jews, he defiled the temple by erecting a statue of Zeus and slaughtering a pig on the altar, he was also responsible for the murder of possibly 100,000 Jews, and is called by many comentators'the antichrist of the Old Testament'.  The cultural influence of the greek empire was massive though, and still greatly influences modern thought even more than 2000 years later.  The hand of the Lord was in this huge influence of greek thinking though in that by the time Jesus came to the world the whole of civilization spoke one language, greek, and hence Paul could go anywhere in the civilized world and preach in greek and be understood.",

In this passage we read of an angel coming to Daniel to answer his prayer on the very day that Daniel lifted his hands up to the Lord God , yet this angel was resisted and hindered by demonic forces within the spirit realm, thus the answer didn't get through to Daniel till the 21st day, this is a great lesson in persistent and prevailing prayer as the answer would not have come to Daniel if he had given up on the 19th day, the angelic messenger was of course helped by Micheal who seems to have a protective role over the nation of Israel.  In the prophetic vision that is revealed to Daniel the king of the north is the king of Syria and the king of the south the king of Egypt, historically these 2 kings were 2 of Alexander the greats generals which have been mentioned before, and Israel was caught inbetween their disputes, this was just before the reign of Antiochus, the antichristn of the Old Testament.",

        "description": "Daniel 9 is one of the most incredible prophecies in the whole of the Bible because of it's accuracy in fulfillment, Daniel in this passge is reading his Bible, specifically Jeremiah, he reads about how the people of Israel will go into captivity for 70 years and realises he is living in the fullfilment of that prophecy, Daniel believed the Bible literally and thus the 70 years he read about in the book of Jeremiah he believed was 70 years in reality.  Daniel is moved by what he reads and begins to intercede for the his people, he prays that the Lord would take this 70 years from the first move into captivity in 605BC and not 597BC.  Daniel was the 'chief of staff' for Babylon and still had time to pray in this incredible way, he set his face to seek the Lord and begn to repent for the sins of Israel and he begged the Lord to turn away His anger from His people and for the sake of His own righteousness restore His people.  The Lord answered Daniel's prayer.",

By this time Daniel was probably around 80 years old and yet still had faultless integrity to the degree that the enemies of this man of God couldn't find any skeletons in his closet even after more than 50 years in civil service.  They came to the conclusion that they would only trap Daniel because of his faithfulness to God, so they got Darius to pass a decree that no one should pray to any god except him for 30 days. In the face of this Daniel did the safest thing he could.. exactly what he had always done and stayed faithful to God.  For this Daniel was condemned to be cast into the den of lions, the night he was in the den Darius neither slept nor ate, Daniel prayed as it was his custom to pray 3 times a day.  We find that in this remarkable occasion Daniel was kept due to his habitual lifestyle, he remained faithful to God and the Lord blessed him for it.",

The prophecy laid out here will have it's fulfillment in the end times, it will be a period of 3 and a half years and will be so intense that it will cause the people of Israel to cry out to their Messiah and He will return and defend them from the last onslaught.  Interestingly Pastor Guzik says that 'running to and fro and knowledge shall increase' speaks of the huge explosion in understanding of Biblical prophecy that has occured in the past 100 years.",

The wisemen couldn't answer so the king orders for all his councilers to be executed.  When the captain of the guard arrives at Daniels house, Daniel bravely asks for time to seek the God of Heaven in order to tell the king what he desires to know, the king gives him time and the Lord gives Daniel the answer, so Daniel reveals the dream and interpretation to the king. The gold head represents the Babylonian empire, the silver arms and chest represent the Medo-Persian empire, the bronze belly represents the Greek empire, the Iron legs the Roman empire and the iron and clay feet are yet to be revealed.  One thing is for sure though the Stone not cut with hands that destroys the image is the Lord Jesus whose kingdom will be established forever.",

Daniel was amongst these taken as he was one of the young shining lights of the people of Israel, they were taken so that they might be indctrinated into the Babylonian way of thinking and work for the king in his civil service, of course they were also taken as hostages.  The young men of Israle were given new names, each to do with a Babylonian god, a good education and meat from the kings table, this last thing daniel politely refused as eating such things would have made him spiritually impure.  The refusal to eat the food offered could have carried with it a death sentence but Daniel took the responsability upon himself so as not to endanger the chief eunuch, Daniel and his companions gave themselves to the Lord in a remarkable way and the Lord blessed them in return in a remarkable way.",

Gabriel reveals to Daniel that there will be a period of 490 years that will concern the Jews and particularly the city of Jerusalem.  The prophecy began to be fulfilled in 445BC at the decree of Cyrus to rebuild the city of Jerusalem.  483 Jewish years (360 days) later was the exact that the Lord Jesus rode into Jerusalem on the donkey, but as predicted the Messiah was executed and the temple destoyed.  So we await the fulfillment of Daniels 70th week, when the Antichrist will confirm a covenant with the jews, his people destroyed the temple and Jerusalem before he even came to the world, many believe he will probably be European.",

Again he has a disturbing dream and calls for his councillors and yet calls Daniel last, and how is this a type of us today, when trouble comes we go to all the ends of the earth seeking council without asking what God has to say about the situation.  In his dream he sees a great tree that provides everything that the world needs, he then sees an angelic being saying 'cut it down'. Everyone knew what this dream meant yet only Daniel probably with a heavy heart and tears in his eyes would tell the king, Daniel implured him to repent yet even through this he didn't and thus fell mightily he probably went mad and for seven years ate grass like an ox.  Interestingly in secular Babylonian history there is a seven year preiod where there were no royal decrees. This passage teaches us that if we do not humble ourselves then God will do it because He will not share His glory with anyone.",

But God decides to 'crash' this party  and manifests a disembodied hand to write on the wall, this terrifies the king and he calls for Daniel to interpret the writing.  This is a type of how the world seek out the children of God when 'the writing is on their walls'.  Belshazzar offers Daniel riches and power but Daniel isn't interested and rebukes Belshazzar saying that he should have humbled himself like Nebuchadnezzar, but because he hadn't the kingdom would be taken from him and divided, and this was fullfilled that very night when Darius' army stormed Babylon",

The three Hebrew men Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego would not bow to the image as it violated the second commandment, they knew the penalty would probably have resulted in their death yet they obeyed God and not man.  They faced tremendous pressure when brought before the king himself and asked if the allegations of their 'betrayel' were true, they stuck to their ground and told him they wouldn't bow and that God could deliver them even out of Nebuchadnezzars hand.  For this they were cast into the firey furnace, here the original text implies that they began to sing and praise the Lord and Nebuchadnezzar saw the Lord Jesus with them in the midst of the fiery trial, there is nothing in the text to shwo that they saw the Lord there, but He was there and the trial only served to release them from their bondage.",

It is an immensely practical teaching encouraging self-examination and personal restoration to broadening one's prayer life for others.  He tackles theological debates on how revival comes, \"Is it just a soverign work of God?\" or \"Is it the right use of appropriate means?\"  Guzik cited a number of fascinating examples from J. Edwin Orr's book about the Second Great Awakening in Britain.",

Philosophical challenges arose in the enlightenment, which was very man centred, people began to ask how man could improve the world and rationalism became popular and placed mans powers of reason above the Bible.  In this time there was also the rise of scientism, secularism and also theological liberalism which is almost now dead in it's original form as it substitutes feelings for truth.  There were also great social reforms the abolition of slavery, prohibtion and womens rights, the missionary movement really took off in the 19th century as transportation was revolutionised and this lead to the idea that the 20th century would be known as the 'christain century'.",

The reformation lead to revolutions in the way people thought and the diea they had but had little initial impact on the way people lived it was because of this the Luther sadly died a discouraged man. The rise of the Anglican church was instigated by Henry VIII in England, who previously had actually written tracts against Luther and reformed thinking and for this reaons was given the Title of 'Defender of the Faith' by the Pope!  However for politcial not theological reasons Henry broke from the chutch of Rome and became head of the Anglican church which was Protestant in theology yet Roman Catholic in ceremony.",

While Luther was abscent from his church in Wittenberg he was replaced by his co-pastor who was zealous for reform and implimented the ordinances he read about in the Bible, such as communion.  When Luther returned he rebuked his co-pastor who was only following in Luthers own steps but a bit to energetically for Luther.  The Anabaptists were radical reformers who wanted to reform the quickly they read in the scriptures that the church was a called out peple and thus opposed the movemnts of the time that called for church and state to be united.",

But the Church came and challenged Luther and his beliefs but the more the pushed against him and his theology the more Luther resisted and became convinced of it's truth.  Because of this coubts crept into Luthers mmind, not about what he found in the scriptures but about the pope and the doctrine that were coming out of the church.  In 1521 a council was assembled called 'The Diet of Worms' it was presided over by Emperor Charles V and gave Luther the opertunity to recant what he had written, he didn't.  Luther was released but the Emperor decreed that anyone who helped Luther from then on would be excomunicated, when he returned to Germany he translated the Bible into German, a version which is still used today, a german KJV if you will.  In 1530 Luther was given one last chance to recant he didn't and the division between Catholocism and Lutherism was finalized.",

However due to a vow to Saint Barbara, patron saint of miners, he became a monk and applied his legal mind to theology, he saw the Lord as righteous Judge of the whole creation and thus was zealous to live a holy life.  In 1510 he went to Rome, as he was disillusioned with the way the church was in Germany, there he became even more concerned and left declaring that the city was built over Hell itself! He returned to Germany where he became a Bible teacher it was here in preparing for a lesson one day that he read Psalm 31:1 and later Romans 1:17 and realised by faith man can not only be deemed 'not guilty' but actually be seen as righteous before a perfect God.",

The death and ressurection of the Lord Jesus, the centre point of christianity, were factual events and these are the basis for our faith.  An ancient secular roman historian called Talus confirms the darkness that covered the earth following the death of the Lord Jesus, because he was alive at the time.  F.F. Bruce said that 'Anyone who propagates the idea that Jesus was a myth is neither a historian nor unbiased.' The distice features of the apostolic church were 1: the prescence of the foundational apostles 2:The unprecidented problems and victories of the church 3:The speed with which the Gospel spread 4:The transition of christianity from a branch of judaism to a seperate religion.",

He granted religious freedom to all faiths and became personally involved in church controversiessuch as the Arian controversy, which states that Jesus is not equal to God.  Because of Constantines influence christianity became a privileged religion and thus people became 'christian' for social and political gain, this lead to a great problem in the church.",

This influx on non-christians into christian circles led to 'true' christians seeking seperation from the church which led to the beginning of monasticism, but this in turn led to a false sense of spirituality, however there were some monastic movements that were very evangelistic. Another 'movement' that arose in the church at this time was the Roman Catholic church, this denomination came about when the bishop of Rome (which was the most powerful and influential city at the time) was declared by the emperor to have more spiritual authority than all other bishops.  Later in 590AD Pope Gregory I was not only the spiritual leader of Rome but also the political leader this came about when the Roman empire fell the pope stepped into the vacuum left. This was when the church of Rome began to gain more and more power.",

The concil voted 298 - 2 against Arius and Nicene creed was established, declaring Jesus to be God. In 450AD the council of Chalcedon was held to discuss the human nature of Jesus, this council determined correcvctly that Jesus was both fully God and fully man. Islam arose in the 7th century and within 100 years of Muhammad's death Islam streched across much of what was the roman empire, the christian empire had been split in 2 by this time with 2 centre, Rome and Constantinople, eventually Constantinople fell to Islam.

Their meetings were presided over by an elder or pastor who in turn was presided over by a local 'bishop', literally overseer, who would preside over all the church gatherings an example of a bishop would have been Titus who was told by Paul to appoint elders.  Again in this age of the church there was rapid church growth and the gosepl went as far as India Ethiopia and England.

The early church also believed what was written in the new testament writtings and around the year 220AD there arose a need, because of the arising heresies for a collection of writings that was to be authorative above all other christain writings, these writings were detrermined by three factors. 1: It had to have been written by an apostle or someone in direct contact with one of the apostles. 2: It had to have inherent character and worthiness that was in line with accepted scriptures. 3: I must have been widely recognised by the church at large.",

        "description": "This session deals with the effect of geography on church government and theology and some of the prominent people at the time; There were 4 prominent or 'Patriarchal' churches that arose in this era of history, these were the church of Rome, Antioch, Jerusalem and Alexandria, when ever a problem arose in a local church that church would seek council from one of these prominent churches.  Church theology was also influenced by geography for example the church at Alexandria was largely influenced by greek thinking. Some prominent figures were: Clement of Rome who believed in apostolic succession.  Hermas who wrote 'The Shepherd' which was a very popular book of the time.  Polycarp who was a disciple of the apostle John and fiercely confronted heretics, he was martyred.  Justin Martyr was an early apologist and of course was martyred.  Origen who actually mutilated his own body due to fanatacism, although he was a good man his method of interpretting scripture did a lot of damage.",

        "description": "There are two different types of reform, the first is prophetic reform which is forward looking where a man of God will arrive on the scene to proclaim a new era of God,s working with humanity, an example of this would be John the baptist.  The second type of reform is apostolic reform which is backward looking and looks at how the church used to be and then get back to that way of things, this was the type of reform that the Reformation was. Peter Waldo in France paid a priest to translate the latin Bible into french so he could read it easier, this revolutionised his life as he finally could understand what the Bible was saying, because of this though reading of the Bible was outlawed for all non-clergy. John Wycliffe in England taught at Oxford university and supported the king of England against the pope. He disagreed greatly with transubstantiation and believed the Bible to be the ultimate authority, for this reason he translated the Bible into english.",

He had disagreements with the church over not giving the cup of communion to the laity, he believed the Bible to be the hiehest authority and not the pope, he condemned the idols adorning churches and the selling of indulgences.  For these beliefs he was excommunicated and brought to Rome under the pretence that he woudl recieve a fair hearing, he didn't and was condemned to death and burnt at the stake. Desiderius Erasmus was a scholar who wanted to reform the church for moral and schollarly reasons, he lived around the same time as Luther and translated the new testament back into it's original language of greek.",

        "description": "Over the centuries a great schism grew between the ruling kings and power hungry popes, eventually it got the point where disgruntled kings set up their own pope who was excomunicated by the first but the new pope excomunicated the other pope in return, eventually everyone involved became sick of the fighting and set up a coucil to determine who was the true pope, but to no avail, the great schism showed up the political nature of the papacy. In 1492 King Ferdinand of Spain established the spanish inquisition, one of the first things the inquisition did was to expel all jews and muslims out of Spain thus meaning everyone left was 'christian' and therefore under their jurisdiction. The popes by now also reigned as emperors but were corrupt an immoral, more interested in political power and wealth than spirituality, an example of this was that people could pay to be made bishops and cardinals.  The 'church' at this time was so corrupt that something had to happen.",

John Calvin was a second generation reformer, he was schollarly and an excellent organiser, although he was french in origin Calvin pastored a church in Geneva which is still there today, the Geneva that Calvin lived in was amazing as the majority of people living there were born again christians. In 1564 at the Council of Trent the counter-reformation began it was an ecumenical council where the Roman Catholic church invited the portestants to attend, but they were'nt invited to debate doctrine but to repent for their abandoning the the church Church of Rome, the Council declared that that Church of Rome was infallible and that they were the only body who were allowed to interpret the BIble.",

He deals with misconceptions of praying only for leaders and not whole congregations, pointing out from Acts how the Holy Spirit fills both individuals and entire congregations.  Guzik appeals to let go of the 'machinery' of men to earnestly seek God in prayer for 'a unique stirring of the Spirit of God' in our day!",
