        "description": "Brother David shares a stirring message on the current persecution of the Church of Jesus Christ. He clearly shows from Scripture there will be a world-wide persecution of Christians in the end-times. That this world-wide persecution will be one of the great signs of the soon coming of the Lord Jesus Christ. He shares even for America that persecution is increasing and potentially coming very soon.",
