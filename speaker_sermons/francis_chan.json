        "description": "Francis Chan speaks on a very important subject of Church Unity and the sacredness of the Church. This message warns as the Scripture does: \"If anyone destroys God\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s temple, God will destroy that person; for God\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s temple is sacred.\" In the body of Christ in North America especially there is a great need to hear this message. To see God's people as holy and all of us as a body of Christ together and not to bite and devour one another as we are wounding Christ Himself who we share in.",

As we grow in our intimacy and maturity with Him, our lives should become increasingly radical. If we settle for comfort and safety, we won't grow in our dependence on Christ. He promises to be with us as we go out and make disciples\u2014facing the rejection, fear and self-doubt that come with reaching out beyond our capabilities.",
