        "description": "A marvelous testimony of God's power through a woman who had committed her life to her Saviour. From the 1930's to 1940's, the Lord led her to face WWII and communism in Northern China, where she saved over a 100 orphans. After China fell to the communists, the Lord led her to the islands of Hong Kong and Taiwan, where the love He put in her heart for the Chinese and lost children continued until her death in 1970. Through her stories, she encourages all believers to completely give their entire beings to God and see what He can do with such a life entrusted to Him.",
