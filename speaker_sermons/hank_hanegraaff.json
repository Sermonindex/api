        "description": "Christianity is undergoing a paradigm shift of major proportions \u2014 a shift from faith to feelings; from fact to fantasy; and from reason to esoteric revelation. Leaders of this Counterfeit Revival, such as Rodney Howard-Browne and John Arnott, have peppered their preaching and practice with fabrications, fantasies, and frauds, seemingly unaware of the profound consequences. John the Apostle warned, \"Dear friends, do not believe every spirit, but test the spirits to see whether they are from God, because many false prophets have gone out into the world\" (1 John 4:1). This warning is particularly relevant today, as Christianity is undergoing a paradigm shift of major proportions \u2014 a shift from faith to feelings; from fact to fantasy; and from reason to esoteric revelation. This paradigm shift is what I call the Counterfeit Revival.",
