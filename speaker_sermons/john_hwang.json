        "description": "A powerful exhortation by John Hwang on the great need for missions and the cause of Christ. The world is crying and dying for the need for a powerful proclamation of the Gospel of Jesus Christ. The baptism of the Spirit is essential for this work. He ends with a sober warning against idolatry in missions work and ministry. We must serve the Lord only for the Lord Himself, our ministry must never define us, our only identity is being a child of God.",
