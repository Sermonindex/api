This message is a call to pray for the gathering of believers in local areas that would be used in revival for God's work. He calls us to personal revival and then to go forward in God's work to a lost and dying world without Christ and the testimony of His bride.",

He shares that if we do not have a passionate love relationship with Jesus we will not stand during times of persecution.
