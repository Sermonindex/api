        "description": "Why are vast sums of money spent trying to retain converts and get them to grow? asks Mr Washer. Because we\u2019ve lost sight of the doctrines of salvation. This urgent message is a Biblical exposition of salvation and regeneration, which also defends both the honour of God and the unity of the true church. Men and women are going to hell for want of the preaching of this message, he says. It's no wonder, then, that he speaks with such passion.  (96 minutes)",

        "description": "The Apostle is here declaring the gospel to believers, not the lost; those who have already heard and received it. This shows that the gospel is not something learned in five minutes, after which we go on to \u2018deeper things\u2019. The gospel of Jesus Christ is the deepest and greatest truth in all scripture \u2013 and we still won\u2019t understand its greatness after an eternity of eternities. People are not excited about the gospel these days, because they don\u2019t know it, and they don\u2019t understand the fullness of it. Mr Washer pulls no punches: \u201cIf Jesus Christ and his gospel do not excite you, you are going to hell\u201d, he pleads, before going on to explain what he means. He argues the great need for preachers of the true gospel, and explains what it means to receive the gospel, and how we may know that we have received it. What is your motivation for coming to Jesus Christ? Security? Healing? A new Mercedes? Or do you come for salvation? But what about coming to Christ simply because he is worthy? That alone ought to be motivation enough to repent and believe. This potent and searching message ends with a sober warning of the perils of ignoring this gospel. (50 minutes)",

        "description": "Jesus said, \u201cI came not to send peace, but a sword\u201d  (Matt. 10:34), that sword being \u201cthe word of God\u201d (Eph. 6:17), which is \u201cquick, and powerful,\u2026\u2026piercing even to the dividing asunder of soul and spirit\u201d (Heb. 4:12). The closing words of  what some men choose to call \u2018The Sermon On The Mount\u2019 are a perfect example of this sword at work, dividing between strait and wide; narrow and broad; good trees and bad trees; good fruit and bad fruit; those that hear Jesus\u2019 words and do them, and those that hear Jesus\u2019 words and do them not; life and death; salvation and destruction; heaven and hell. As Mr Washer asserts, these are indeed fearful words, and he expounds them clearly and powerfully to the end that his hearers should be left in no doubt as to the eternal consequences of Jesus\u2019 teaching. How many preachers \u2018blunt\u2019 this sword in their attempts to make the message more \u2018acceptable\u2019 (as they think) to men; but Mr Washer cares too much for the souls he is addressing to compromise their eternal safety. If you\u2019re content to think that you\u2019re saved just because you \u2018asked Jesus into your heart\u2019 one time; and you don\u2019t want your faith to be tried and proved, whether it is actually of God or not; then don\u2019t bother listening to this message!  But I pray that you will listen to it, both for your own eternal safety, and for the pleasure and glory of God.   (68 minutes)",

Then, after exhorting fathers in the fulfilling of their Biblical responsibilities, he turns to Romans 12:1-2 where the apostle Paul urges us to give our lives away; not for a cause, but to a Person. Our motivation for doing so is \u2018the mercies of God\u2019, which Mr Washer then explains. This laying down of one\u2019s life is a once-and-for-all decision; but why does Paul say, Present your bodies? For one thing, it destroys the notion that a man can outwardly live in ungodliness whilst claiming that in his heart he really loves Jesus Christ. Furthermore, the things we do in our bodies are evidence of our sanctification and dedication to God. Mr Washer also examines in some detail what we put in to our bodies, revealing our responsibilities before God and men. He then considers in turn our eyes, ears, tongue, hands and feet, and how we clothe our bodies; he pleads with us to do all things to the glory of God.  (46 minutes).",

        "description": "Part 2 opens with one more example of presenting our bodies a living sacrifice: the dangers of dating. This is so rarely taught that something has to be said from a Biblical basis. Parents are not teaching their children their responsibilities, and the church is not showing the parents how. Biblical counsel is this: don\u2019t put yourself in the way of temptation. This issue is not a question of the intellect, it\u2019s a question of the will: we know what\u2019s right, we just don\u2019t want to do it. Proceeding into v.2,  Mr Washer explains what it means to be not conformed to this world, both for individuals and for the church. He explains that the renewing of the mind is a total transformation, a supernatural creative work of God. He then examines the will of God, and how you will know it by its characteristics of being good, acceptable and perfect. This message outlines practical issues that we all have to deal with. Believing the doctrine is one thing; but is it a growing, practical reality in your life? If not, stop and deal with it, one step at a time.  (43 minutes)",

        "description": "At the time of writing there have been only 371 downloads of this message, which is a great pity considering its content. Paul Washer is giving a presentation of the work of the HeartCry Missionary Society, and his message is an encouragement to believe that God is at work in the world and His gospel is indeed the power of God unto salvation. HeartCry owes its continuity and growth since 1988, not to the great faith of men, but to the great faithfulness of God. \u201cGod delights in vindicating the confidence of his children\u201d, Mr Washer asserts, and the more we cut ourselves off from the arm of the flesh, the more we will see of the arm of God. Why does HeartCry prefer to work with indigenous (locally born) missionaries? Why is theological training so vital? Why is it important to establish autonomous local churches? The answers to these and many more question are in this message. If nothing else, listen to it for the moving account of how God provided Christian books for a small church in the jungles of Peru, and believe Mr Washer when he says, \u201cGod moves nations for you!  Don't you just love a God like that?\u201d.  (58  minutes)",

He then considers the men who first received this commission, and the necessity of their transformation at Pentecost. Our attention is then drawn to the Christ of the Great Commission, especially his unlimited, unhindered, unending authority over all (v.18). Jesus referred to himself as the Son of Man many times, to show us who he really was, the fulfilment of Daniel\u2019s vision (Dan.7:13,14). There is only one true King and kingdom in the world today; lose sight of his sovereignty, and you lose the hope of missions. Finally Mr. Washer examines the commission itself - its foundation, commands, and effects - and asks whether our own lives and ministries are worthy of being exported to nations that have already been ravaged and confused by our false doctrines, false gospels, false evangelists, carnality and worldliness. He ends with a passionate plea for missions and missionaries, and an exhortation to confidence in the One who said, \u201cLo, I am with you alway\u201d (v.20). That\u2019s not a promise, he says, it\u2019s a FACT.  (79 minutes).",

Paul Washer begins his exhortations by dealing with the speculations (AV = \u2018imaginations\u2019) which must be cast down if we are to fulfil our calling to be a biblical people. He focuses on the roles of men in particular, both in their families and their local churches, which he shows to be the two hardest places to live out a Biblical manhood. Most problems in those two areas, he says, can be traced back to men not standing on truth and not acting Biblically. Working through specific examples, he shows how the speculations of men actually fight against God, and also shows how such things should be put right. He then focuses in some detail on marriage, using Romans 8:28. Once a man discovers the true purpose of marriage, and learns what it means to love his wife as Christ loves the church, he will find both joy and rest in putting an end to his former speculations about the nature of marriage.

        "description": "Paul Washer now expounds the third and fourth Biblical tests by which we can be assured that the faith we profess is genuine, and that we have truly believed unto salvation: they concern keeping God\u2019s commandments, and walking as Christ walked. Whilst explaining these in detail, he also shows that he is advocating neither salvation by works nor legality. Rather, these tests concern fruit-bearing. The manner of our life (ie, the fruit) evidences whether God has truly saved us or not. (34 minutes)",

These are: not loving the world; persevering in the faith; embracing the fullness of Christ\u2019s person; the practice of righteousness; and trust in the sole sufficiency of Christ. From various verses in 1st John, Mr Washer clearly explains each issue, and ends with a personal testimony from his own family life. (57 minutes)",

        "description": "Paul Washer begins this exposition of Matthew 5:5 by explaining that \u2018The Beatitudes\u2019 (verses 3-11) do not just speak of what it is to live a blessed life, but they speak of conformity to the image of Christ, for they are a great description of Jesus Christ as he walked on this earth. Many preachers say little more about meekness than showing that is not weakness; but what does the word really mean? The true meaning of any word is defined not merely through a dictionary, but by studying the context of the passage(s) where it occurs; so, using the obvious parallels between Matthew 5:5 and Psalm 37:11, Mr Washer uses the context of Psalm 37:1-11 to define the word \u2018meek\u2019. He works through the verses one by one, revealing the character of the meek man: he does not fret, nor envy the wicked; he trusts in God and dwells in the land; he delights himself in the Lord, commits his way unto the Lord, rests in the Lord, and so on. \u201cThis is what it means to be meek\u201d, says Mr Washer, \u201cand it is one of our greatest needs today\u201d.

Ingrid played excerpts of a message by Paul Washer that was preached to 5,000 young people at a Southern Baptist conference. Ingrid pointed out that the message was not well received. Why is that? Today, Christian youth are exposed to many entertainment based Bible messages. This is in direct contrast to Reverend Washer's message. He communicated that far too many people believe that even though they love so many things in the world, they're saved because at some point in their life they prayed a prayer and supposedly \"accepted\" Christ into their life. Reverend Washer debunks this notion of split allegiance. He explains how we need to learn how to love the things that God loves and hate the things that God hates, recognizing that the only reason we are saved, if in fact we are, is because Jesus, on the Cross, took upon himself the wrath of the Father; wrath that would otherwise have fallen on us.",

Firstly, Christians believe the Bible even if they cannot explain what the Bible says; they do not alter the texts they cannot explain. Secondly, Christians can testify of times of prayer when the presence and power of God fill the heart almost to bursting; it is not so with the Jehovah\u2019s Witness, for God is not with them. Thirdly, check whether the Jehovah\u2019s Witness\u2019 \u201cgospel\u201d conforms to the Gospel that the Apostle Paul preached, using the above scriptures.",

They would rather stand out in the midst of a depraved humanity, and cry out thus saith the Lord, hear the Word of the Lord.

        "description": "This message, based on Matthew 28:16-18, is a word of comfort, encouragement and exhortation both to missionaries and to all believers. Firstly, Paul Washer explains how the disciples must have felt as Jesus came to them after his resurrection: weak, doubting, and so aware that all their claims to devotion had failed. Yet how patient God is, and Mr Washer expounds the blessed promises concerning the smoking flax and bruised reed. He then says that much of today\u2019s preaching takes away from the glory of Christ, because it puts into the future what the New Testament declares is now. Christ said, All power is (now) given unto me. Turning to Psalm 2, Mr.Washer shows how and why the heathen rage against the gospel of Jesus Christ; but God mocks them, for he has established his King, and all authority is given to Him. We should not fear those who oppose the gospel, not should we be angry; we should pity them \u2013 and Mr Washer shares his own experience when arrested by police in Peru. He then expounds \u2018the Son of Man\u2019 (Daniel 7:13) in the context of Christ\u2019s kingdom. Conspiracy theories? There are no such thing! says Mr Washer; man can do NOTHING unless Jesus Christ decrees it. Jesus Christ is king, NOW!  71 minutes.",

        "description": "The word holy at it's very core means 'cut' or seperate, God is so far beyond what we think He is like that we cannot truelly concieve of how what He truelly is.  In christianity today we have such a small God that bares little resemblence to the high and lofty One that inhabits eternity.  The Lord said to Moses 'I am that I am' meaning that there is no-one like Him, unlike us when He looks about He see's none like Him, except for a Carpenter who walked the earth 2000 Years ago.  The essence of seperation (holiness) is not what we are seperated from but what or in this case Who, we are seperated to.  There is no point seperating ourselves from the world if we don't then seperate ourselves unto God.",

As Jeremiah says, it is \u201cThus saith THE LORD\u201d - not men - regarding what is essential in life; and what is essential is to know and to understand God. It is what we were created for. This is not a question of holding sound doctrine and orthodox truth. I want more than truth, he pleads; I want the REALITY of those truths in my life; deeply rooted, and springing forth into fruit unto the glory of God. This issue is not about doctrine, it is about the person of God; and in order to grow in sanctification, in zeal, in heart-felt emotion and love, we MUST have this personal knowledge of God; it is the source and motivation for all these things. The purpose of all truth is to bring us to the feet of Christ; and from there to the feet of everyone else, as servants; our boasting will then be not in what we know, but rather in what God is.

But whilst casting down false strongholds, he is also faithful to build up that which is true, clearly setting out what is the TRUE gospel of Christ, of which the Apostle was not ashamed. When that gospel is preached, we should be asking men, not \u201cDo you know you\u2019re a sinner?\u201d but \u201cHas God so worked in your heart that the sin you once loved you now hate?\u201d; not \u201cHave you made a decision?\u201d but \u201cHas God worked in your heart?\u201d; not \u201cDo you want to go to heaven?\u201d but \u201dHas God so worked in your heart that you now esteem him worthy above all things, and desire HIM?\u201d. Mr Washer includes examples of some Godly conversions, which clearly bear the fruits of  that miraculous and supernatural repentance and regeneration which are the work of God alone. (50 minutes).",

        "description": "Paul Washer sets out to answer the question of where his passion comes from, and in so doing he traces a path to the holiness and extra-ordinary majesty of God as seen by Isaiah. He reveals his own love for Godly men of old, who thought great thoughts about God, and whose writings have been influential in his own life. Reading from some of their writings, as well as his own notes, he explains something of what Isaiah saw. The Apostle John shows that Isaiah saw a revelation of the Son (thereby proving his eternal deity), yet Isaiah saw only an image, reduced to what his finite capacity could receive. Holiness is so much more than we think; holiness is the highest statement which could ever be made in regard to God; it speaks of separateness and uniqueness. And what is the effect of its revelation? We are faced with our own uncleanness and nothingness in the presence of a holy God; yet at the same time a Saviour is revealed to us in his condescending love. Let all flesh be abased, that God\u2019s glory may be the more elevated. (73 minutes)",

        "description": "Paul Washer sometimes expounds a number of different (but often related) topics in his sermons, and this message is no exception. Preaching in Denmark, he opens with a plea for men who have a zeal for the Lord\u2019s house, who will stand up and be counted, and will seize the opportunities for preaching the gospel while they exist. Moving on to Chapter 1 of Mark\u2019s gospel, he shows how demanding life can be for the zealous man of God, as exemplified in the ministry of Jesus Christ himself. If the Son of God could not live on earth without prayer and secret communion with his Father, how much less can we. He was never too busy to pray; nor should we be. Everything we are in public, is formed by what we are in private when we are alone with God, says Mr Washer; and he then goes on to use the Luke 18 passage to expound the topic of persevering prayer, showing both how and why we should endure in prayer, how God delights in it, and what it can achieve.

Few people know, with real, unshakeable certainty, that everything is working together for good. If you don\u2019t believe it, you probably have the wrong definition of good. Are you discontented? Are you shaken by adversities, or the removal of blessings and comforts? Mr Washer uses these verses to reveal the causes and the remedy. God has made us sons and daughters, a high calling indeed; yet whilst we certainly benefit, the prime beneficiary is God\u2019s son. God is making brothers and sisters for his son, a fellowship of those who stand in awe of their elder brother and worship him; and we can only worship him truly if we are conformed to his image. We have to be made like him to know how worthy he is; and the more we know him, the more we will be drawn to worship him. Is God\u2019s ultimate purpose your purpose? Is your eye single in this respect? If not, Mr Washer explains what you should do.  (29 minutes)",

He played a clip demonstrating the passion this preacher preached with. The clip convicted me tremendously, but I also couldn\u2019t help but think of those in the past who have called me \u201ctoo intense\u201d and \u201cradical.\u201d Is there a sense that many of those who call on the name of Jesus have no idea what true commitment to following Christ entrails? Is seeking \u201cYour Best Life Now,\u201d expanding your territory, or hunting your \u201cPurpose Driven Life\u201d really what it is all about? When Jesus said to cut off your hand or poke out your eye, or to take up your cross and follow Him, was he being \u201ctoo intense\u201d and \u201cradical?\u201d I don\u2019t think Paul Washer believes so, neither do I. If you have 3 minutes, listen to this! This is Paul Washer speaking at a youth rally. Is this too intense and radical, or is it someone who believes the Lord at His words?",
