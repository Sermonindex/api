I found him to be this Mr. E, of whom I have been speaking. The Spirit of the Lord had so powerfully convicted him, that he was unable to sit on his seat.

The children of disobedience are lost and have a different spirit than the saved.

(Matthew 1:21) There is a change of heart that accompanies the genuine born again experience in which sin is no longer viewed as a means to gratification or happiness. Sin is seen as the means of death that is the source of all evil, pain, and suffering. Unrepentant sinners are proficient in sin through their own vain imaginations coupled with the various inventions of others. In contrast, the born again understand that they cannot be saved from hell until they are first saved from sin. Sin is not their friend. Satan is not their friend. The world is not their friend. They realize that sin is forgiven when it is repented of and not while persisted in. The purpose of God in saving man was not to abolish the law and allow man to sin with impunity; that would be antinomianism (lawlessness). The purpose was to establish the absolute Lordship of Jesus Christ as we walk in the Spirit in harmony with the personality of God.",
