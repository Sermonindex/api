The enemy will come at believers, but when we remember the truth and point him to Jesus, he will lose every time. Mordecai bowed not before Haman, but the rest of the King's servants did. There was no discernment that this was an enemy. Mordecai did not try to hide who or what he was. We are called to declare our testimony of the Lord, given to us when he saved us. Mordecai had witnessed some of the king's servant's turn against him, and plot to kill him, he'd seen evil. So he recognized it. We do not have to bow before our enemy or yield.",

They wanted to have a man to fight their battles, someone they could see, like the world around them had, to go before them, rather than the undefeatable, Almighty God fighting for them. They didn't want to forsake their own ideals and let God be Lord of their life. Saul was representative of this rebellion and illustrates the danger of this kind of stronghold.",

Our willingess to follow him in this, to follow our Master and lay down our life for his purposes is a life lived sacrificially. The pit creates a longing to shed the selfish and proud life in us and want more of God. This is a message about taking up our cross.",

Unless something dies it will never know the resurrection power of Jesus. This is good instruction on our cross, serving others, as the Master did. Following Jesus will lead us to a place our flesh will not want to go, but we must endure the fire and die to self to get to the victory of seeing others reached through a yielded life. Jesus gave the perfect example of a vessel yielded totally to God and how many were reached and saved. He is our pattern, church. Not men.",
