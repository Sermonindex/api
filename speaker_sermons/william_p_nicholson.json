        "description": "Nicholson teaches us that if you are born again and saved you will know it. This is our assurance that we know that we are saved by the spirit of God and a changed life. This message really gives a clear message of what it is to be born-again he cuts no corners and shows the extreme importance of knowing of a surety about our eternal future. The main points of the sermon are taken from an sermon by the late Horatious Bonar.",
