            "description": "Bro. Wilkerson explains how you become a part of the family of God when you are born again and all the rights and inheritance you obtain as a child of God. He contrasts the vast difference in the inheritance the devil's family has waiting and the Lord's family. \u00a0God's people desperately need to know of a surety their position in Christ. This will defeat much of the work of the enemy in trying to hinder your walk with God. A must hear for every Christian.",
