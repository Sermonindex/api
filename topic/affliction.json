In the times of great abundance, Pharaoh\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s dream instructs us to be wise to store up, whether physically or spiritually with our free time to study God's Word.  The naming of Joseph's two sons illustrates that before we can be fruitful, we must forget all the evil and mistakes of others.",

            "description": "God is calling us to drink the CUP of JESUS in its entirety. Many of us come to Christ and we want to drink from the cup of salvation, future authority, present power and healing but we don\u2019t want to go the distance and drink the cup of suffering and affliction. If we are going to put the cup to our mouth we must come to the place where we cry like Jesus \"NOT MY WILL BUT THINE BE DONE\". This is a place where the only strength we have is to lift up the cup and call on the name of Jesus. In these times of darkness don't cast away your confidence in God because there is a great reward for those who drink this cup in faith and trust.",
