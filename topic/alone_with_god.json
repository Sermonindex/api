When I was a beginner in the ministry, before I came to Brooklyn, I used to try to get a week now, or two weeks then, to wait upon the Lord.  And one time, I found out that a brother-in-law of mine and his family were going away on a vacation, and so I asked him whether I couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be in his house for those two weeks.  So he allowed me to if I would take care of his chickens.  Well, they were all dead by the time he came back two week later.  And his little girl said to me, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153You died them, didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t you?\u00e2\u20ac\u009d  Well, no.  They died by themselves.  I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have to do anything about it.",
