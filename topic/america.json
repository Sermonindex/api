The Church has sinned, we have sinned, not living and \"doing\" the word of God.  American true Christians are officially classified with extremists in the class of terrorists by the FBI and Homeland Security in the USA. True Christians love their enemies and do good yet we are starting to be hated. Jesus said this would happen. America and Canada are killing the unborn on an altar of lust. It is the greatest genocide in human history.",

His appeal and influence transcended denominational lines, and he spoke to many different groups of people.\r\n\r\nThroughout his ministry, Vance Havner lived and preached that a Christian should should exhibit faithfulness to Jesus in all areas of life.  He taught that the Christian should attend to, \"the outliving of the inliving Christ.\"  Havner wrote, \"To some, Christianity is an argument.  To many, it is a performance.
