            "description": "When somebody is searching for a church today, they usually ask the following questions to the church secretary or Pastor: Do you have a youth program? How many ball fields do you have? Do you have a fitness center and does it have basketball courts? Do you have a contemporary music program at your church and a good worship band? Do you have recovery groups for the divorced and drug-dependent? Do you have yoga classes? Do you have Zumba dance classes? In other words, a typical American family looking for a typical American church today approaches it like they do a buffet line in a restaurant with a smorgasbord of choices. In essence, they are saying, \u201cBefore I join your church let me see a menu and look over it to see if you can service my family the way I want you to.\u201d",

It will either be a defending or avenging to show forth His glory and remind mankind He alone is the Sovereign ruler of all.\"",
