Shane Idleman is the founder and lead pastor of Westside Christian Fellowship, in Lancaster, Ca. His sermons, books, articles, and radio program have sparked change in the lives of many.

Shane, however, believes that we can, and offers his books as contributions to that commitment.\r\nShane\u2019s ministry has sparked change in the lives of many. He\u2019s calling families, marriages, and the country back to the biblical principles that once made America prized among nations. His bold stance has led to speaking engagements at some of the largest churches in the nation.",
