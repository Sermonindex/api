The history of the early Anabaptist is one rich and alive with the personal testimonies of men and women who found the living God. The deaths that so many of them suffered for Christ brought life all over Europe. God and His principles have not changed. Life in our lives and communities will come in the same way.",

            "description": "A personal relationship with Jesus, fellowship, accountability, evangelism, and the two kingdoms are a few of the foundations of the Anabaptist faith and practice. Jesus Christ was the chief cornerstone of all of their lives. They lived their lives by His example. Their evangelism, fellowship, and other doctrines flowed out of a life given totally to Christ. This is a very needed message for us as their descendants to practice today.",

It was either everything for the Lord or nothing at all. Baptism for them meant very possible death any day forward from then. What does complete surrender mean for you today? Should it be any less radical?",

This message is a challenge to set our sights on everything Jesus bought and paid for, in the shedding of His blood. Will we return to the \"all or nothing\" mentality, making a clear commitment to evangelism, Christ, and persecution as did they? The combination of these is what kept their lives alive!!",

About 75% of the people will answer yes without hesitation. What are we doing to prepare our children for this persecution? Are we ready to face it? The Bible is clear that our enemy, Satan, will make war against us and try to wear out the saints. This message brings in scriptures that make this clear. This message also gives some clear direction for preparation that we can do, so that we are ready to stand.",
