            "description": "For all its symbolism, the book of Revelation is above all else a story: the final scenes of an age-old battle between the Kingdom of God and the kingdom of darkness. Satan began his assault on God\u2019s Kingdom in heaven, but then took his attack into a new level in the Garden. All that mankind lost when we said \u201cyes\u201d to the devil there, will be restored at the end of the age. This fascinating book describes the Messiah\u2019s final triumph over evil.",

When Jesus looked at the fledgling congregation meeting in Philadelphia, He didn\u2019t see the lack of \u201csuccess\u201d that worldly-minded Christians would see; He saw a group of believers who would faithfully follow Him no matter what they encountered. The last of the seven churches Jesus would address was the nauseating, self-satisfied congregation of Laodicea. Their prosperity deluded them into believing they were godly Christians, when actually they were spiritually impoverished.",
