God will either pour out His blessings in revival to defend His holy Name, or He will pour out His wrath upon mankind to avenge His holy Name. It will either be a defending or avenging to show forth His glory and remind mankind He alone is the Sovereign ruler of all.\"",

Circumcise yourselves to the LORD, and take away the foreskins of your hearts because your doings are evil. The Church is heading in the wrong direction. The wills of those within it are revolting against God. Do not be deceived by outward professions! Those who bear the good fruit of holy living are the true Church of Jesus Christ. Many religious leaders have risen up and prophesied falsely, but the people love to have it so. These false shepherds cannot be trusted. Repent! Be deceived no longer! What will you do in the end?",

These are they who are crying out to God, who still hunger and thirst after righteousness, inspite of the apostasy in the mainstream church, and a sin-sick world, there are those who still hunger for God. This is a sobering message reflective of today's society, but ends in a joyous certainty of the victory and provision of our Lord for his people.",
