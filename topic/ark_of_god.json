For over 70 years, the church was blessed and challenged by the prophetic ministry of Vance Havner. His style and burden was prophetic similar to the ministry of A.W. Tozer calling the Church to revival. His influence extended to a national level, but Dr. Havner's approach was always to minister where God directed, regardless of the size of the church.  His appeal and influence transcended denominational lines, and he spoke to many different groups of people.\r\n\r\nThroughout his ministry, Vance Havner lived and preached that a Christian should should exhibit faithfulness to Jesus in all areas of life.  He taught that the Christian should attend to, \"the outliving of the inliving Christ.\"  Havner wrote, \"To some, Christianity is an argument.  To many, it is a performance.  To a few, it is an experience.\"",

He was radically converted by reading the New Testament. God used him to have a powerful prophetic insight into the end-times and the coming suffering of the jewish people before the great accepting of Jesus as Messiah. His eschatological insight is a very needful truth to be realized in the body of Christ. \r\n\r\nArt was a prophetic voice insofar as he called his listeners to purposes in God that would affect both time and eternity, purposes that had to do with the glory of God in the Church.   Frequently, his messages called the Church to an awareness of the Last Days [End-times] in such a way that made that time seem imminent and at the door.",

Secondly, he discusses man's dealing with holy things of God, namely the ark of God. The application he preaches on is how we try to dress the gospel up to modernize it. He points out that the man who tried to steady the ark was not blaspheming God, he was not smashing it, or in any way intentionally rebelling against the Lord; but for all this, he was still disobediant and killed on the spot. \"A lady called me from the border of Mexico today...she was weeping, she said, '...oh, we do want to be such great soulwinners'...I said to her, my dear look, the first commandment is not, \"thou shalt be a soulwinner,\" the first commandment is, \"thou shalt love the Lord thy God...\"",
