            "description": "One of the things you do not find in the Book of Acts is the reliance on church buildings. Yet in almost every Christian circle and denomination, there is an emphasis upon building the church, not that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153the body of Christ may be built up\u00e2\u20ac\u009d112 but rather the building of an actual structure that we refer to commonly as the church. There is a great benefit at times in having a building where the Lord\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s people can meet in and use for the ministry of the Gospel. Yet, when we look at the Book of Acts, we find no visible record that the Church built buildings. Though they met in some physical locations such as Solomon\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Colonnade113 and the hall of Tyrannus for even two years!114 Yet, this was not the common practice of how saints met across the rest of God\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Churches. Even when looking carefully in Church history it is hard to find evidence of a building being used until 300 AD when pagan temples were being converted into churches under the reign of Constantine.",

If it was important to have specific church buildings to represent God and spread the Gospel, would God not have commanded them in Scripture?

As the prophet says: \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcHeaven is My throne, and the earth is My footstool. What kind of house will you build for Me? Says the Lord. Or where will My resting place be?

Sadly modern Christendom has been overwhelmed with the salesman who sells Christ as ware and treats the holy things as a way to profit financially.150 It does not take much discernment for the worldly person to see the counterfeit preacher on TV who makes money look like their god.151 Yet, sadly, believers who are asleep spiritually, and have not been seeking the Lord, are given over to this delusion which is coming upon them in masses.152 False teachers abound and the saints are sleeping. There needs to be a clarion cry across all nations that God is not for sale and is against those who love money and equate righteousness with financial gain and profit.",

If a believer is not overcoming 100% in a specific area, or is partaking in some worldly activity, one may judge and claim that believer is not saved. Such merely outward judging is not spiritual but an immature and dangerous thing to do. Of course, if a believer is blatantly continuing in outward sin he must be dealt with in gentleness and love. As God taught us through the Book of Acts and Epistles of Paul, corrective measures as determined by the Holy Spirit might be necessary. This may include asking a believer to leave the Assembly for a period of time.",

Their cry to go and make new disciples is backed up with their very lives. In many cases if they speak to the wrong person about Jesus, they face prison, torture and even death. The task of sharing the Gospel is for every Christian, even if they give their life as a martyr. Chinese Christians teach us that when their seed (their life) has gone into the ground and died it will multiply and produce much more fruit.544 With their blood new growth is coming. The seed, their body that died now produces 100 fold, 1000 fold or even more.",

For many there is a hesitancy to speak much of depending radically on the moving of the Holy Spirit.

The Devil our enemy always makes a pseudo571 of the genuine in attempts to deceive572 some and deter others. Some in these charismatic circles claim the Chinese Church is experiencing the same manifestations, but this is not true.",

The adults were told by those who had captured them: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153If you do not acknowledge our Dear leader as god and if you do not renounce Christ, your children will be hanged.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d One of the children looked up at her mother. What would she do? Earlier that morning, twenty-eight other Christians had been bound and taken before a screaming crowd of North Koreans. The guards made it clear: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153If you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t deny your Christ you will die.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d The mother thought of her child but she could not deny her Lord. The other Christians quietly made the same decision. Their God was real.",

Recently, we heard of a pastor of a church in America who felt led of the Lord to appoint 12 pastors in his Church who would oversee 12 separate home Churches on Wednesday nights. They all still meet together on Sunday mornings to hear the main pastor teach, but these small groups also act as functioning Churches. These pastors of the small groups are perhaps not as well-trained or capable from a human perspective but this servant leader saw the heart of God to raise up brothers and sisters, to encourage and lead the body of Christ.",

The Islamic Republic and its leaders, operate under a great desire for Islamic world dominion with a religious fervor that does not permit faiths other than Islam.",

The regime argued that his Christian activities were equivalent to actions against national security. Pastor Fathi is presently serving a 6-year sentence in Iran\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s notorious Evin prison. His crime is being a Christian and freely exercising his faith.

This is very much like the account of the Book of Acts where it says the Church was: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Praising God and enjoying the favor of all the people. And the Lord added to their number daily those who were being saved.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d771 In some cases, when they have meetings where there are no stories of a conversion they examine what they have done wrong to hinder the Lord working. Such growth has happened in the last 30 years to where many say conservative estimates put the size of the Iranian house Churches at over one million people.",

Something in us does not want to accept the idea that in the end times all nations will hate and persecute Christians. This seems like a non-reality to us and something that could never happen because we live in such religiously tolerant countries such as Canada, United Kingdom and United States. We would like to edit our Lord\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Words and abbreviate them with a softer less harsh reality. Yet, this will not change the truth our Lord said would happen.",

He has been building a pure pristine Book of Acts fellowship in House Church networks all over rural China. There is a simplicity to the move of God yet such fervency, love, and desire born in the hearts of these believers. We need to break out of the simple 1 hour church meeting patterns, and start to serve the Lord with full commitment like many of these precious brothers and sisters in the Lord. For many of us the questions and truths that are revealed are very important for us to hear as we gather under the Headship of Jesus Christ in local areas.",

This was a surprise and great blessing for before we were never aware of this underground house Church name. After reading their statement of faith, there was an immediate burden to make this statement of faith available to Gospel Fellowships and to any other house Churches or groups that would like to identify with the statement. We believe it is a tremendous way for believers to be in unity worldwide with precious brothers and sisters in China who are experiencing a great expansion of the Church and revival.",

In this case we are encouraging a chronological reading of the Scriptures. Most of the confusion is created when certain teachers, groups, or denominations take singular verses out of context and compare them with others. Though it is a good spiritual principle to compare spiritual truths with spiritual truths,1139 yet this must all be done in the larger context of God\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Word.

Any 2-3 brothers or sisters can meet in this way and start to allow the Lord to mature their gathering. We must have the simplicity of faith that our Gathering is unto Him and not for ourselves. Early Christians met together with a great joy at times because they were gathering with others who have been redeemed by the precious blood of Jesus Christ. So Jesus Christ Himself was the center of their unity. These simple guidelines combine many of the Principles found in the Principles for the Gathering of Believers volume.",

Many hymns and choruses that could be sung by memory and without instruments have been laid aside for more contemporary songs that have much musical accompaniment. The argument is not over styles of music or what is permissible in a worship setting but rather that a very powerful weapon of the Church has been lost. This occurs when we do not have many hymns and choruses that we can sing without instruments with a whole heart towards the Lord. Thus the burden here is to simply supply a resource of many old hymns, choruses and spiritual songs for reading, meditation and singing privately and corporately.",

Look the lost in the face and take hold of them lovingly by the hand and say, \u2018My friend, you are dying, you are going to everlasting death If nobody has ever told you till now - I have come to tell you \u2019.",

Under all the cultivations of heaven, they brought forth bitter and poisonous fruit; as in the two verses next preceding the text. The expression I have chosen for my text, Their foot shall slide in due time, seems to imply the following doings, relating to the punishment and destruction to which these wicked Israelites were exposed.",

They are indeed free in respect of men, who cannot judge us for them, but God can and will. Many people who seem to be modest and sparing as to evil words and deeds will still make bold with thoughts and, as the saying is, pay it with thinking. Such are speculative, contemplative sinners.",

He joined the Free Church in 1843, and was its moderator in 1878. He was identified with evangelical and revival movements and adhered to the doctrine of premillennialism. With Robert Murray McCheyne he visited Palestine in 1839 to inquire into the condition of the Jews there. During the visit of Dwight L. Moody to Britain in 1874 and 1875, Moody was warmly welcomed by Bonar, despite the latter receiving considerable criticism from other Calvinist ministers in the Free Church.",

            "description": "Read by Howard Douglas King. Edward Payson was an outstanding American preacher of the early Nineteeth Century. From 1807 to 1827, laboring in the pulpit of Second Church in Portland, Maine, he saw extraordinary success in the conversion and edification of souls. He was held in such esteem, that thousands named their sons after him, and prayed that they would grow up to be like him. He preached the same biblical Calvinism that the Puritans preached before him. His written sermons are remarkably easy to read, even today. They are characterized by great vividness and convicting power, and by a captivating eloquence. This sermon is an excellent example of Puritan evangelism. Payson's goal is to convince the sinner that his salvation does not lie -- as he assumes -- within his own power. Armed with a deep knowledge of the deceitful heart of man, he drives the sinner from his refuge of lies, leaving him painfully aware of his ruined and helpless state, knowing that his only hope is in the mercy of a Sovereign God.",
