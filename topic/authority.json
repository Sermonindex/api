It starts with Romans 13 and moves through many Scriptures dealing with authority, submission, and obedience. Kaung shows that only God deserves complete obedience and that he must be obeyed at all costs. The main message of the sermon can be summed up in this quote from the message: \"God is the only authority in the Universe.  There is no authority whatsoever except God himself -- and what God has given. \u2026  There is so much misunderstanding about authority; we mistake something that\u2019s commonly accepted as authorities (sic) without really knowing what authority really is. \u2026 God is the one and only authority. Any professed authority that is not from God -- that is not God himself -- is not real authority, because God is the only authority in the whole universe. \u2026 The more you give, the more authority you have.  The Lord Jesus said, \u2018I gave myself a ransom for many.\u2019 Because he gave himself as a ransom for many, the many come under his authority. If you want to be the first among your brothers and sisters, then you have to be a bond-slave, not only to Christ, but to your brothers and sisters.\u201d",

Firstly, Paul Washer explains how the disciples must have felt as Jesus came to them after his resurrection: weak, doubting, and so aware that all their claims to devotion had failed. Yet how patient God is, and Mr Washer expounds the blessed promises concerning the smoking flax and bruised reed. He then says that much of today\u2019s preaching takes away from the glory of Christ, because it puts into the future what the New Testament declares is now. Christ said, All power is (now) given unto me. Turning to Psalm 2, Mr.Washer shows how and why the heathen rage against the gospel of Jesus Christ; but God mocks them, for he has established his King, and all authority is given to Him. We should not fear those who oppose the gospel, not should we be angry; we should pity them \u2013 and Mr Washer shares his own experience when arrested by police in Peru. He then expounds \u2018the Son of Man\u2019 (Daniel 7:13) in the context of Christ\u2019s kingdom. Conspiracy theories? There are no such thing! says Mr Washer; man can do NOTHING unless Jesus Christ decrees it. Jesus Christ is king, NOW!  71 minutes.",

It has now sold over 10 million copies in thirty-five languages. After the fall of communism in Europe, Brother Andrew shifted his focus to the Middle East and has worked to strengthen the church in the Islamic world.
