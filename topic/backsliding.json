            "description": "It is said that of those that make a decision for Christ, over 90% backslide. It is shocking. Billy Graham once said that in the beginning people came with tears because of their sins, but lately they come with smiles. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no true repentance. An evil spirit doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t find rest in the wilderness and then he decides to go back to the one he has left and see how it goes. Then he finds the house put in order and neat and he goes and finds seven others which he met in the wilderness, worse than himself, and they go and inhabit that person. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a dangerous thing to say you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve made a decision for Christ but you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t go all the way but only do it half-heartedly. The devil doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t like it in the wilderness. He wants to stay in a nice place, even in those made in God\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s image.",

            "description": "March 2, 2008 - The church that loses its calling begins to drift away from a Christ ceneterd focus to a man focus. This man focus will lead us into a false sense of identity and there will be a great inability to hear and receive challenging and deepening truths. This church becomes \"doctrinal shoppers\" who shop around until they find a voice that does not confront their errors. This church loses the heart for the poor and desires to satisfy self. The church of Christ is not called to be like men. We are called to look beyond self and to focus on Christ so we can be conformed to His image.",
