Zac Poonen concentrates on six areas where we need to be balanced, the first two expounded in this sermon: 1) faith and works, and 2) love for God and love for man.",

He lists many tangents that need to be avoided. Although we must \"not be nibblers of the possible but grabbers of the possible\" this needs to be held in balance with common sense. There are many tensions that need to be maintained between seeming opposites in the journey to being more Christ-like.",
