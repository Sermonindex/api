            "description": "This is a marvelous word! This is God Himself speaking to people who continually trouble Him. They've broken their covenant with God time and again. They turned aside from God Who brought them out of Egypt with an outstretched hand and great power. Time after time they would repent, often half-heartedly, but then fall back worse than before. God refers here to \"the names of Baalim\" in their mouth - serving many Baals. You might serve many things, money, honour or pleasure. God says that He will make a covenant with them and the beasts of the field. What does He mean by this expression? There's a reference in the Bible that \"you may not muzzle the ox who treads the corn\", and it is applied in the New Testament to refer to those who sow the Gospel. So too these animals are a symbol of people.",
