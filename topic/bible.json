            "description": "Romans says that men are without excuse because God's invisible attributes are seen through his creation.  Ken Ham establishes the necessity for Christians to stand for a six day creation account, and not to succumb to the ways of the world and adopt the \"millions of years\" thesis.  When one does that, he shows that God is no longer a God of love, but rather a cruel, heartless and capricious God.  If one interprets anything in Genesis 1-11 to be allegory, then the very underpinnings of the gospel narrative are also fractured.  One cannot believe that the fall of Adam was allegorical and also believe that the Last Adam took all of an \"allegorical Adam's\" sin upon himself.  This is a very well presented, well thought out, and reasonable argument to establish the importance of a literal creation account.",
