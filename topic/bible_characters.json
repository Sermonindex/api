You will discover how a man who had it all together on the outside missed it all together on the inside.  Step into the shoes of a prominent family of the tribe of Judah as you witness the tragedy of faithless failure, contrasted against a very surprising demonstration of faith.  The whole sermon builds up to a shocking crescendo at the very end.",

The Covenant is in His Blood and only those in right relationship to Christ enjoy the benefits of that covenant.  It is not what you know but Who you know that matters.",
