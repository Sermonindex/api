A certain German man punished his child for wrongdoing by telling him to learn Ps 119 off by heart. Within one and a half hours the boy recited the whole psalm to his father, without a mistake. People's gifts are different. It doesn't matter how well you can remember; what is important is that you obey and keep the Word which God gives you, even if it's just a verse.",
