            "description": "The Christmas event shook everyone on earth, in heaven and even in hell. When Adam and Eve sinned they were expelled from the garden and cherubims with flaming swords were placed to prevent them from entering again. Now in our text, it says the angels came to the shepherds. So though the angels stopped anybody from entering into paradise, now it was the angels who brought the glad tidings that anyone can enter into glory through the birth of the Saviour. Do you see the awesome wonder of Christmas! God opening this gate that was closed. Though we give each other gifts at Christmas they fade into insignificance in comparison to that which we received from God at Christmas.",
