Can you say you've been honest with God and you are dedicated to His purposes? In this last hour of time, let the Church of Jesus Christ cry out for boldness and ask God to do something so sovereign that everyone will see His mercy through our lives. We must cry out to God and ask Him to increase our testimony so it can be a virtuous bride who brings glory to the name of Jesus.",
