In these times of sudden calamity the initial response may be fear, but we must trust that God has everything under control. He has a million ways to solve our problems. Usually in these times God is the only one that can give us answers. We must turn off every voice of humanity. God's people get their answers from one place and that is the Bible. God is calling His people in the secret closet of prayer so we can get a Word from Him. Don't let the Sunday morning blessings fade into the troubles of this day. Encourage yourself in the Lord!",
