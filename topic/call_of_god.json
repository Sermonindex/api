            "description": "Katz here expounds upon and builds his message upon the story of the rich man's confrontation with Jesus. \"Alot of us are in a much lesser place with God, because we have not understood the totality, the radical demand, the utterness of the whole commitment to God that constitutes entry into the kingdom and also entry into life\". Have you yet come to the totality that is intrinsic to the call of God? After listening to this sermon, the answer will no longer elude you.",

Its neat to hear how he had such a hard time doing missionary work but the closed doors were from God to make Him even more effect to setup and fund missionaries primarly from home, bring that awareness and need to the local church body in his area.",
