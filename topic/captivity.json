If we are called by God the powers of darkness know the potential we have in Christ. When we come to our red sea of impossibility God promises every enemy will be drowned behind us. There is a glory that will come upon a people who choose to get into the Word of God and simply declare the impossible possible. There will be a people in this last hour of time who have the testimony of Jesus Christ and a glory song that the world must reckon with. This day captivity will be broken and your song will be, \"only God can do this\"!! It is time to go forward into the miraculous!",
