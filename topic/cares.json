            "description": "Hans Waldvogel speaks of how God cares for believers and even in the small things such as our very hairs on our head. Our Heavenly Father gives such care and attention to our life as we submit to his Lordship. We can give all parts of our being and life to him and we dishonour him when we do not submit to Him. God is to be the absolute ruler and king of our body, spirit and soul. Through the tests and trials in life allows us to continually choice to keep and trust our Lord with all our cares.",
