            "description": "Brother Edgar shares very powerful accounts of suffering of true disciples of Jesus in the underground Church in China. In comparison in the West we fall so short of the same authentic reality of these simple believers. This message is a informational message but also a call by the Holy Spirit to us in other countries to follow Jesus Christ whole-heartily in revival.",
