Tozer\u2019s reply to today\u2019s ubiquitous question, \u201cWhat is God\u2019s purpose for me?\u201d Just as you can tell what a hammer and a saw are for by looking at what they are, you can tell what a man is for by looking at what he is. 1 Peter 2:8-10 lists four things that a Christian is, and from these a Christian may know what he is for. This is number 20 in Pastor Tozer\u2019s series of 34 sermons based upon the first epistle of Peter. The message was delivered on February 14, 1954, from the pulpit of Southside Alliance Church in Chicago, Illinois. It is 23 minutes and 43 seconds in length.",
