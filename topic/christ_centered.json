            "description": "In this sombre prophetic message we look at the departing of many from the heart of Christ.Jesus warned the Ephesians that if they did not repent He would remove the candlestick from the midst.Alas today there are assemblies that resemble the tin man from the movie the wizard of Oz.They function,move,skip and dance along a golden road and yet they have no heart.The glory of God has departed and they have been found naked and  at home in their nakedness.It is my prayer that many would hear this message and encourage others to listen as i truly believe it to be applicable to this hour.",
