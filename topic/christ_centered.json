Through a man of God, witnesses and the inner witness of Gods Spirit, he heard the call to the ministry of preaching the gospel around the world. As John Wesley said \"the world is my parish\" and Scott believes this vision has been passed on to him. In the providence of Almighty God Scott had the great Joy of working in the Roman Catholic community with the elderly. He made sure that these old men and women received the Gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ. He found this experience overwhelming through the love of his master and rejoices in that Christ can set you free from any bondage including deep hatred.\r\nScott recently returned home to Northern Ireland after a few years in Australia as an itinerant Evangelist and Pastor.The Lord has led Scott to plant a church in his home town of Portadown and Pillar Christian Church belongs to the Assemblies of God in Ireland.",
