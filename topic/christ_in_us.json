We may be sure of its presence by tasting the water. Likewise the indwelling Christ may be realised by His love He imparts to us. Jesus said that He is the Way, the Truth and the Life. When you have Him you've found the way. When you have Him you have the Truth and abundant life. If Christ is a reality to you He leads and guides you. Everybody who tastes you will experience Christ.",
