            "description": "\u201cChristendom\u201d was addressed to the attendants of a Christian conference, probably some time between 1960 and 1962. It is 54 minutes, 17 seconds in length. Although the recording intermittently skips words, its sound quality is otherwise good and A. W. Tozer\u2019s valuable lesson can be easily understood. This is a radically challenging message that issues a degree of conviction that believers may find very unpleasant to accept. Pastors, ask yourselves whether you can point at your church and then at your Bible and say, \u201cThis is that.\u201d Are you really in spiritual succession to Abraham? John 8:31-42.",
