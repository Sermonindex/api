His appeal and influence transcended denominational lines, and he spoke to many different groups of people.\r\n\r\nThroughout his ministry, Vance Havner lived and preached that a Christian should should exhibit faithfulness to Jesus in all areas of life.

Now, as the director of a ministry called \"Servant Quarters,\" he spends his time speaking at conferences and retreats (as he works on his third million miles of flying) and writing. His humorous style delights audiences of all ages wherever he goes.\r\nGayle's first book, The Jesus Style, has sold more than 500,000 copies and has been translated into 35 languages. Many churches and missions groups require their leaders to study this book. Gayle Erwin travels around the globe playing, as he puts it, \"the one string on my guitar.\" That \"one string\" is the Nature of Jesus, a message developed over a lifetime of study and experience -- a simple message of servant lifestyle for this complex age.",

We all have a sin nature in us that desires to make choices apart from the will of God. God gave us the law as a school master to prove to us that we can't keep it. When we try to struggle our way out of a situation we are being God in that area. When we try to defeat sin in our own strength we are being God in that area. God the Father and Jesus Christ made a covenant with each other to put an end to sin and the power it has over us. It is only when we bend our knee to God and put our faith in the finished work of the Cross the struggle stops and God can be God to us. WE don't make promises to God, He makes them to us and He keeps them. It is not about works, it is all about faith in what Christ has already done.",

We pray that he will be honored and the Lord glorified by this attempt to share this legacy with all who would live a life of faith that is truly pleasing to God.\r\nThere came a time when Manley believed the Lord gave him a choice of complete healing or daily healing. Manley chose daily healing because for him it was an act of faith that each day the Lord had to heal him to the point that he could get out of bed. During those years there were more confinements in the hospital, as well as trips to Europe and revivals all over the United States.

His appeal and influence transcended denominational lines, and he spoke to many different groups of people.\r\n\r\nThroughout his ministry, Vance Havner lived and preached that a Christian should should exhibit faithfulness to Jesus in all areas of life.  He taught that the Christian should attend to, \"the outliving of the inliving Christ.\"  Havner wrote, \"To some, Christianity is an argument.  To many, it is a performance.

As a young man he became aware that the Lord was calling him into the work of the ministry. At timely stages the Lord placed folk in his path who were able to direct him into the truth of heart purity and a more expansive understanding of the ministry of the Holy Spirit. He held pastorates in Kent and Bradford. By the late 1960s, following a significant period of ministry in Liverpool, he began a more itinerant ministry. This led him to many parts of the world, and occupied him until well into his eighties. His powerful preaching and the unique sense of the Lord's presence, which seemed to brood over his meetings, were always intensely challenging.\r\nThe true secret of his remarkable ministry stemmed from his personal communion with the Lord Jesus. To him, 'entering the holiest' was not merely a theological concept; it was a distinct spiritual reality - and the central feature of his spiritual life. It was here, in the place of worship, that his revelatory ministry found its source. He preached from understanding and conviction. He was never the echo of another, nor did he take on board the ebb and flow of various contemporary emphases. He was not a man of 'books'; he soaked himself in Scripture and allowed it to saturate his heart and mind. Truly, this is a man who has lifted up a standard for the people. Mr North went to be with the Lord on 29th April 2003, shortly after his ninetieth birthday.",

During this time Stewart completed his Master's in Theology at Wheaton College Graduate School (where he was awarded the Kenneth Kantzer prize for theology) and ministered on college campuses in Chicago with InterVarsity Christian Fellowship. The combination of Resurrection, Wheaton College, and InterVarsity provided a most dynamic training season for the ministry. Here he learned how to lead (especially in regard to vision and liturgy), how to minister in the power of the Holy Spirit, and how to read and preach God's Word and to study the teachings of the Great Tradition.\r\n\r\nAnother ministry passion of Stewart's is raising up leaders and church planters.  In September 2013, Stewart was consecrated Bishop of the Anglican Diocese of the Upper Midwest (ACNA).

As a young man he became aware that the Lord was calling him into the work of the ministry. At timely stages the Lord placed folk in his path who were able to direct him into the truth of heart purity and a more expansive understanding of the ministry of the Holy Spirit. He held pastorates in Kent and Bradford. By the late 1960s, following a significant period of ministry in Liverpool, he began a more itinerant ministry. This led him to many parts of the world, and occupied him until well into his eighties. His powerful preaching and the unique sense of the Lord's presence, which seemed to brood over his meetings, were always intensely challenging.\r\nThe true secret of his remarkable ministry stemmed from his personal communion with the Lord Jesus. To him, 'entering the holiest' was not merely a theological concept; it was a distinct spiritual reality - and the central feature of his spiritual life. It was here, in the place of worship, that his revelatory ministry found its source. He preached from understanding and conviction. He was never the echo of another, nor did he take on board the ebb and flow of various contemporary emphases. He was not a man of 'books'; he soaked himself in Scripture and allowed it to saturate his heart and mind. Truly, this is a man who has lifted up a standard for the people. Mr North went to be with the Lord on 29th April 2003, shortly after his ninetieth birthday.",

For over 70 years, the church was blessed and challenged by the prophetic ministry of Vance Havner. His style and burden was prophetic similar to the ministry of A.W. Tozer calling the Church to revival. His influence extended to a national level, but Dr. Havner's approach was always to minister where God directed, regardless of the size of the church.  His appeal and influence transcended denominational lines, and he spoke to many different groups of people.\r\n\r\nThroughout his ministry, Vance Havner lived and preached that a Christian should should exhibit faithfulness to Jesus in all areas of life.  He taught that the Christian should attend to, \"the outliving of the inliving Christ.\"  Havner wrote, \"To some, Christianity is an argument.  To many, it is a performance.  To a few, it is an experience.\"",

As a young man he became aware that the Lord was calling him into the work of the ministry. At timely stages the Lord placed folk in his path who were able to direct him into the truth of heart purity and a more expansive understanding of the ministry of the Holy Spirit. He held pastorates in Kent and Bradford. By the late 1960s, following a significant period of ministry in Liverpool, he began a more itinerant ministry. This led him to many parts of the world, and occupied him until well into his eighties. His powerful preaching and the unique sense of the Lord's presence, which seemed to brood over his meetings, were always intensely challenging.\r\nThe true secret of his remarkable ministry stemmed from his personal communion with the Lord Jesus. To him, 'entering the holiest' was not merely a theological concept; it was a distinct spiritual reality - and the central feature of his spiritual life. It was here, in the place of worship, that his revelatory ministry found its source. He preached from understanding and conviction. He was never the echo of another, nor did he take on board the ebb and flow of various contemporary emphases. He was not a man of 'books'; he soaked himself in Scripture and allowed it to saturate his heart and mind. Truly, this is a man who has lifted up a standard for the people. Mr North went to be with the Lord on 29th April 2003, shortly after his ninetieth birthday.",

For over 70 years, the church was blessed and challenged by the prophetic ministry of Vance Havner. His style and burden was prophetic similar to the ministry of A.W. Tozer calling the Church to revival. His influence extended to a national level, but Dr. Havner's approach was always to minister where God directed, regardless of the size of the church.  His appeal and influence transcended denominational lines, and he spoke to many different groups of people.\r\n\r\nThroughout his ministry, Vance Havner lived and preached that a Christian should should exhibit faithfulness to Jesus in all areas of life.  He taught that the Christian should attend to, \"the outliving of the inliving Christ.\"  Havner wrote, \"To some, Christianity is an argument.  To many, it is a performance.  To a few, it is an experience.\"",

Pastor Derek and Stacey Melton planted Pryor ON Fire Teen Ministries in 1991, having a deep burden to reach the troubled youth of our generation with the saving gospel of Jesus Christ. This burden soon gave birth to an opportunity for teens to begin meeting in a small classroom south of Pryor. This was the birth of Pryor ON Fire Teen Ministries. After a short time that small classroom was packed and overflowing so the meetings were moved to two different locations, both of which were outgrown. The ministry continued to expand and grow as Thunderbird Youth Academy began to bus their cadets to the services weekly to join with local youth. In January of 1999, Pastor Derek and Stacey once again, felt the undeniable burden of the Lord to plant a church for adults who had began to attend these teen services. Grace Life Church was born out of this burden. The ministry was then moved to 110 E. Graham, where the ministry has purchased two properties giving the ministry 14,000 sq. ft., and a sanctuary that will seat over 250. The ministry resides in this location today.\r\nToday, Pastor Derek and Stacey continue to experience a deep burden for at-risk youth struggling in our generation, ministering Jesus Christ and His love to hurting teens several times per week. Grace Life Church is also a godly presence in our city, as many families have found their place in this Christ exalting body of believers. These members are maturing in Christ from glory to glory.",

As a young man he became aware that the Lord was calling him into the work of the ministry. At timely stages the Lord placed folk in his path who were able to direct him into the truth of heart purity and a more expansive understanding of the ministry of the Holy Spirit. He held pastorates in Kent and Bradford. By the late 1960s, following a significant period of ministry in Liverpool, he began a more itinerant ministry. This led him to many parts of the world, and occupied him until well into his eighties. His powerful preaching and the unique sense of the Lord's presence, which seemed to brood over his meetings, were always intensely challenging.\r\nThe true secret of his remarkable ministry stemmed from his personal communion with the Lord Jesus. To him, 'entering the holiest' was not merely a theological concept; it was a distinct spiritual reality - and the central feature of his spiritual life. It was here, in the place of worship, that his revelatory ministry found its source. He preached from understanding and conviction. He was never the echo of another, nor did he take on board the ebb and flow of various contemporary emphases. He was not a man of 'books'; he soaked himself in Scripture and allowed it to saturate his heart and mind. Truly, this is a man who has lifted up a standard for the people. Mr North went to be with the Lord on 29th April 2003, shortly after his ninetieth birthday.",

Paul Washer said he was one of the most godly men he met in Canada.\r\n\r\nBill Mcleod had been praying and had his congregation praying for revival for years. On, October 17, 1971, God in His sovereignty came in revival. Without human means or explanation, the revival spread from church to church, community to community, city to city, and not long after from province to province. This has become known as the 1971 Canadian Revival movement.",

Stewart is married to Katherine, and they have six children.

Stewart first came to Church of the Resurrection as a Wheaton College junior on Palm Sunday, 1988. Katherine and he learned from and served under Fr. William and Anne Beasley for a decade at Resurrection. During this time Stewart completed his Master's in Theology at Wheaton College Graduate School (where he was awarded the Kenneth Kantzer prize for theology) and ministered on college campuses in Chicago with InterVarsity Christian Fellowship. The combination of Resurrection, Wheaton College, and InterVarsity provided a most dynamic training season for the ministry. Here he learned how to lead (especially in regard to vision and liturgy), how to minister in the power of the Holy Spirit, and how to read and preach God's Word and to study the teachings of the Great Tradition.\r\n\r\nAnother ministry passion of Stewart's is raising up leaders and church planters.  In September 2013, Stewart was consecrated Bishop of the Anglican Diocese of the Upper Midwest (ACNA). By the end of 2018, the Upper Midwest Diocese will have planted 35 new churches in 7 states since being formed a diocese in June 2013. He has a vision to see a Revival of Word and Sacrament infused by the Holy Spirit in the Upper Midwest.",

Niranam has immense historical significance in the tradition of Saint Thomas, a disciple of Jesus Christ who planted the first church there in AD 52.  K.P. Yohannan dedicated his life to God at a young age to serve the needy and downtrodden. He prayed, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Oh my Lord, let my heart break with the things that break Your heart\u00e2\u20ac\u009d and his life was never the same. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s his belief that one can only demonstrate God\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s love by loving people. After over four decades of selfless service, he says, I have no regrets in praying that prayer for I know God has touched millions through what He did in and through me. It is all God\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s grace.\r\n\r\nHe spent the early years of his service in North India and traveled to the remote villages sharing the love of Christ and doing charitable works. Through numerous encounters during those years, he was instilled with an increasing passion to bring hope, peace, and comfort to the needy and deprived. His sacrificial commitment, farsightedness and aptitude to perceive helped him to lead a life of unhindered devotion to serve Christ and His church. K.P. Yohannan is also the voice of Athmeeya Yathra, touching millions through his daily radio and TV broadcasts. His 250 books offer practical and spiritual guidance on hundreds of subjects.",

During this time Stewart completed his Master's in Theology at Wheaton College Graduate School (where he was awarded the Kenneth Kantzer prize for theology) and ministered on college campuses in Chicago with InterVarsity Christian Fellowship. The combination of Resurrection, Wheaton College, and InterVarsity provided a most dynamic training season for the ministry. Here he learned how to lead (especially in regard to vision and liturgy), how to minister in the power of the Holy Spirit, and how to read and preach God's Word and to study the teachings of the Great Tradition.\r\n\r\nAnother ministry passion of Stewart's is raising up leaders and church planters.  In September 2013, Stewart was consecrated Bishop of the Anglican Diocese of the Upper Midwest (ACNA). By the end of 2018, the Upper Midwest Diocese will have planted 35 new churches in 7 states since being formed a diocese in June 2013.

We pray that he will be honored and the Lord glorified by this attempt to share this legacy with all who would live a life of faith that is truly pleasing to God.\r\nThere came a time when Manley believed the Lord gave him a choice of complete healing or daily healing. Manley chose daily healing because for him it was an act of faith that each day the Lord had to heal him to the point that he could get out of bed. During those years there were more confinements in the hospital, as well as trips to Europe and revivals all over the United States. He led Bible Conferences, revivals, and shared his personal testimony with others dealing with illness.",

Stewart first came to Church of the Resurrection as a Wheaton College junior on Palm Sunday, 1988. Katherine and he learned from and served under Fr.

During this time Stewart completed his Master's in Theology at Wheaton College Graduate School (where he was awarded the Kenneth Kantzer prize for theology) and ministered on college campuses in Chicago with InterVarsity Christian Fellowship. The combination of Resurrection, Wheaton College, and InterVarsity provided a most dynamic training season for the ministry. Here he learned how to lead (especially in regard to vision and liturgy), how to minister in the power of the Holy Spirit, and how to read and preach God's Word and to study the teachings of the Great Tradition.\r\n\r\nAnother ministry passion of Stewart's is raising up leaders and church planters.  In September 2013, Stewart was consecrated Bishop of the Anglican Diocese of the Upper Midwest (ACNA). By the end of 2018, the Upper Midwest Diocese will have planted 35 new churches in 7 states since being formed a diocese in June 2013.

Tozer calling the Church to revival. His influence extended to a national level, but Dr. Havner's approach was always to minister where God directed, regardless of the size of the church.  His appeal and influence transcended denominational lines, and he spoke to many different groups of people.\r\n\r\nThroughout his ministry, Vance Havner lived and preached that a Christian should should exhibit faithfulness to Jesus in all areas of life.  He taught that the Christian should attend to, \"the outliving of the inliving Christ.\"  Havner wrote, \"To some, Christianity is an argument.  To many, it is a performance.  To a few, it is an experience.\"",
