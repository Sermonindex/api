Ten major persecutions in the 1st and 2nd centuries, along with some key martyrs, are outlined.  Parkyns highlights major heresies that arose during that timeframe and how the 'official church' began branding Bible believing Christians as heretics.",

            "description": "Parkyns commences a new era in the Church from the 4th through 6th centuries.  Persecution of the 1st and 2nd centuries phased out as Christianity became universally accepted starting with Constantine (313 AD).  New creeds formed to combat new heresies, but even the biblically based creeds turned into dead orthodoxy, which gave rise to counter movements.  Parkyns outlines gospel developments, monastic orders, and adoption of paganism by the 'official church' in Europe (particularly the British Isles), the rise to preeminence of the bishop of Rome, and a renewed interest in the Church about the coming of the Antichrist.",

He introduces the book of Revelation as a love letter from the Bridegroom to the Bride about what to expect, though written in code, to be understood by His Word.  Parkyns sees God behind the scenes of Chuch history, not this net of jumbled doctrines, personalities and heresies as many have portrayed it.",

Is the book of Revelation speaking of things totally in the future, or are there legitimate evidence from the historical record that indeed show that prophecy has been completed?  Join Edgar Parkyns as he sheds light upon the often mysterious apocalyptic language of prophecy--\"the ten horns\", \"the man of sin\"--and presents these alongside the obvious events of the history of the Church.

God continually reveals His hidden wisdom for our spiritual blessings by His Holy Spirit.

It then progresses through the history of heresy and apostasy in the Church -- ranging from Platonic dualism, Manicheanism, Augustine's doctrines of original sin and infant baptism, etc. A quote from the message says it all: \"We had a Protestant Reformation, and oh, it did everything but reform! It was good, but it didn't go far enough -- it didn't reform.\"",
