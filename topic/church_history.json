Ten major persecutions in the 1st and 2nd centuries, along with some key martyrs, are outlined.  Parkyns highlights major heresies that arose during that timeframe and how the 'official church' began branding Bible believing Christians as heretics.",

            "description": "Parkyns commences a new era in the Church from the 4th through 6th centuries.  Persecution of the 1st and 2nd centuries phased out as Christianity became universally accepted starting with Constantine (313 AD).  New creeds formed to combat new heresies, but even the biblically based creeds turned into dead orthodoxy, which gave rise to counter movements.  Parkyns outlines gospel developments, monastic orders, and adoption of paganism by the 'official church' in Europe (particularly the British Isles), the rise to preeminence of the bishop of Rome, and a renewed interest in the Church about the coming of the Antichrist.",
