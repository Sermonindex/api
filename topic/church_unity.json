            "description": "Francis Chan speaks on a very important subject of Church Unity and the sacredness of the Church. This message warns as the Scripture does: \"If anyone destroys God\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s temple, God will destroy that person; for God\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s temple is sacred.\" In the body of Christ in North America especially there is a great need to hear this message. To see God's people as holy and all of us as a body of Christ together and not to bite and devour one another as we are wounding Christ Himself who we share in.",
