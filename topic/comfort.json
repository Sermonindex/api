            "description": "When the Holy Spirit convicts us of our sins and we confess and forsake them and are washed by the Blood of Jesus, then we shall experience the true comfort of the Holy Spirit. To those who love God, all things work together for good. We don't know what the future holds, but we know Him who holds the future. When Jesus departed, His disciples were sorrowful. Jesus said to them, 'It is expedient for you that I go, for when I depart, the Comforter will come - the Holy Spirit'. In verse 2 we read, \"Fulfill my joy by being like-minded, having the same love, being of one accord, of one mind\". God's people can live in this world of sin and in the devil's domain, being 'likeminded, having the same love, being of one accord, of one mind.' It is a foretaste of heaven, when God's people dwell together in such unity. Such a life is completely dedicated to God. That life and Spirit which was in Christ Jesus must also be in you.",
