It is much more simple than most think, yet much more vital to allow this communion, even hungrily seek it, than we realize. Jesus would not have asked the Father to send us a Comforter he knew we wouldn't need. We need to know why he was sent, why he dwells in us, and allow him to do what the Father sent him to do.",

What are our controlling ambitions with respect to holiness? 3) They exhibit obedience of faith, an enduring commitment to Christ as absolute Lord, whole-souled devotion that brings every thought captive to Christ; 4) they are beloved of God, who delights in those who reflect his own perfections, by nature we have nothing but God in sovereign grace makes us after his image in holiness.
