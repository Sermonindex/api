He shares the compassion the Lord has for those who society marginalizes and does not help. We all as the body of Christ can share the love of Jesus with others around us, this message will encourage you to do so.",

Listen to these two messages about investing in the harvest. When we are out doing the work that Christ has called us to do, we impact the lives of others. It may not seem like we are doing anything at the time \u00e2\u20ac\u201c but our home is not here on earth. Jesus said live for things that will not perish. God is eternal, so live for Him.",
