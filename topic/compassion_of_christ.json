            "description": "November 18, 2007 - When we intermingle with the ways of the world, we lose sight of God's ways. We are not called to have the earth bless us, we are called to bless the earth. Our cry has to be \"Jesus, touch us and cause us to see what you see and feel what you feel! Lord, cause us to have something deeper than sporadic bursts of kindness.\" Our eyes should be opened to the compassion of Christ and our hands should be committed to make a difference in society. When we move out in this direction, there is a divine power imputed to us for the work of the Lord.",
