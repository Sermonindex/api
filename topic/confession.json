He breaks it down piece by piece the application to believers and non-believers.  How much do I need to confess and to whom, according to the Bible?  What am I to do if my brother is the one who is in the wrong...and he won't make it right?",

            "description": "September 13, 2009 - Today is a day of mercy and grace. God is gently calling out to those who are backslidden, those who have grown cold and those who need to make things right with God. The first call of Jesus is of love and forgiveness. The second call is, \"You make a move\"! The Bible says, \"today if you hear His voice harden not your heart\". Jesus is coming soon, so get up and shake yourself form the dirt and when you rise up the shackles of captivity and sin will fall off!",
