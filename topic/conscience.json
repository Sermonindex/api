We get a \"redefinition\" of sin. We get a redefinition of Truth. There is even a redefinition of the voice of the conscience. Some worldly philosophers define conscience as the culmination of all the good behaviors learned over childhood from parents. But the Scriptures talk about conscience as being from God. Paul speaks of it by name in Romans 2:15 and Romans 9:1. And, as Dr. Tozer points out in this message, the voice of the conscience is always on God's side, never the world's.",
