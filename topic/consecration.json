            "description": "The physical body is not evil; the Roman Catholic church alleges that sin had its source in the body, when bodily appetites transgressed the dictates of reason; but Scripture teaches that the body is honorable: the body was created before the spirit, death is an evil because it separates the body and spirit, and the final step in redemption is the reuniting of body and spirit at the resurrection; Paul's practical exhortation accords to the body great importance in the process of sanctification; use of our body must be guided by what is pleasing to God; presenting our bodies for holy living is a service and devotion to God; use of the body must not be conformed to the present evil age; it is difficult to practice the Christian faith, because this evil age constantly pressures us to adopt its customs; but the present age will pass away, and if our conduct is patterned on this age it will bring us into perdition.",

            "description": "\"We all have our Amalek,\" Campbell says, but how do we react to hell's engagement?  Starting with a personal testimony seeing first hand the warfare of the devil in a crowded farmhouse packed with sinners seeking salvation, he segues into the vital necessity of character before God--clean hands and a pure heart.  Campbell repeatedly warns against the overemphasis of man in modern evangelism, hymns and even one's own consecration, pleading for God to be all in all.",

            "description": "Campbell extracts principles for revival from 2 Kings 3 where the lack of water refers to the one thing that would ensure victory: the power of the Holy Ghost.  The three main points were 1) the futility of mere human effort, 2) faith that wins through, and 3) the fulness that met the need.  Brother Duncan powerfully illustrates a spirit of inquiry and an acknowledgement of need in the Arnol revival \"when the farmhouse shook\".  \"The digging may involve a cost,\" he challenged, a self-denial of forgetting oneself \"in a desire to prepare the way for God.\"",
