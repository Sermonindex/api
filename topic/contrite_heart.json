Jacob lied, and stole from his brother, but he had a contrite heart. Even though throughout his life he endured many trials, God was with him, all the way. Throughout the 14 years he spent working to marry Rachel, conflict with his fatherinlaw, conflict between his two wives, fear of his brother, his daugther being attacked, and his sons committing murder, to the disappearance of Joseph, and the famine in the land that arose later, God kept Jacob, and his family, and they were never in any real danger. In the end, Jacob's testimony was, \"at 130 years old, few and evil have the days of the years of my life been. \" (Gen. 47:9).  Many are the afflictions of the righteous, but the Lord delivereth him out of them all. Ps. 34:19",
