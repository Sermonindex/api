Tozer intimates, \u201cMy friend, the wisest man in the world is the man who knows the most about God.\u201d Only as things are seen from the sanctuary may they truly be seen in focus. Through 1 Peter 2:17 and a loving exegesis of Psalm 104, Pastor Tozer illuminates two of \u201cthe five things the Christian should do if he is to grow in grace and in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ:\u201d 1) Venerate all things; 2) Honor all men; 3) Love all Christians; 4) Fear God; 5) Honor the authorities. \u201cVenerate All God\u2019s Creation\u201d is the 24th message in a 34-part study of Peter\u2019s first epistle. Recorded on March 14, 1954, in Chicago, Illinois, the sermon is 40 minutes and 34 seconds in length.",

A \"20th-century prophet\" many called him during his lifetime. For 31 years A.W.Tozer was pastor of Southside Alliance Church in Chicago. He was involved in the missionary alliance movement for most of his pulpit life. A.W. Tozer lived in the presence of God he saw clearly and he spoke as a prophet to the church. He sought for God's honor with the zeal of Elijah and mourned with Jeremiah at the apostasy of God's people. \r\n\r\nLeonard Ravenhill was a close friend of pastor and writer A. W. Tozer and spoke of him as one of the most influential voices in the Church in America. A.W. Tozer's materials are a mainstay in Evangelical churches in our day and he is one of the most quoted authors. He was a prophet in his day and his writings are even more influential in our day. One of his books: The Pursuit of God, has had over 1 million copies sold world-wide.",

God has built in instincts and traits (micro-systems) so that animals behave and do things which really wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be possible through evolution. How great a God we serve, how wise in His creation surely the creation shows forth His handiwork. Elohim (plural) trinity of God. V26 let us make man in our (plural, trinity) image. If God created me with a capacity of choice unless I had the ability to choose. So freedom of choice is given to men and the opposite of what good is given so people can choice what is actually good. God influences choices because He loves and cares for us, but we have the right to not choose God. God will not force His choice upon us, He is an gentleman. In pictures of Christ there is an attempt to define Him in form. It is more God honoring according to the commandment of not making an graven image of God to not make any image of Jesus Christ. Gods will for original man is to be fruitful and multiply and to subdue the earth. All the animals at that point lived off the grasses and vegetation, there was no carnivous animals. God rested meaning that He was not exhausted but that the creation was completed. This chapter gives the first look at creation, but the next chapter gives an more detailed version of the creation of man. And God is revealed in a different name: Jehovah. This different name of God curtails the relationship between God and man. What is important is what did God say not who did He say it through.",
