The Cross is the power of God in Christ to overpower all the forces of darkness. Because of the Cross the impossible becomes possible. So how do we embrace the power of the Cross? The answer is simple. You can stare at the Cross in unbelief or you can put out your hand by faith and take the victory. We cannot have sin in our life and have the power of the Cross. You have to choose to walk out of sin and walk into the power of God!",

Her masters, who had profited much, were furious, and had Paul and Silas stripped and beaten. But this did not beat God's servants for Jesus is victorious over demonic power. They sang the praises of God in the cruel jail and stocks, till heaven could not remain silent and the earth shook with God's power.",

            "description": "Just like Isaiah saw the Lord on a throne, high and lifted up, beholding the train of the his glory, and as a result Isaiah came to apprehend what he was.  So also we need an apprehension of God as demonstrated through the cross to know what we are.  If we are not able to behold the cross, and see how God demonstrated himself, how will our idolitries be abolished?  To the degree that our perception of God is distorted, so also are we distorted.  With unconventional wisdom, Art Katz relishes in all that the cross will afford its most ardent adherents.  He bids the church to drop their porcelain and sentimental attachments to creedal views of Calvary.  We are warned in this sermon that a Christianity which is ever fixated upon the initial salvation level the cross affords, will never challenge the status quo in this world.",

From the garden on through the resurrection circumstances revealed.  No more were they boasting of their capacity to be the greatest.  During the dark night of the crisis of the Christ, all was revealed.  It is in this that the Apostle Paul gloried, nothing other than the cross of Christ, for nothing else has the capacity to reveal what we are.   The sufferings of Christ, viewed with sincerity, will always beget personal revelation.  We must be apprehended by the cross.  If this is not the case, then we will be absolutely unable to serve God in any form of spiritual community.  Just like it was a suffering for Christ to display the truth of who he was, so also, our apprehension of the truth of what we are will be suffering.",

            "description": "Starting with a quote from C.H. Spurgeon, \"Jesus bears not the cross so that you may escape it, but that you may endure it,\" this sermon delivers a message which adopts and adheres the previous two messages into our own bearing of the cross.  It is stated herein that one of the greatest libels against the cross in our day is the idea that the believer in the cross is absented from any form of suffering.  It is the cruciform life which will generate a necessary friction against the kingdoms of this world.  We must apprehend that this conflict is an intention of God through his people, and in every sense, a diet of the things of this world will by nature slicken any apprehension of this cross-centered friction.   The hearing of this sermon in its deepest of intentions will bring you face to face with Jesus calling you Satan, that is to say...you are Satanic if you cherish not the things of God over the things of man. We are admonished to take up the cross and follow Christ for, \"Natural man is always the instrument by which Satanic things are brought into being in the collision between kingdoms.\"",

            "description": "July 18, 2010 - Peter's problem was not that he was impetuous or quick at the lip. At the base of all Peter's issue was the Cross. The Cross doesn\u2019t promise that when we agree to walk with God that the storms in our lives will cease. The Cross doesn\u2019t offer a \u201cmountain top\u201d religion with all glory and no pain. There is nothing pretty or desirable about the Cross. Nobody wants to suffer or have the deepest issues of their heart uprooted. Nevertheless the Cross must become central to a Christian's life. When we choose to identify with the Cross we are choosing to die to a self-centered life and to live a life that is others-centered. Sometimes the biggest Cross we have to bear is coming to terms with the fact that we cannot bear our cross in our own strength. Give up your \u201cpower\u201d to help yourself and let God's power lift you up and take you where you cannot go in your own strength.",

The church that forms a false image will not endure when hard times come and they will abandon the journey of Christ to follow their own agenda. God in His mercy will allow this false image to be broken in pieces so we can go back to God and do things His way. When we are left with an empty shell and a cry in our heart that says, \"God I am nothing apart from you\", God will respond by filling us with His glory. If ever there is a time to cry out for the Holy Spirit to fill us it's now!",

At the Cross Jesus bore all our grief and sorrows. All guilt and condemnation is lifted because of His blood. At the Cross mercy and peace took on a human face. Jesus Christ made a covenant with His Father and His blood brings us everlasting peace.",
