He was initially associated with John R.Rice in the 1940's. However,after giving a scripturally based message on John 6 Before rice and some other fundamentalist leaders he was kicked out of the Fundamentalist camp. He then went on the independent circuit. His preaching tours as an evangelist were mainly in the American south.But he also ministered in the mid-west and Canada as well.",

From the garden on through the resurrection circumstances revealed.  No more were they boasting of their capacity to be the greatest.  During the dark night of the crisis of the Christ, all was revealed.  It is in this that the Apostle Paul gloried, nothing other than the cross of Christ, for nothing else has the capacity to reveal what we are.   The sufferings of Christ, viewed with sincerity, will always beget personal revelation.  We must be apprehended by the cross.  If this is not the case, then we will be absolutely unable to serve God in any form of spiritual community.  Just like it was a suffering for Christ to display the truth of who he was, so also, our apprehension of the truth of what we are will be suffering.",

Spurgeon, \"Jesus bears not the cross so that you may escape it, but that you may endure it,\" this sermon delivers a message which adopts and adheres the previous two messages into our own bearing of the cross.  It is stated herein that one of the greatest libels against the cross in our day is the idea that the believer in the cross is absented from any form of suffering.  It is the cruciform life which will generate a necessary friction against the kingdoms of this world.  We must apprehend that this conflict is an intention of God through his people, and in every sense, a diet of the things of this world will by nature slicken any apprehension of this cross-centered friction.   The hearing of this sermon in its deepest of intentions will bring you face to face with Jesus calling you Satan, that is to say...you are Satanic if you cherish not the things of God over the things of man. We are admonished to take up the cross and follow Christ for, \"Natural man is always the instrument by which Satanic things are brought into being in the collision between kingdoms.\"",

He was radically converted by reading the New Testament. God used him to have a powerful prophetic insight into the end-times and the coming suffering of the jewish people before the great accepting of Jesus as Messiah. His eschatological insight is a very needful truth to be realized in the body of Christ. \r\n\r\nArt was a prophetic voice insofar as he called his listeners to purposes in God that would affect both time and eternity, purposes that had to do with the glory of God in the Church.   Frequently, his messages called the Church to an awareness of the Last Days [End-times] in such a way that made that time seem imminent and at the door.",

Pastor Derek and Stacey Melton planted Pryor ON Fire Teen Ministries in 1991, having a deep burden to reach the troubled youth of our generation with the saving gospel of Jesus Christ. This burden soon gave birth to an opportunity for teens to begin meeting in a small classroom south of Pryor. This was the birth of Pryor ON Fire Teen Ministries. After a short time that small classroom was packed and overflowing so the meetings were moved to two different locations, both of which were outgrown. The ministry continued to expand and grow as Thunderbird Youth Academy began to bus their cadets to the services weekly to join with local youth. In January of 1999, Pastor Derek and Stacey once again, felt the undeniable burden of the Lord to plant a church for adults who had began to attend these teen services. Grace Life Church was born out of this burden. The ministry was then moved to 110 E. Graham, where the ministry has purchased two properties giving the ministry 14,000 sq. ft., and a sanctuary that will seat over 250. The ministry resides in this location today.\r\nToday, Pastor Derek and Stacey continue to experience a deep burden for at-risk youth struggling in our generation, ministering Jesus Christ and His love to hurting teens several times per week. Grace Life Church is also a godly presence in our city, as many families have found their place in this Christ exalting body of believers. These members are maturing in Christ from glory to glory.",

The Cross is more than being forgiven, more than being granted eternal life and more than receiving healing for our body soul and spirit. We are the fourth tabernacle that Jesus raised up with Himself that God wants to dwell in us and live with us seated at the right hand of God. When He said it is finished, the joy that was set before Him is the omnipresence of Christ dwelling in man.",

The Cross doesn\u2019t promise that when we agree to walk with God that the storms in our lives will cease. The Cross doesn\u2019t offer a \u201cmountain top\u201d religion with all glory and no pain. There is nothing pretty or desirable about the Cross. Nobody wants to suffer or have the deepest issues of their heart uprooted. Nevertheless the Cross must become central to a Christian's life. When we choose to identify with the Cross we are choosing to die to a self-centered life and to live a life that is others-centered. Sometimes the biggest Cross we have to bear is coming to terms with the fact that we cannot bear our cross in our own strength. Give up your \u201cpower\u201d to help yourself and let God's power lift you up and take you where you cannot go in your own strength.",
