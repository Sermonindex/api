            "description": "October 5, 2008 - It is imperative that everyone who belongs to the true Church of Jesus Christ learn the voice of God. In these last days demonic voices will arise to deceive us and lead us into captivity. How can we know when God is speaking to us? First, the voice of God will never promise us peace if we are embracing the same value system of the world. Second, the voice of God will challenge sin. In the dark days ahead the people of God will be lead into the tender mercies of God. God will give us a heart full of confidence when we choose to live uprightly.",
