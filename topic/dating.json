            "description": "If there is one area in the Church today where there exists much confusion, and where there is evidence that the world system has once again crept in and influenced the way Christians think and behave, it is in relationships before marriage. Although this topic might seem only to apply to young people about to get married, it is actually something that is relevant to all believers.",

He breaks down many preconceptions people have about courtship in a biblical sense. This is a very strong message but very important to listen to when we have almost lost all bibilcal instruction and decency in this area of courtship.",

As we go through this lesson, we are reminded that God's goals for relationships are spiritual in nature. As parents we are to teach our children about relationships, starting with godly friendship. We, as parents, are also responsible for controlling who our children date. What questions ought we to ask concerning the ones our children are interested in dating? How do we go about giving our children a road map of conviction they can follow during their teen years? What is the parent's responsibility? What is the child's responsibility? We will see that God has many principles regarding dating.",
