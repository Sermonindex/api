He was born in Newtownards, County Down, Ireland in 1911. In his book Tramp after God, he tells of living for more than three years as a tramp abusing alcohol and involved in crime. Willie Mullan had a religious conversion and from that time forward he decided he would strive to serve God.\r\n\r\n In 1953 Willie Mullan was called to Lurgan Baptist church, and in August of that year he commenced the work in Lurgan. One of his great accomplishments during this time was the Tuesday night Bible class. Every Tuesday night hundreds attended to hear the exposition of the Word. In 1957 William Hewitt and a team of helpers commenced the tape recordings of the Bible class. At least 1500 of these recordings remain until this day.",

There are some different facets of God that are often over-emphasized in religion resulting in disunity among the Body of Christ. There are some good things in each of them, but there must be a balance of them all, with God at the center. Mr. Fromke uses the father heart of David to illustrate that the proper touchstone that will hold us in balance is that God is a Father. This brings significance and relatedness to all the facets.",
