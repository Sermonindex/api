The problem with the Third Day doctrine was detected when I attended several classes on the subject, learning that the direction of this particular teaching stressed the second coming of the Lord Jesus Christ not in bodily form, but rather in the Church, the body of Christ. I love dearly all those who have so far been teaching this mistaken doctrine. I love dearly the pastor of the church in which this sermon was preached and only pray that by way of this humble and inadequate admonition, men and women within the body of Christ would stir themselves to watching and prayer, becoming vigorous students of the Word of God, quick to discern truth from error, and that the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and His eternal gospel would advance throughout our lifetime.",

Jesus makes a clear declaration for His church on this side of eternity that we are the salt of the earth and the light in a dark world. If our heart is one with God's heart, God will work supernaturally through us and we will become a living testimony for the redemption of man. The very life we live should create a thirst for the living God and His light should be seen in us.",
