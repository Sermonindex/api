I love dearly all those who have so far been teaching this mistaken doctrine. I love dearly the pastor of the church in which this sermon was preached and only pray that by way of this humble and inadequate admonition, men and women within the body of Christ would stir themselves to watching and prayer, becoming vigorous students of the Word of God, quick to discern truth from error, and that the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and His eternal gospel would advance throughout our lifetime.",
