He is often regarded as one of the most well-known bible teachers and preachers and pioneers of the Indian Church movements. He was India's foremost evangelist, preacher and indigenous church planter who founded churches based on New Testament principles. He began a worldwide indigenous church-planting movement in India that eventually saw more than 10,000 local churches. Norman Grubb missionary statesman, author and teacher: \"In all my missionary experience I think these churches on their New Testament foundations are the nearest I have seen to a replica of the early church and a pattern for the birth and growth of the young churches in all the countries which we used to talk about as mission fields.\"\r\nLife of prayer. Brother Bakht Singh was a man of prayer. He spent hours upon his knees in communion with the Lord seeking the Lord's mind regarding His will concerning the work and ministry. Therefore, the Lord also honored him and blessed him beyond any human understanding. This is one of the reasons why the Lord has used him so mightily for the edification of His Body and for the extension of His glorious kingdom both in India and abroad.",

Stewart is married to Katherine, and they have six children. Their first love and passion is raising their children and developing their family as a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153domestic church.\" They also consider it one of the great honors of their lives to serve Church of the Resurrection, where they marvel at the move of God they have been swept up in for the last 25 years. Stewart first came to Church of the Resurrection as a Wheaton College junior on Palm Sunday, 1988. Katherine and he learned from and served under Fr. William and Anne Beasley for a decade at Resurrection. During this time Stewart completed his Master's in Theology at Wheaton College Graduate School (where he was awarded the Kenneth Kantzer prize for theology) and ministered on college campuses in Chicago with InterVarsity Christian Fellowship. The combination of Resurrection, Wheaton College, and InterVarsity provided a most dynamic training season for the ministry. Here he learned how to lead (especially in regard to vision and liturgy), how to minister in the power of the Holy Spirit, and how to read and preach God's Word and to study the teachings of the Great Tradition.\r\n\r\nAnother ministry passion of Stewart's is raising up leaders and church planters.  In September 2013, Stewart was consecrated Bishop of the Anglican Diocese of the Upper Midwest (ACNA). By the end of 2018, the Upper Midwest Diocese will have planted 35 new churches in 7 states since being formed a diocese in June 2013. He has a vision to see a Revival of Word and Sacrament infused by the Holy Spirit in the Upper Midwest.",
