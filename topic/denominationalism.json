            "description": "Denominationalism is a prison for many and the spirit of this many need to be freed from. This sermon points out how the denominational spirit is the same that impelled the Pharisee's to emphasize their spiritual purity due to their Abrahamic pedigree. Brother Zac makes a strong case for the building of local bodies that are not connected through denominational structures that have leadership that use and abuse the sheep, but are overseen by truly spiritual brothers.",

God called brother Zac Poonen to a new work early on in his Christian experience. The movement is now called Christian Fellowship Churches where the New Covenant of New Testament Christianity is clearly preached. \r\n\r\nBrother Zac Poonen has written 25 books most of them being on the deeper Christian life. Many of these have been translated into a number of languages and have been circulated widely around the world. He clearly and passionately shares the  narrow way of Christian discipleship that is neglected by so many modern preachers.",
