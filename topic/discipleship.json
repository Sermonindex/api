He then considers the men who first received this commission, and the necessity of their transformation at Pentecost. Our attention is then drawn to the Christ of the Great Commission, especially his unlimited, unhindered, unending authority over all (v.18). Jesus referred to himself as the Son of Man many times, to show us who he really was, the fulfilment of Daniel\u2019s vision (Dan.7:13,14). There is only one true King and kingdom in the world today; lose sight of his sovereignty, and you lose the hope of missions. Finally Mr. Washer examines the commission itself - its foundation, commands, and effects - and asks whether our own lives and ministries are worthy of being exported to nations that have already been ravaged and confused by our false doctrines, false gospels, false evangelists, carnality and worldliness. He ends with a passionate plea for missions and missionaries, and an exhortation to confidence in the One who said, \u201cLo, I am with you alway\u201d (v.20). That\u2019s not a promise, he says, it\u2019s a FACT.  (79 minutes).",

I encourage you to watch the video. You can almost hear his heart pump with anguish for the precious souls who hear him. Let this be the sermon preached at your own funeral.
