He then considers the men who first received this commission, and the necessity of their transformation at Pentecost. Our attention is then drawn to the Christ of the Great Commission, especially his unlimited, unhindered, unending authority over all (v.18). Jesus referred to himself as the Son of Man many times, to show us who he really was, the fulfilment of Daniel\u2019s vision (Dan.7:13,14). There is only one true King and kingdom in the world today; lose sight of his sovereignty, and you lose the hope of missions. Finally Mr. Washer examines the commission itself - its foundation, commands, and effects - and asks whether our own lives and ministries are worthy of being exported to nations that have already been ravaged and confused by our false doctrines, false gospels, false evangelists, carnality and worldliness. He ends with a passionate plea for missions and missionaries, and an exhortation to confidence in the One who said, \u201cLo, I am with you alway\u201d (v.20). That\u2019s not a promise, he says, it\u2019s a FACT.  (79 minutes).",

Stewart first came to Church of the Resurrection as a Wheaton College junior on Palm Sunday, 1988. Katherine and he learned from and served under Fr.

During this time Stewart completed his Master's in Theology at Wheaton College Graduate School (where he was awarded the Kenneth Kantzer prize for theology) and ministered on college campuses in Chicago with InterVarsity Christian Fellowship. The combination of Resurrection, Wheaton College, and InterVarsity provided a most dynamic training season for the ministry. Here he learned how to lead (especially in regard to vision and liturgy), how to minister in the power of the Holy Spirit, and how to read and preach God's Word and to study the teachings of the Great Tradition.\r\n\r\nAnother ministry passion of Stewart's is raising up leaders and church planters.  In September 2013, Stewart was consecrated Bishop of the Anglican Diocese of the Upper Midwest (ACNA). By the end of 2018, the Upper Midwest Diocese will have planted 35 new churches in 7 states since being formed a diocese in June 2013.

His sacrificial commitment, farsightedness and aptitude to perceive helped him to lead a life of unhindered devotion to serve Christ and His church. K.P. Yohannan is also the voice of Athmeeya Yathra, touching millions through his daily radio and TV broadcasts. His 250 books offer practical and spiritual guidance on hundreds of subjects.",

For over 70 years, the church was blessed and challenged by the prophetic ministry of Vance Havner. His style and burden was prophetic similar to the ministry of A.W. Tozer calling the Church to revival. His influence extended to a national level, but Dr. Havner's approach was always to minister where God directed, regardless of the size of the church.  His appeal and influence transcended denominational lines, and he spoke to many different groups of people.\r\n\r\nThroughout his ministry, Vance Havner lived and preached that a Christian should should exhibit faithfulness to Jesus in all areas of life.  He taught that the Christian should attend to, \"the outliving of the inliving Christ.\"  Havner wrote, \"To some, Christianity is an argument.  To many, it is a performance.  To a few, it is an experience.\"",
