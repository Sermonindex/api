Why, that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the question: what is faith?  \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I have not found so great faith, no, not in Israel.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d  I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m often troubled when I pray for the sick.  Just recently I had that experience again.  I met some saints\u00e2\u20ac\u201dnot anybody that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s here; now, don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t feel bad; I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m not pointing right at you, see: somebody else\u00e2\u20ac\u201dbut saints.  I was praying for the sick, and talking faith, and praying faith, and God was there.  And these saints talked unbelief. You\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d be surprised how much unbelief is hanging on us.  The Bible talks about \u00e2\u20ac\u0153the sin that doth so easily beset us.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d  It sticks to us.  Die klebt uns an.  Grad wie die Kletten; das ist Unglaube.  It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s unbelief.  And you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d be surprised what mountains of unbelief there are in the saints.  You don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t find it out until the cat bites them, or a dog barks at them, or something else happens and they really have to believe God.  Why, then their faith is gone\u00e2\u20ac\u201dabsolutely gone.",
