            "description": "Dr. Smith here addresses the different kinds of hard drugs and specifically the ones that are labeled as \u201csorcery\u201d in the King James Version of Galatians.  Smith shows how sorcery is really speaking of drug induced \u201creligious\u201d experience or pharmakeia.  Smith argues that these drug induced stupor\u2019s are a means of compensating for true spirituality, in the sense that they crowd out the senses God has given us in order that we might choose to enter our prayer closets, reduce our sensory input, and hear from God",
