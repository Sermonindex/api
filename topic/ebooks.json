Yet at the same time we are hurtling toward unimaginable catastrophe. A fear and horror of that which is coming has, perhaps to some extent unconsciously, laid its grip on mankind. Yet for Christians the dark night of the future is lit by a brilliant star - the goodness of God the Father.

John Bjorlie wrote that he was a \"tidy-looking English gentleman with a bookish side who discovered ways of slipping into and out of countries that others just assumed were 'closed doors.' He was not a big man, and his pleasant, easygoing manner would not have conjured in your mind the picture of the fearless missionary.\"Born in Lancashire, England, Broadbent operated under the auspices of the Plymouth Brethren movement. His book, The Pilgrim Church, first published in 1931. The Pilgrim Church is an alternative history of the church, unrecorded by secular history. It covers the history of many small churches throughout the ages that have attempted to follow the New Testament church pattern, the success of those that followed the pattern laid out by the apostles and the consequences to the churches that fell away from the pattern. He looks broadly at many groups such as the Paulicians, the Bogomils, the Nestorians, the Waldensians, the Anabaptists, the Hutterites, the Methodists, the Russian Mennonites and the Mennonite Brethren. He classified early primitive churches to Anabaptist, and to Moravian Brethren were historical Brethren Movement.",

            "description": "We all have failed. We cringe at the very thought of it. Under the awful sting of regret and disappointment looms the question: What next? We may feel that we have forfeited God's Plan A for our lives and are now stuck with Plan B. We couldn't, however, be further from the truth. In When We Have Failed-What Next?, K.P. Yohannan graciously takes us on a journey toward a bright and hopeful future. He again and again depicts God's unfailing love for us and His marvelous ability to bring out His very best for our lives, especially in the midst of our failure. Look up, for the best is truly yet to come.",

The booklet encourages us to stand up for God and His commandments, yet with a love and compassion that issues from truth and not subjective and deceptive feelings.",
