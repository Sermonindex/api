Aeron Morgan is a Welshman, born in Aberaman in the Aberdare Valley, South Wales. Raised in a Christian home, his godly parents had a great influence on his life, and he was converted at a very early age in the local Pentecostal Mission. The assembly was truly a 'sending church,' privileged to see many go forth as missionaries, pastors, and evangelists to different parts of the world. \r\nFrom his parents, and a through steady stream of others touched by God,  brother Morgan's early life was enriched by redeemed drunkards, itinerant preachers who would stay with the Morgans when Aeron was young, ( one of whom would lead him into personal, devotional Bible studies,\"We will just study the book of Colossians this week, alright Aeron?\"), and devout Pentecostal christians of all walks of life who stamped their impression on this man of God.",
