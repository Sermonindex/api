            "description": "If you want to get engaged it is good that you pray about it. Easy to make a wrong decision when you go by your will and not God\u2019s, what you like, what looks good etc. Better to look at qualities in a girl than outside appearance. Men, pray to the Lord, don\u2019t listen to your feelings. Ralph prayed for a wife and this verse came to him. Should he take it figuratively he thought? Prayed that the right girl would be in the service. Maria sat in front of him. He knew Maria was a virtuous woman. He knew she was the right one, the one God wants him to marry.",
