It might be surprising, but we hear it in our testimonies, in our preaching, often.  And when we don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t delight ourselves in ourselves, then we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re disgusted with ourselves.  Everything revolves around this old washboard.  We have been rubbing our knuckles through now for centuries, and we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re bleeding, and the washing machine is standing in the corner because we don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know what it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll do.
