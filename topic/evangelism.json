We pray that he will be honored and the Lord glorified by this attempt to share this legacy with all who would live a life of faith that is truly pleasing to God.\r\nThere came a time when Manley believed the Lord gave him a choice of complete healing or daily healing. Manley chose daily healing because for him it was an act of faith that each day the Lord had to heal him to the point that he could get out of bed. During those years there were more confinements in the hospital, as well as trips to Europe and revivals all over the United States. He led Bible Conferences, revivals, and shared his personal testimony with others dealing with illness.",

            "description": "To pursue God's heart is to find a new value system for seeking wisdom rather than riches or your works. And scripture says \"He that winneth souls is wise\". When you are in love with Christ, it draws people to you. The joy it brings will make people around you sit up and take notice. And the joy of the Lord is your strength. Soul winning is the heart of Christ in you reaching out to the lost around you. Without intimate time alone with God you cannot be a soul winner.  You have to get close to God and be led by his Spirit.",

Stewart is married to Katherine, and they have six children. Their first love and passion is raising their children and developing their family as a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153domestic church.\" They also consider it one of the great honors of their lives to serve Church of the Resurrection, where they marvel at the move of God they have been swept up in for the last 25 years. Stewart first came to Church of the Resurrection as a Wheaton College junior on Palm Sunday, 1988. Katherine and he learned from and served under Fr. William and Anne Beasley for a decade at Resurrection. During this time Stewart completed his Master's in Theology at Wheaton College Graduate School (where he was awarded the Kenneth Kantzer prize for theology) and ministered on college campuses in Chicago with InterVarsity Christian Fellowship. The combination of Resurrection, Wheaton College, and InterVarsity provided a most dynamic training season for the ministry. Here he learned how to lead (especially in regard to vision and liturgy), how to minister in the power of the Holy Spirit, and how to read and preach God's Word and to study the teachings of the Great Tradition.\r\n\r\nAnother ministry passion of Stewart's is raising up leaders and church planters.  In September 2013, Stewart was consecrated Bishop of the Anglican Diocese of the Upper Midwest (ACNA). By the end of 2018, the Upper Midwest Diocese will have planted 35 new churches in 7 states since being formed a diocese in June 2013. He has a vision to see a Revival of Word and Sacrament infused by the Holy Spirit in the Upper Midwest.",

Pastor Bob Rogers said, \"I have served as a local pastor, Teen Challenge Director, Crusade Director for David Wilkerson, and missionary, but never during those years did I encounter an evangelist with a more life-changing message.\" It's been called \"the hottest message on the planet!\" (this is not about \"Hell\") What are you waiting for... Why do 80-90% of those making a decision for Christ fall away from the faith? What is the principle that Spurgeon, Wesley, Whitefield, etc., used to reach the lost? Why has the Church neglected it? Don't let anything stop you from listening to this incredible teaching.",

Stewart first came to Church of the Resurrection as a Wheaton College junior on Palm Sunday, 1988. Katherine and he learned from and served under Fr. William and Anne Beasley for a decade at Resurrection. During this time Stewart completed his Master's in Theology at Wheaton College Graduate School (where he was awarded the Kenneth Kantzer prize for theology) and ministered on college campuses in Chicago with InterVarsity Christian Fellowship. The combination of Resurrection, Wheaton College, and InterVarsity provided a most dynamic training season for the ministry. Here he learned how to lead (especially in regard to vision and liturgy), how to minister in the power of the Holy Spirit, and how to read and preach God's Word and to study the teachings of the Great Tradition.\r\n\r\nAnother ministry passion of Stewart's is raising up leaders and church planters.  In September 2013, Stewart was consecrated Bishop of the Anglican Diocese of the Upper Midwest (ACNA). By the end of 2018, the Upper Midwest Diocese will have planted 35 new churches in 7 states since being formed a diocese in June 2013. He has a vision to see a Revival of Word and Sacrament infused by the Holy Spirit in the Upper Midwest.",

Was a British Methodist preacher who founded The Salvation Army and became its first General (1878\u20131912). The Christian movement with a quasi-military structure and government founded in 1865 has spread from London, England to many parts of the world and is known for being one of the largest distributors of humanitarian aid. Though Booth became a prominent Methodist evangelist, he was unhappy that the annual conference of the denomination kept assigning him to a pastorate, the duties of which he had to neglect to respond to the frequent requests that he do evangelistic campaigns. At the Liverpool conference in 1861, after having spent three years at Gateshead, his request to be freed for evangelism full-time was refused yet again, and Booth resigned from the ministry of the Methodist New Connexion.\r\n\r\nThe name The Salvation Army developed from an incident in May 1878. William Booth was dictating a letter to his secretary George Scott Railton and said, \"We are a volunteer army.\" Bramwell Booth heard his father and said, \"Volunteer, I'm no volunteer, I'm a regular!\" Railton was instructed to cross out the word \"volunteer\" and substitute the word \"salvation\". The Salvation Army was modelled after the military, with its own flag (or colours) and its own music, often with Christian words to popular and folkloric tunes sung in the pubs. Booth and the other soldiers in \"God's Army\" would wear the Army's own uniform, 'putting on the armour,' for meetings and ministry work. He became the \"General\" and his other ministers were given appropriate ranks as \"officers\". Other members became \"soldiers\".",
