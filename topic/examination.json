            "description": "Taken primarily from 1 John chapter 3.  Brother Keith Daniel delivers a message every Christian needs to hear. This message is such a blessing...there is so much scripture, so much of the Word of God.  The Holy Spirit can take up His rightful place as we fall under His conviction, through the Word of God in this message...to examine ourselves.\r\nFavorite Quote: You are not saved by works....you are saved by faith, but you\u2019re not saved unless your faith works!",
