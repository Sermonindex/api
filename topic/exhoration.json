The recording quality is abit hard to hear at times but well worth the careful listen. The day of the Lord is a terrible, dreadful day, but also a hopeful day for the believer.",

            "preacher_description": "Willie Mullan (1911 - 1980)\r\nListen to freely downloadable audio sermons by the speaker Willie Mullan in mp3 format. Was a Northern Irish Evangelist. He was born in Newtownards, County Down, Ireland in 1911. In his book Tramp after God, he tells of living for more than three years as a tramp abusing alcohol and involved in crime. Willie Mullan had a religious conversion and from that time forward he decided he would strive to serve God.\r\n\r\n In 1953 Willie Mullan was called to Lurgan Baptist church, and in August of that year he commenced the work in Lurgan. One of his great accomplishments during this time was the Tuesday night Bible class. Every Tuesday night hundreds attended to hear the exposition of the Word. In 1957 William Hewitt and a team of helpers commenced the tape recordings of the Bible class. At least 1500 of these recordings remain until this day.",
