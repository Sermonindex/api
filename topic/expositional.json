A \"20th-century prophet\" many called him during his lifetime. For 31 years A.W.Tozer was pastor of Southside Alliance Church in Chicago. He was involved in the missionary alliance movement for most of his pulpit life. A.W. Tozer lived in the presence of God he saw clearly and he spoke as a prophet to the church. He sought for God's honor with the zeal of Elijah and mourned with Jeremiah at the apostasy of God's people. \r\n\r\nLeonard Ravenhill was a close friend of pastor and writer A. W. Tozer and spoke of him as one of the most influential voices in the Church in America. A.W. Tozer's materials are a mainstay in Evangelical churches in our day and he is one of the most quoted authors. He was a prophet in his day and his writings are even more influential in our day. One of his books: The Pursuit of God, has had over 1 million copies sold world-wide.",

            "description": "Israel was in a population explosion and was doubling their population about every 25 years in Egypt. This rate is about the same as current world population growth. Egyptians became worried that they would grow to big and even overtake the Egyptians. So Egyptians inflicted heavy slave labor on the children of Israel and set taskmasters over them. But they still continued to grow. Nations seem to grow well under persecution and adversity. It is same with the church that when it was under persecution it was strong but when prosperity came and it was an state accepted religion it became weak. Prosperity makes the church weak, but trials and tribulations make it strong. It was said that as soon as Jewish babies were born the mothers would whisper in their years: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Jehovah is God\u00e2\u20ac\u009d. What a responsibility for godly women to raise children with scripture so that they will not go away from Gods ways. Teaching children to memorize scripture is very important, even before you think a child can understand begin his education.",

            "description": "In Chapter ten a lot of the genealogy names really can be traced to the starting of peoples and civilizations, i.e. Chinese. Nimrod was the beginning of the false system of religion in the world. There is much of the historic church that has borrowed and used many of the characteristics of the Babylonian religion of old. The worship of stars began in the tower of Babel, and astrology was started in those days. In the days of pegleg the earth was divided, some people try and say that the actual physical separation of the continents happened in his day. But rather pegleg lived during the tower of Babel and in his day the peoples were divided into different languages and speeches. The original language in the world was possibly Hebrew, because the early names in the genealogies are Hebrew with Hebrew meanings. Babel was rebellion against Gods command to be fruitful and multiply and subdue the earth. It is possible that God could have put the message of the gospel in the heavens but whatever God does the devil always try\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s to pervert and misuse. God has placed the stars in the heavens for signs and seasons. Many of the primitive cultures had very complex language systems. It doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t matter how primitive an culture is there is an ability to communicate ideas, this fact separates man from the animal kingdom.",

It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the same in revelation of us being called to go back to our first love. God always calls us back to the first things. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a tragic day when things wane and when we start to act like those things aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t exciting as they used to be. God is working in our midst should be something of a conscious presence of every Christian. Before Sodom and Gomorrah was destroyed the Dead Sea was inhabitable by fish and animals. Now in the present day the Dead Sea does not support life but is very rich in mineral wealth. Sin can be very exciting and thrilling and pleasurable, but it eventuates in death. The path of sin leads to death. In the ancient times they counted the amount of stars in the sky, which were approximately 6000+ (which were probably stars visible to the naked eye). Shinar = Babylon. 13= the number of Satan. Which is the number of rebellion. That is why 13 is considered an unlucky number. The number 13 is a very significant number in spiritism. In the tower of Babel they used pitch, which is another word for tar (oil). One person who read his bible thought about this and assumed if they had to get tar there much be oil in that land and therefore mined for oil and became very rich in the modern days.",

It is always significant to mark the first time a new phrase or name of God is used. This is the first time also that says He is the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I AM\u00e2\u20ac\u009d the shield and great reward. It is amazing how sometimes we can rethink vivid memories and experiences; this is what happened to Abraham. He was having an flash back from the prior war with the kings of Sodom and Gomorrah, and God comforted him saying I am your shield. The first thing God says to Abraham is \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcFear not\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 when we are in right standing with God we never have to worry, God is our shield, if we have the Lord we have defense. God wants to be our protector and provider. Lord God = Adoni Jehovah. Adoni is the title of God = Lord. This name of God signifies relationship with God. Jesus = name Kurios (Lord) = title. And He believed in the Lord and God counted it for righteousness. This phrase is repeated in the New Testament many times. Our righteousness is imputed to us as we believe in the promise of God. He does not account my prayer, works, for righteousness but my belief. Paul the apostle talked of his works of the law but that never made him righteous before God.",

            "description": "Abraham pleads (intercedes) for God being just. God is always just. One of the ways Satan tries to lie to unbelievers is that how can God be just if people are suffering, etc. Abraham saw an inequity that it would not be right to judge the righteous with the wicked. But it must be remembered that Gods ways are higher then our ways and His thoughts higher to our thoughts. So therefore some things that seem to be unjust in our minds are just in the eyes of God.  When the Church is persecuted that persecution is rooted in the world and the worldly system. Jesus said that as it is in the day of lot then it will be in the days of the Son of man. Peter also shows that lot was delivered and how much more can God deliver the godly in Christ Jesus that follow Him. Hospitality is extremely important in the culture of Abraham, etc. The women did a lot of work in those days towards fixing meals etc. To sit in the gate of a city was a place of honor and Lot was there. Know them = to know them in a sexual lewd manner. For Lot to sacrifice his 2 daughters (their virginity) speaks possibly of the low regard for women. It is really through Christianity that women have been given a more elevated place in society. In Greece which was a quite cultured society women were placed just above slaves in status.",

            "description": "7 is the number of completeness. 6 is the number of man. Number 8 is the number of new beginnings. The number of Jesus is 8 all the names of Jesus is divisible by 8. The Sabbath days are a shadow of things to come, its not the substance. Jesus has become our Sabbath, we have entered into His rest. The righteousness of God is by faith by resting in Jesus and what He has done for us on the cross. It would be extremely healthy for us one day a week to relax once a week. We keep going all the time we need to stop and just rest one day a week, it would be healthy but wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t make you any more spiritual. JHVH this was the form of Gods name because of Godly reverence. YAWEH is possibly the right vowels. LORD = Elohim, Yahweh (as a name) Lord = Adoni (as a title). The earth was watered by an mist before the flood. There is no way to find out where the garden of Eden was, the whole earths form was changed during the flood and other large natural events. During the time of Pegleg the earth was divided, could that mean the earth started to change and separate? The garden of Eden appears to be somewhere in Babylon which is modern day Araq.  Life would be boring if there was nothing to do therefore God had man working in the garden of Eden to tend and care for it. Really an child of God has a true care for the nature and the world that God has created compared to even an humanist, because their humanism is based ultimately in selfishness. Dying thou shalt surely die. So it was a 2 fold death, a spiritual death and an beginning of an physical death. Where ever the gospel of God goes there is a freedom of choice and in nations and places where the gospel doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t exist there is a lose of the freedom of choice and an slavery. To make the power of choice meaningful he had to give the option and choice to disobey. This power of choice makes man something more then a robot. You could never receive meaningful love or devotion from a robot, so for our relationship to God to be meaningful there has to be choice.",

Abraham laughed first and God called Him laughter, Sarah even laughed when she heard about the child from the tent. God heard the voice of the lad, so Ishmael was praying as well as Hagar. It is interesting that God heard the prayers of Ishmael rather then Hagar. The Arabs and Israel are linked together through Abraham; Ishmael is the father of the Arabic people. The enticements for sinning are from the flesh not from God. God can test us but never will he lead us into doing a sin or sending direct temptation. By our own lusts we are drawn away and enticed. The first time the word love is used in the bible is the fatherly love, the father for the son. This is a type of Father God\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s love for His Son Jesus Christ. There are a lot of works that are done in the flesh that are going to be consumed; they will be wood, hay, and stubble. It is the motives for it, if it draws any praise and glory to ourselves then it will be your reward already. Much of what we do for God is really done for our own glory benefit or recognition. God does not recognize our works in the flesh.",

It is interesting that sometimes it takes a long time for our prayers to be answered. Sometimes are prayers are done immediately. Why does sometimes it come immediately and sometimes takes a long time. The answer is simply that God is in control of things; he is in control of the issues and timing of our prayers and needs.

When the body cannot really function or really cant work but the spirit that remains in the body is a hard thing for the person who is in the body and for the people that have to take care of him. God thinks with a for-knowledge. We cannot think in the same way as God. If we select someone we cannot ever see how the person is going to work out, but God knows the end of men. Therefore God can elect a person he has for-knowledge of so that he can fulfill his purposes. The way that Isaac asks Esau to get a savory meat was a cheap way to get a blessing, and his wife (Rebecca) knowing that Jacob would used of the Lord better then Esau. Isaac blessed Jacob instead of Esau, was it Gods will that Jacob should be blessed? Yes. Why is it that we think that God cannot do His work without us? Such is not the case; God can accomplish his purposes apart from us, and will if necessary. The work of God is never dependent on our deception (i.e. Jacob). If it is a true work of God it will be done, God is able and is not dependent on us especially on money situations. It takes abit from the romance of this story that Jacob was 75 years old when he was about to run away from his home.",

            "description": "The douri that Jacob gave for Rachel was the 7 years of labor for Laban. The 7 years only seemed like a few days to Jacob because he loved Rachel so much. In this deception of Jacob with the 2 wife\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s so we can see the deception that he showed to his father Isaac. Daniel= God is judge. Dan was the name of Jacob\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s child because he said that God had judged me. Mandrakes thought to have properties to help childbirth, they were called love apples. Men were esteemed much higher then men, if a child was born who was a girl then it was not as a big deal as if it was a boy. Most of Jacob\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s daughters are not named except for Dima. Jacob separates the flocks using his knowledge of raising animals so that his stripped and spotted would reproduce better. The Hebrew word conceive actually means to be made hot. By placing stripes before the animals made them want to conceive. Jacob noticed the countance of Laban that he was not pleased with Jacob. Then Jacob hears from the Lord to tell him to go back to the land of his fathers. Jacob calls his wife to go out to the field from the tent for him to tell them about this so they are not over heard. Jacob left with all he had without telling Laban and went off to mount Gilad, which is about 300 miles away. The best he could do with that type of large size of flocks is 15 miles a day. In reality Laban would never had let Jacob go, he would have taken everything he had. But God spoke to Laban the night before telling him not to harm Jacob.",

            "description": "The Coat of many colors came from the translation from Martin Luther; the more accurate interpretation would be sleeveless coats. It was the intention of Jacob to make Joseph a ruler and Gods dreams confirmed this to have him rule over his brothers and even his mother and father. The brothers were jealous of their younger brother. This story helps us understand the book of revelation chapter 12. There is a women who has stars over her head which is Israel not the Church. The best commentary you can ever buy on the bible is the bible its self. To interpret the women as the church strains what the church really is. Never does scripture state the church is like a pregnant women. But always as a chaste virgin so right there we already have problems to fit it into the chapter 12 scenarios. When they want to kill Joseph they still mention the dreams which they highly resented. Reuben was the older brother who was responsible for the younger boy. He told them to just throw him into the pit but he would want to save him after. They stripped him of his coat, as they stripped Jesus of the garment he had. Joseph being an ruler in Egypt speaks of Jesus being resurrected and risen with authority at the right hand of God.",

We have joy and peace in our problems because they are for our good and God can sustain and keep us during those times. Joseph\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s life typified an life of trials and tribulations but at the same time he has an inward victory knowing that God would bless him and make him prosperous over his family and lead him. Potifers wife daily was tempting Joseph to go to bed with her. Understand who he was kept him from sub coming to the temptation. It was possibly something normal to do in Egypt (world) but even though its normal for the world its our calling as a Christian to be different and follow God because of who we are in Christ. How can we who are dead in sin live any longer, Joseph says this to himself how can he do this evil deed before God with a good conscience. You need to have the reconigition of Gods presence with you all the time, we cannot sin against God willfully knowing He knows all things.",

            "description": "Where the Scriptures are silent we should be silent also. Someone had the interpretation that Even knew the serpent and that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s how the seed of Cain was formed but that is clearly conjecture and not scriptural fact. In the Old Mosaic law the offering of grain was a plausible offering to be given to God. It was the lack of faith in Cain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s offering. Sometimes the best commentary of the Old Testament is the New Testament. For example in Hebrews 11 it tells us about the situation of Cain and Abel. Just because God questions in genesis doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t mean that God doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know but rather he is trying to get Cain to confess. God knows exactly what I happening all the time but God is merciful to try and get us to confess our sins before Him. We always try to justify ourselves rather then just saying, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I am wrong\u00e2\u20ac\u009d. There was much more a purer strain of humans in the beginning therefore marrying a sister would not cause such genetic defects as it would today. Methuselah almost lived for an entire millennium. Noah\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s father still lived at the same time that Adam was living. Methuselah died in the year of the flood. Enoch broke the chain, he was a man of faith because he walked with God. He has the testimony in Hebrews that Enoch pleased God. The father says of His son, this is my beloved Son who I am well pleased with. We please God in our trusting Him. There are other records of the flood in Egypt and Babylon etc. Some of them are gross accounts of this biblical truth. But this truth shows that man has a common creation and start.",

            "description": "Pharaoh had 2 dreams and was brought before the Pharaoh. Joseph interprets the dreams not of his own ability but out of the power and ability of God. Pharaoh was surprised with the way Joseph was able to interpret the dream so he made him 2nd in charge of all of Egypt. Joseph measured and kept the wheat in special places in Egypt. After 7 years of gathering food then the 7 years of famine began. It was not a local famine but rather a large spread famine that affected many areas outside of Egypt. The brothers were commanded by their father to go down to Egypt to get food. They seemed reluctant to go peradventure they run across their brother who they sold into Egypt slave hood, so possibly they had some bad feelings still for doing this. Benjamin replaced his younger brother Joseph so Israel gave more affection to him, so he had that favored position that once was hold by Joseph. So when the brothers went to Egypt Benjamin was kept home for that reason, lest mischief befall on him.  It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s amazing to see Joseph in a place over his brothers again that they were bowing down to him. What a amazing faith Jospeh had to believe it before it came to pass those 21 years ago.",

            "description": "It is an amazing fact to realize that the Noah\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ark can be readily proven via scientific fact and findings. People have found traces of the wood from Noah\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ark on mount Arafat and the countries surrounding the findings are closed to scientific research of this nature for it will shed light on the true ownership of the Land of Israel. There are many theories surrounding all the facets of the true story of Noah and the great flood that occurred. One states that the valley where Noah lived was  flooded but if that was the fact then God could have simply told him to go over to an mountain ridge nearby or over to another valley. Also Many findings of the different coruscations of the earth and layers that occur over time show what was found on each layer, but interestingly there are trees and other objects that go through many of the layers of even so called \u00e2\u20ac\u0153millions\u00e2\u20ac\u009d of years. These inconsistencies really speak against what some scientists call fact. Chuck believes that the Noah story is not a good story to use for the proof of the rapture because God is more merciful then just saving that few. And that is a better picture of those who will be saved through the tribulation ie 140,000. And Enoch is a more better picture of the rapture of the church in Chuck\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s eyes.",

Paul the apostle says that when he came back from a heavenly vision that there are some things that he could not just write down. But we have been given human language so that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the way God is conveying Himself to us. Before the fall there was no great violent winds the climate was very moderate. At the beginning of the new civilization after the flood God said that no man should shed the blood of another man. This is the beginning of government and moral law. The way that man has kept the law is unjust but that does not go against the principle that God intuited it. The people who so strongly cry against capital punishment are for abortion, which goes against the scripture and specifically in this chapter how God is laying out moral law. The verse be fruitful and multiply is the admonition to increase and no to kill children such as abortion advocates and therefore is the opposite of Gods call in this verse. Gods covenant with the rainbow means that God will not destroy the entire earth with a flood but that does not mean there will be localized flooding. God will destroy the earth dissolving the elements, fire being the opposite then water. Saw the nakedness of his father (Noah) in the Hebrew actually means he was gazing. So Noah curses Canaan because of Ham, God knowing that Canaan would follow in the sinful and rebellious steps of His father Ham.",
