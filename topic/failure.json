Failure and misunderstanding of God's ways has lead you into the wilderness. For those of you who feel like a dry stick and have no strength, God is about to do something marvelous. The question is DO YOU SEE YOUR CALLING? Do you see that God has put the power of the resurrected Savior in the hand of the weakest of those who are called by Christ. We do not need any strength of our own, or any plan of our own, we need an obedient heart that will trust God for the power to work in and through us.",

Keep in mind, the Lord is calling us for radical commitment. There is a hindrance in us that keeps us from following God\u00e2\u20ac\u201dthat is we put our trust and hope merely in man, not Christ.
