Jesus wraps Himself in the rags of humanity and comes to us in the places of our deepest struggles, failures, and disappointments. He is willing to indwell us so He can be God to us. This Christmas, come with haste to the invitation of the Good News of Jesus Christ and you will be forgiven and given a wonderful new life.",
