            "description": "Art Katz speaks on the very important issue of loving the truth and weighing such with modern revival movements where experience is elevated beyond the truth and God it represents. He gives a prophetic cautionary word towards the Toronto blessing as a new supposed revival movement and gives Biblical truth to help us navigate these muddied waters. Do you have a love of the truth? Loving the God of truth?",

He was radically converted by reading the New Testament. God used him to have a powerful prophetic insight into the end-times and the coming suffering of the jewish people before the great accepting of Jesus as Messiah. His eschatological insight is a very needful truth to be realized in the body of Christ. \r\n\r\nArt was a prophetic voice insofar as he called his listeners to purposes in God that would affect both time and eternity, purposes that had to do with the glory of God in the Church.   Frequently, his messages called the Church to an awareness of the Last Days [End-times] in such a way that made that time seem imminent and at the door.",
