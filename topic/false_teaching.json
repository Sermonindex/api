            "description": "A critically important theology lesson designed to armor the people of God against heretics who use certain hard, obscure texts from the Bible to teach things that the Bible never says at all. In \u201cFalse Teaching on Obscure Teaching,\u201d A. W. Tozer demolishes several dark misrepresentations of First Peter 3:18-24 and 4:6, by shining upon them the brilliant light of the rest of God\u2019s Word. \u201cLet me give you a good working rule for the understanding of Scripture: if you haven\u2019t more than one verse to support it, don\u2019t teach it. Because if it isn\u2019t found in more than one verse of the Bible, the chances are it isn\u2019t found there, either.\u201d Pastor Tozer preached the 29th part of his 34-part series on First Peter in Chicago, Illinois, on June 13, 1954. Its length is 34 minutes and 43 seconds. \r\n\r\nIt is recommended that you follow along with the [url=http:\/\/www.sermonindex.net\/modules\/articles\/index.php?view=article&aid=18521]text transcription[\/url] of this sermon, as the sound quality makes listening difficult in some places.",

God promises to those that seek Him with all their hearts that He will lead them into all truth. Truth seekers are those that worship God acceptably, but we must be careful of falling into the error of by our own human minds diserning and doubting all that is of God.",
