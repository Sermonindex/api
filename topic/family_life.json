            "description": "The subject of 1 Peter 3:1-7 is no joking matter. In the home, says Dr. Tozer, \u201cthere\u2019s place for recognition of the proper relationships and positions, but there is no place for domination.\u201d \u201cThe dominating wife is a product of sin and of unbelief,\u201d the pastor declares, \u201cand has no place whatsoever in the will of God.\u201d As for the husband, there is no biblical example, anywhere, for the brutal lord who rules his home with an iron hand. Pastor Tozer bravely tackles the subject of how a woman should dress, by describing four general traits: clean, neat, modest, and appropriate. \u201cOn Wives and Their Place in Family Life\u201d is the 25th message in this 34-part study of Peter\u2019s first epistle. It was preached in Chicago, Illinois on April 4, 1954, and its length is 29 minutes and 58 seconds.",

Tozer and spoke of him as one of the most influential voices in the Church in America. A.W. Tozer's materials are a mainstay in Evangelical churches in our day and he is one of the most quoted authors. He was a prophet in his day and his writings are even more influential in our day.
