When God\u2019s people declare that we will live for the purposes of God we will experience supernatural provision. The purpose of God will always move us into the compassion of God for human need. When the church of Jesus Christ reaches out to the poor and needy in a time of famine God will give you His strength and His provision for yourself and others.",

This is not a famine of bread or a thirst for water but is a famine from the Word of the Lord. He speaks of shepherds who do not preach on sin and just preach messages to comfort people in their sins. There is a great need for burning bush preachers who have been in the presence of God and minister the Word of the Lord in a day of famine.",
