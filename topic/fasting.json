            "description": "September 1, 2009 - We are living in a church age where there is so much knowledge and teaching about Jesus. We can turn on the radio, we can quote and memorize scripture but still remain powerless to touch this generation. Why is the church powerless, and what is hindering us from affecting a lost world? This message exposes several hindrances that keep the church from making a difference in the world. It's time to come to God with an earnest prayer and ask Him to give us His heart so we can be one with Him and His purposes. Unless our revelation of Jesus translates into reality we will remain powerless!",
