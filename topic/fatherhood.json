            "description": "Drawing both from scripture and his own experience as a Christian father, Paul Washer plainly expounds the responsibilities of fathers to their own sons and daughters. Building on the foundational principle of Godly character and example, he gives practical explanations of what it means to not provoke to anger; to instruct and train; to discipline and encourage; and to recognise a child\u2019s God-given abilities. Fathers must invest in their children, he exhorts;  \u201cDon\u2019t give them things, give them you\u201d. (49 minutes)",
