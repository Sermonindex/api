Building on the foundational principle of Godly character and example, he gives practical explanations of what it means to not provoke to anger; to instruct and train; to discipline and encourage; and to recognise a child\u2019s God-given abilities. Fathers must invest in their children, he exhorts;  \u201cDon\u2019t give them things, give them you\u201d. (49 minutes)",
