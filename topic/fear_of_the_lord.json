We listen because He is the Lord and we fear Him. It is not knowledge that changes things, but a radical lifestyle. By taking the focus off ourselves we draw closer to the Lord and have a joy that surpasses all understanding.",

Not by forcing our values on them, but Christ will open their eyes if we are really following His ways. His ways are in His Word. We are to seek Him in every decision we make. What is holding you back from the commitment to follow Christ with all your heart? Surrender it all, making your life so much more joyful. This life is temporary and nothing compared to where you will spend eternity.",
