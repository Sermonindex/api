            "description": "February 1, 2009 - The fool says in his heart there is not an absolute sovereign God, and God does not have the right to govern our lives. The fool cannot see the work of God or the value of a soul. We can have all wisdom and knowledge and still reject the truth of God's Word. The wise man however, sees God above all that exists and allows His Word to begin to shape and mold the very fibers of our being. The wise man acknowledges that God chose us to display His justice and mercy in the earth so that the destitute would come to know there is a God who loves them. God's work in the earth is ALL ABOUT PEOPLE.",
