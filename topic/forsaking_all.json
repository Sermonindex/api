            "description": "The Gospel is like a Crystal, with many different colored lights shinning out of the same gem.  Some look at the Crystal and say it is green, and others say \"no its red.\"  But the mature one walks around the Crystal and says \"your both right\" It is the same with the gospel in the scriptures.  There are many different ingredients that make up the recipe of the gospel.  This series attempts to show all the ingredients of the gospel.  This is important because if our recipe is different than Gods, then we will not get the same result found in the book of Acts.",

Consider Jesus and go outside the boundaries of a scornful world, lay aside every weight and don\u2019t allow your struggles to dominate your focus. We are to stand and fight for a people who are fighting against their own salvation. It\u2019s all about people and all about those who need a Savior. Consider Jesus and go all the way with Him.",
