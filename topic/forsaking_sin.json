Undealt with sin turns life into death and turns our life into something so much other than what God planned for us. Sin knows no boundaries and drives us farther and harder than where we want to go. How do we turn from sin? We turn from sin when we return to Christ and allow a living loving God to envelope us and break the power of sin in our lives. In Christ the deepest longings of our heart are satisfied. God is calling you to come home to Him!",
