Founder of the Free Presbyterian Movement with over 100 churches world-wide and bible colleges.

These churches are clear biblical churches with a clear emphasis on preaching the Gospel of Jesus Christ and His death for sinners.\r\nIan Paisley also has been active in politics for many years and a leader of a political party. Leonard Ravenhill commented once that the Lord could have used paisley in a powerful way like Whitfield if he stayed away from politics.
