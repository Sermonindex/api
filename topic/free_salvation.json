Go search through all the religions that this world does know and has ever known, ancient and modern, and see if you can find the word come. You can't find it any more than you can find a hundred ton chunk of ice in a teacup. He says, 'Whosoever will let him come!' The invitation includes all. To those who are far away in the jungles and mountains of sin. To those who are subjected to fearful temptations is invitation. To those who are cursed by burdens is invitation. To those who have been betrayed by friends is invitation. To those who have despised the good is invitation. To those who have long delayed their soul's salvation is invitation. Come ye to the fountain! Come drink and be satisfied.\"",
