Why? This text is as fathomless as the ocean, and is the despair of devils simply because it brings out the glory of Jesus Christ. This sermon is simply gospel preaching from an old order. Hear Ravenhill as you very rarely will, and gain a much deeper and fuller understanding of the Gospel of full salvation.",
