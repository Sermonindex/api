            "description": "Every one of us should be ready to be taken by the Lord. The famous evangelist DL Moody preached at the memorial service of someone who was with him in the ministry, Philip Bliss. Bliss was an American composer, conductor and writer of hymns and wrote songs like \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Almost persuaded\u00e2\u20ac\u009d, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Wonderful words of life\u00e2\u20ac\u009d, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Let the lower lights be burning\u00e2\u20ac\u009d, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Hallelujah what a Saviour\u00e2\u20ac\u009d and the melody for \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It is well with my soul\u00e2\u20ac\u009d. Bliss and his wife died in a railroad accident. He was 38. His death was a great shock to the Christian world. Moody himself said what a disappointment it was for him. But he also said that from the time he heard that he was to take the memorial service there was just one thing running in his mind, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153therefore be ye also ready\u00e2\u20ac\u009d. When Kjell heard that u. Friedel was so sick in Switzerland he and his friends prayed for him every day that God would touch and heal him and at one point, Kjell said, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153maybe one of us will go first\u00e2\u20ac\u009d. Moody continued and challenged the audience to be ready before the close of this service. Ask yourself the question, are you ready to meet God?",
