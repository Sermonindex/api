There will be a memorial service at Times Square Church at a date yet to be determined. It will be streamed live to give an opportunity for all to participate. Pastor David Wilkerson\u2019s was a life fully given for the glory of God and souls of men. He was greatly loved and he will be greatly missed.  Our prayers are with the family and we as a church body are committed to standing with them at this time of sorrow.  - Pastor Carter Conlon",
