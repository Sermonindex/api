But for others, it may cause you to truly examine the path you are on.",

            "description": "The name of God is blasphemed among unbelievers because of the ungodly lives of those who claim to be believers but are not. Given the Apostle Paul\u2019s command to believers to test themselves, Mr Washer uses Biblical truth to destroy the concept of the \u2018Carnal Christian\u2019 and to expose the wickedness of modern evangelical methods. Men are not saved by repeating a prayer, he says; they are saved by repenting of their sin and believing the Gospel. (41 minutes)",
