Johnston lives in Memphis, Tennessee and is a fellow of the Stephen Olford Institute for Biblical Preaching.

God will either pour out His blessings in revival to defend His holy Name, or He will pour out His wrath upon mankind to avenge His holy Name. It will either be a defending or avenging to show forth His glory and remind mankind He alone is the Sovereign ruler of all.\"",
