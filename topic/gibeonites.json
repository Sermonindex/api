Satan uses masks to disguise true intentions. Let's be vigilant, walk close to God and read His word.  A powerful word that will set us free and encourage us to walk in victory with our Lord.",

Brother Jim Cymbala was called into ministry without formal training in Brooklyn, New York to pastor a small gathering. God showed him the great need of prayer and depending on the work of the Holy Spirit in the ministry. God blessed and grew the brooklyn tabernacle to a large church of thousands because of this reliance.\r\n\r\nThe burden of his ministry is to show the vital need for prayer, deependence on God and that God uses the weak and lowly to build His kingdom. He has written many books including the best-selling: \"Fresh Wind, Fresh Fire\" and his newer book \"Spirit Rising\" speaking of the neglected work of the Holy Spirit in our churches these days.",
