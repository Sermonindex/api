This Cry is simply \u2013 Lord Jesus be glorified in my life. There is an inward radiance that will be an expression of the person and character of Jesus Christ. This glory can only be imparted in us as we choose daily to die to self so that the life of Jesus could be manifested in and through us.",

He chose us in Christ and predestined us \u201caccording to the good pleasure of His will, to the praise of the glory of His grace, wherein He hath made us accepted in the Beloved.\u201d Man is a fallen creature, spiritually leprous, ignorant, and blind, but ever subject to the Most High. While man will want to remonstrate against such an assertion, it is still true. Every created thing comes under the holy and sovereign jurisdiction of \u2018The Most High God\u2019. That right He never foregoes. He is going to call all beings to account to Him. This challenging message brings out the ways in which this can be practically achieved by us.",

Aeron Morgan is a Welshman, born in Aberaman in the Aberdare Valley, South Wales. Raised in a Christian home, his godly parents had a great influence on his life, and he was converted at a very early age in the local Pentecostal Mission. The assembly was truly a 'sending church,' privileged to see many go forth as missionaries, pastors, and evangelists to different parts of the world. \r\nFrom his parents, and a through steady stream of others touched by God,  brother Morgan's early life was enriched by redeemed drunkards, itinerant preachers who would stay with the Morgans when Aeron was young, ( one of whom would lead him into personal, devotional Bible studies,\"We will just study the book of Colossians this week, alright Aeron?\"), and devout Pentecostal christians of all walks of life who stamped their impression on this man of God.",

Dr. David Platt is the pastor of The Church at Brook Hills, a congregation in Birmingham, Alabama. David\u2019s first love in ministry is disciple making\u2014teaching God\u2019s Word, mentoring others, and multiplying the gospel. \u201cI believe that God has uniquely created every one of his people to impact the world,\u201d he says. \u201cSome may count this view as idealistic, but I believe it is thoroughly biblical\u2014rooted in Psalm 67:1\u20132, yet found in Scripture from beginning to end. God is in the business of blessing his people so that his ways and his salvation might be made known among all people.\u201d To this end, David has traveled throughout the United States and around the world, teaching the Bible and training church leaders.\r\nDavid has earned two undergraduate degrees from the University of Georgia and three advanced degrees, including a doctor of philosophy from New Orleans Baptist Theological Seminary. Prior to coming to Brook Hills, he served the seminary as dean of chapel and assistant professor of expository preaching and apologetics and was on staff at Edgewater Baptist Church in New Orleans. He is the founder of Radical, a resource ministry, dedicated to serving the church in making disciples of all nations. For more resources visit the media centre on the Radical website.",
