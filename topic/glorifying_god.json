This Cry is simply \u2013 Lord Jesus be glorified in my life. There is an inward radiance that will be an expression of the person and character of Jesus Christ. This glory can only be imparted in us as we choose daily to die to self so that the life of Jesus could be manifested in and through us.",

He chose us in Christ and predestined us \u201caccording to the good pleasure of His will, to the praise of the glory of His grace, wherein He hath made us accepted in the Beloved.\u201d Man is a fallen creature, spiritually leprous, ignorant, and blind, but ever subject to the Most High. While man will want to remonstrate against such an assertion, it is still true. Every created thing comes under the holy and sovereign jurisdiction of \u2018The Most High God\u2019. That right He never foregoes. He is going to call all beings to account to Him. This challenging message brings out the ways in which this can be practically achieved by us.",

We are inclined to slip out of the place that God has ordained for us and live out our own plans. But as we surrender to His call and we begin to understand that divine life is flowing through you and you know you are exactly where you are supposed to be \u2013 you cant go no more than six paces before you stop and give God a shout of glory.",
