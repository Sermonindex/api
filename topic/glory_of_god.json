He made sure that these old men and women received the Gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ. He found this experience overwhelming through the love of his master and rejoices in that Christ can set you free from any bondage including deep hatred.\r\nScott recently returned home to Northern Ireland after a few years in Australia as an itinerant Evangelist and Pastor.The Lord has led Scott to plant a church in his home town of Portadown and Pillar Christian Church belongs to the Assemblies of God in Ireland.",

When God takes anything in hand, the end is going to be His glory. John 11 contains main factors of His ways and works. Incarnation - God becoming flesh. The method of God in redemption. The mystery of God's ways. (Providence). The farsightedness of God. We will only reach God's end only on the pathway of brokeness. True love will only come out of travail. We will only gain through loss. We will not gain anything of value unless it costs us something. The end of all God's ways is glory. There has got to be the basic and utter committal to the Lord. We shall never get beyond the point that there is no more battle for the revelation of the Lord. We must have the attitude of complete committal. Does the Lord have the mastery of your life? Is the Lord glorified in your life? Your job? Your home? Every aspect of your life? There is a sifting coming in the end. \"Judgement must begin at the House of God.\" If your priority in life is the glory of God, then God will bring you into the good of it.

            "description": "With the eyes of his heart opened, and the emotions of his heart stirred, David makes this incredible statement of intent: \u201cMy heart is fixed, O God, my heart is fixed; I will sing and give praise...\u201d It was a heart fixed in hope, in purpose, in adoration, and in tranquil rest. David rouses himself in respect of every faculty of his God-touched and God-illumined being to be in the employ of worship. THIS is his delight. He stirs himself up so that all the powers of his soul, and every talent he was endowed with, was used to set forth God\u2019s praises. His soul cannot be dormant, inactive, or silent. As in all true spiritual awakenings, it is not possible to feel God at work in your own heart and see Him at work in the Church, without it radically affecting your entire devotional life and your spiritual worship.",

On, October 17, 1971, God in His sovereignty came in revival.

This has become known as the 1971 Canadian Revival movement.",
