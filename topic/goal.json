            "description": "A true believer in Jesus Christ brings his body into subjection and exercises self control in all things that could hinder him or her to successfully climb the hill of the Lord. There is nothing worse than sin in a Christian's life that will cause him to fail. Jesus calls you to live on the mountain top. As a Christian you must live in victory over sin, the world and the devil, by God's power. If you don't, you will become like salt which has lost its saltiness. Young people who fall into sin excuse themselves that the attraction for the opposite sex is just too strong. No, in the Name of the Lord Jesus Christ, if anyone fixes their eyes on the Lord Jesus Christ, such a person will overcome and be successful. Wherever you go, if you fix your eyes on the goal, your life won't be worthless. A Christian is not allowed to sin, whether it be a small or a big sin in your own eyes.",
