It is a call to live sober, righteous and godly in this present age from whence we look for a Saviour who will redeem us from this present evil world. With love brother Wilkerson exhorts us to live holy and trusting fully in Christ.",

In the last days, Paul told Timothy that men would have \u201ca form of godliness, but denying the power thereof\u201d (2 Timothy 3:5). God wants to conform us to the image of His Son Jesus Christ, that He may live His life through us.",
