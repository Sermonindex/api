            "description": "Why should the Church be preoccupied with God's chosen people, Israel? The reason is simply because if we do not, we will be contradicting and removing from the heart of God and His prophets, the very thing that was central to Him! This was the agony as well as the ecstasy of the apostle Paul in his epistle to the Romans. He tells us that if we are ignorant of this mystery, we are in danger of becoming wise in our own conceit. In this deeply-sobering and enlightening message, Art Katz shares on the mystery and the relationship the Church has with the Jews and how we are called to be agents of Israel's restoration!",

He was radically converted by reading the New Testament. God used him to have a powerful prophetic insight into the end-times and the coming suffering of the jewish people before the great accepting of Jesus as Messiah. His eschatological insight is a very needful truth to be realized in the body of Christ. \r\n\r\nArt was a prophetic voice insofar as he called his listeners to purposes in God that would affect both time and eternity, purposes that had to do with the glory of God in the Church.   Frequently, his messages called the Church to an awareness of the Last Days [End-times] in such a way that made that time seem imminent and at the door.",
