            "description": "Why should the Church be preoccupied with God's chosen people, Israel? The reason is simply because if we do not, we will be contradicting and removing from the heart of God and His prophets, the very thing that was central to Him! This was the agony as well as the ecstasy of the apostle Paul in his epistle to the Romans. He tells us that if we are ignorant of this mystery, we are in danger of becoming wise in our own conceit. In this deeply-sobering and enlightening message, Art Katz shares on the mystery and the relationship the Church has with the Jews and how we are called to be agents of Israel's restoration!",
