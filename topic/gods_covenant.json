            "description": "May 29,2005 - God gives a warning to Israel and the same warning can be applied to us today. If you take lightly the Lord\u2019s presence and if you begin to dabble in and out of obedience and disobedience so that you develop a warped sense of what it means to walk with Him \u2013 God said He will have a quarrel with us. The scripture says that two cannot walk together unless they agree. God is not required to agree with us but we are required to agree with Him.",
