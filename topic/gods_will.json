Are you discouraged because your life isn't matching up to your original vision? This message encourages us that the Lord will finish the work that He has destined to do through you, but it doesn't have to be great in your sight. Those who win in the Kingdom of God finish the race not the way they thought they should, but knowing inside they finished what God has purposed for them to do. Those who are faithful in a few things will enter into the joy of the Lord.",

How was this servant to know who the right wife would be? There were so many possibities. Without God it was impossible. But with God it was easy. This matter is very important. If a young man makes a mistake concerning his marriage partner, it will bring him grief for the rest of his life.",
