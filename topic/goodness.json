It is in these times that we all have a choice to make. We can choose to stop trusting God because we are confronted with things we don't understand or we can fix our eyes on Jesus and believe that all things work together for the good for those who love God and are called according to His purpose. God is calling us to reflect His Goodness in the land of the living. He wants to use our lives to see that every grave looses its power off those who end up in it.",
