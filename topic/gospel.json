This shows that the gospel is not something learned in five minutes, after which we go on to \u2018deeper things\u2019. The gospel of Jesus Christ is the deepest and greatest truth in all scripture \u2013 and we still won\u2019t understand its greatness after an eternity of eternities. People are not excited about the gospel these days, because they don\u2019t know it, and they don\u2019t understand the fullness of it. Mr Washer pulls no punches: \u201cIf Jesus Christ and his gospel do not excite you, you are going to hell\u201d, he pleads, before going on to explain what he means. He argues the great need for preachers of the true gospel, and explains what it means to receive the gospel, and how we may know that we have received it. What is your motivation for coming to Jesus Christ? Security? Healing? A new Mercedes? Or do you come for salvation? But what about coming to Christ simply because he is worthy? That alone ought to be motivation enough to repent and believe. This potent and searching message ends with a sober warning of the perils of ignoring this gospel. (50 minutes)",

Dr. Billy Graham called him \"the man who most influenced my ministry.\" He was a personal confidant of Graham. Olford was also a role model and friend to prominent pastors such as Charles Stanley and Adrian Rogers. He was a pioneer in Christian television programming with his show, Encounter, in New York. His Sunday morning sermons were also broadcast around the world on radio.[1] He was the Founder and Chairman of the Board of Olford Ministries International in Memphis, Tennessee which became The Stephen Olford Center at Union University. His authorized biography, Only One Life, was written by John Philipps.\r\nIn 1953, Dr. Stephen F. Olford's years of pastoral ministry began by serving the Duke Street Baptist Church in Richmond, Surrey England (1953\u20131959) and then the Calvary Baptist Church in New York City (1959\u20131973).[1] Olford systematized his method of expository preaching and formed a curriculum used to train preachers at the Olford Institute for Biblical Preaching in Memphis, Tennessee. Pastors and scholars migrated to the institute for inspiration and instruction that often resulted in upgraded pulpit ministries.",

God used him to have a powerful prophetic insight into the end-times and the coming suffering of the jewish people before the great accepting of Jesus as Messiah. His eschatological insight is a very needful truth to be realized in the body of Christ. \r\n\r\nArt was a prophetic voice insofar as he called his listeners to purposes in God that would affect both time and eternity, purposes that had to do with the glory of God in the Church.   Frequently, his messages called the Church to an awareness of the Last Days [End-times] in such a way that made that time seem imminent and at the door.",

At the time, many local Christians believed the two brothers were appointed by God to do great works for Him.\r\nIn the many churches, conventions and camp meetings where George and Stephen Jeffreys preached in the years after this, there were reports of many miraculous healings and other acts of God. Such healings brought George to his \"foursquare\" belief that Jesus is Saviour, Healer, Baptiser and Coming King. George, along with a small group of peers, became known as the Elim Evangelistic Band in Belfast and all over Ulster. This group of people brought crowds into their large tent, and later, into the Belfast hall they acquired. Out of this, George founded his first church in Belfast in 1914, and the Elim Foursquare Gospel Alliance, as it is officially known, was born.",

For therein is the righteousness of God revealed from faith to faith: as it is written. The just shall live by faith.\" (Romans 1:16-17) The Gospel which saves us is the power of God and the wisdom of God; for no one was saved by their own power, nor their own wisdom, but by the working alone of God's mighty power. The greatest need of man is righteousness with God, but it is also his greatest impossibility. Only through the Gospel is that righteousness secured, not by the strength and will of the flesh, but by the power and wisdom and God.",

            "description": "Paul Washer uses examples from within his own denomination to reveal what is true of so many places that call themselves churches, with regard to (1) the ways in which Biblical and historical Christianity has been reduced to an impotent and empty creed, and (2) the effects of this reduction upon the people who are influenced by it. But whilst casting down false strongholds, he is also faithful to build up that which is true, clearly setting out what is the TRUE gospel of Christ, of which the Apostle was not ashamed. When that gospel is preached, we should be asking men, not \u201cDo you know you\u2019re a sinner?\u201d but \u201cHas God so worked in your heart that the sin you once loved you now hate?\u201d; not \u201cHave you made a decision?\u201d but \u201cHas God worked in your heart?\u201d; not \u201cDo you want to go to heaven?\u201d but \u201dHas God so worked in your heart that you now esteem him worthy above all things, and desire HIM?\u201d. Mr Washer includes examples of some Godly conversions, which clearly bear the fruits of  that miraculous and supernatural repentance and regeneration which are the work of God alone. (50 minutes).",
