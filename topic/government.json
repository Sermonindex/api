            "description": "True to its title, this 23rd message of A. W. Tozer\u2019s 34-part study on Peter\u2019s first epistle explores \u201cThe Christian\u2019s Relation to Government.\u201d The words of 1 Peter 2:13-16 testify that human government is of divine order. However, Dr. Tozer debunks a myth that the Bible endorses the primitive concept of \u201cdivine right\u201d rule. He explains, \u201cThe father, as the paternal source of the family, and thus as head of the family, and naturally as protector, defender, and bread winner of the family, was the first ruler.\u201d Human government thus developed from the idea of the family. Furthermore, God\u2019s Truth transcends all politics and human government. The pastor concludes with the beautiful words of Hebrews 12:22-24. The message was recorded on March 7, 1954, in Chicago, Illinois, and is 29 minutes and 42 seconds in length.",
