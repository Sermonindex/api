            "description": "Rev. 1-3 Covering the 7 Churches briefly, but with precision. This is an eye-opening message about the consequences in our lives of neglecting communion and quality time with the Lord. Each of the 7 churches was examined by a Savior who wanted to help, not hurt them. He loves his people. He wants them to make it. Let each one invite the Lord to examine their hearts as this message unfolds. Welcome the Holy Spirit and the light.",
