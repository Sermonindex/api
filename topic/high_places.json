            "description": "There is a reason why victories are so short-lived. People often make resolutions in areas that may last a day, week, or even months only to fail. The difficulty lies in our allowing high places in our lives and homes. A high place is any provision for the flesh. Careful, prayerful self-examination will reveal your high places. The world is littered with the debris of what flesh has promised but unable to provide.",

            "description": "Powerful sermon by brother Currin on the importance of dealing ruthlessly with the sin in our lives, not only driving out the actual acts of sin but also destroying the root causes of these sins, explained in this sermon as 'the high places'. The message examines the life of King Solomon and the digression of his spiritual state, warning us not to make the same mistake as he did.",
