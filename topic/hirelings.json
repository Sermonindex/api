If the revelation of Christ crucified is not in the hearts of preachers, how can they possibly impart it to the people of God, and what are they teaching in its place?",

They started Eglise Chr\u00e9tienne (Christian Church) with a group of believers in Curepipe, Mauritius, before travelling to Durban, South Africa to attended the Christian Bible Training College in 1979. They returned to Mauritius and to Eglise Chr\u00e9tienne, and as a result of evangelism meetings, several churches were opened in Mauritius, Rodrigues, Reunion and the Seychelles. With the support of the local church, Miki and his wife Audrey began traveling to Africa to share what the Lord had done in their lives and in the church. \r\nTogether with other pastors, Pastor Miki founded Church Team Ministries International in 2001 to meet the growing demand of Christians on the African continent. Today CTMI consists of a network of churches in over 29 countries, with weekly radio and TV broadcasts that cover most of the continent.

His desire to see restoration and unity in the lives of Church Leaders has continued to grow and motivate CTMI\u2019s activities.",
