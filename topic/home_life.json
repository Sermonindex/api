We catch a glimpse of the Father, the perfect gather, and how He love us. He serves as the perfect example of what it means for parents to love their children well. As we take a look at the characteristics of the perfect Father, may we follow His example in such a way that our children will see Him.",

Ministry outside of the body flows from this foundation. As goes the home, so goes the church. This will affect the souls of all of our descendants, which could be in the thousands in just three generations.",
