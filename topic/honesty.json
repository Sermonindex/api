Was evidently a prophet from God for the 20th Century. With a profound sense of the absolute sovereignty and glory of Jesus Christ, he was able to preach a message that produced conviction of sin. He maintained through all his ministry what he himself called a \"sweetheart love for the Lord Jesus,\" and it is most surely apparent in his messages.\r\n\r\nHe was an acclaimed preacher of primarily the 1940's and 1950's.About 100,000 professed faith in Christ during his decades of preaching. He was initially associated with John R.Rice in the 1940's. However,after giving a scripturally based message on John 6 Before rice and some other fundamentalist leaders he was kicked out of the Fundamentalist camp. He then went on the independent circuit. His preaching tours as an evangelist were mainly in the American south.But he also ministered in the mid-west and Canada as well.",

            "description": "Carter\u2019s main point in this message is that when people come to Christ, they come as honest people, admitting who they really are. Two of Carter\u2019s examples were people that had failed.  One was the high priest Joshua, standing before the throne of God in filthy rags had failed to build the temple.  The word picture about Joshua is a typical picture of Christ putting robes of righteousness on the sinner who comes to him.  This priest in filthy garments, who stands before the throne of God and then being given clean garments is compared to a Christian, who in the honesty of who he or she is, comes to Christ and receives garments of righteousness..  Another person of failure was Jacob at Bethel, who in being a liar, really didn\u2019t have the blessing until he admitted who he really was. In other words, when these two people came to and end of what they could do, they admitted their failings.  Carter\u2019s main text was in John 1:45, where a third example was the honest man Nathaniel.  Nathaniel recognizes who Christ is when Christ describes Nathaniel by stating that he is a man of no guile who he saw under the fig tree.  Nathaniel recognizes Christ when hearing this because he knew that Jesus was describing something that could only by said by the Messiah.",
