            "description": "The Bible says, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Examine yourselves.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d  That doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t mean that I should examine somebody else.  It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a bad, bad sign when I examine everybody else\u00e2\u20ac\u201dshows that I haven\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t seen myself, I have lost sight of my own great need.  You know, that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the mark of true Christian.  He examines himself in the presence of God and he judges no man.  Jesus was like that.  But it would be good, and it is good, and it must be good for us to examine ourselves, or to let God examine us.  \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Examine yourselves, whether ye be in the faith, whether Christ be in you.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve been sitting here praying for this one thing: that God might help in these days for us to see our great need.  What is our need?  Well, we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re a perishing lot\u00e2\u20ac\u201dperishing.  \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Woe is me.  I am undone.  I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m a man of unclean lips, and I dwell among a people of unclean lips.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d  I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m in a poisonous atmosphere.  \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Who shall deliver me from the body of this death?\u00e2\u20ac\u009d  There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no deliverance except the thing that our brother spoke of: to be made new, absolutely new.  As long as we try to fix up the old, we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll only make an awful job out of it.  But, oh, if Jesus Christ has His way, he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll go His way\u00e2\u20ac\u201dwe will go His way.  And His way is just one way: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Learn of Me.  I am meek and lowly in heart.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d  Oh, is that my desire?",
