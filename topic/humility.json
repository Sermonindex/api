            "description": "Paul distinguishes various gifts present in the church; humility is the paramount virtue in regard to the use of our gifts; we become absorbed in our gifts and consider ourselves more important than others; there is danger of being puffed up, self-assertive and overbearing; it is inconceivable for the eye to boast itself against the ear; we should recognize our mutual interdependence; men in church office are particularly liable to pride, and its extreme development is seen in the claims of the Roman Pope; the other vice in regard to gifts is a lack of sobriety, by underestimating what God has given us; this is a false modesty which draws back from discharging our service to the church; we are not to avoid the responsibility God has laid on us; God has not appointed women to office in the church, but they have other functions in the church; if an organ of the human body is not exercised it atrophies; there is affliction in Christ's body when one does not exercise his gift.",

Do not despise the day of small things. God will do great things in your life, one little thing at a time.",

From there, Pastor Conlon takes us on an incredible journey through the Old Testament and back to the New, illustrating through the Word the incredible humility this awesome God of unimaginable power has shown toward mankind. This is one of the best illustrations of the Lord Jesus Christ-it's not so much a sermon as a verbal portrait painted with love and care of our Lord that every Christian needs to hear. It will change how you deal with others and it will forever change how you see the Lord if you listen with an open and hungry heart. He goes through many Scriptures, so I'd recommend having a pencil and paper on hand.",
