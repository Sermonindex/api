            "description": "Men, have you been caught in some area of sin you can't get rid of? Dr. Logan's ministry Biblical Restoration Ministries is primarily geared towards counseling men. The greatest area of attack that satan goes for is sexual sins. Most men that come to the office for counseling are in pornography and deeper forms for sexual sins. If Satan can get a man in bondage to sin, then he has permission to attack the rest of the family. Men, this is important message for you, but one that can encourage you as Dr. Logan shares how we walk through a man through sexual forgiveness from God and then spiritual healing, and finally internal peace.",
