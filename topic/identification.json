Was a Christian author best known for his classic collection on spirituality, The Green Letters, published in 1964. Theologically, Stanford called himself Pauline and Dispensationalism. He drew upon the written ministries of William Newell, Lewis Sperry Chafer, and a number of the original Plymouth Brethren, in particular John Nelson Darby.\r\n\r\nBecause of Stanford's focus upon the doctrinal content of the Pauline Epistles, some evangelicals have erroneously identified him with hyper-dispensationalism. To address this, Stanford published numerous papers during the 1980s and 1990s clarifying the distinctive tenets of \"Pauline Dispensationalism.\" A collection of fourteen papers were collected into his 1993 book of the same name. Stanford typically signed his letters with his hallmark salutation, \"Resting in Him.\"",

Was a Christian missionary, teacher, writer, and advocate of economic development in impoverished nations. A spiritual crisis during this period\u2014as he described two decades later in what is probably his best-known recorded teaching, \"Ten Shekels and a Shirt\"--left Reidhead with the conviction that much of evangelicalism had adopted utilitarian and humanistic philosophies contradictory to Biblical teaching. The end of all being, he came to believe, was not the happiness of man, but the glorification of God. This theme would recur throughout his later teaching.\r\n\r\nSince Mr. Reidhead's death in 1992, Bible Teaching Ministries, Inc. continues under the leadership of his wife, Marjorie, and daughter, Virginia Teitt, a dedicated Board, and the many people who have donated time and talent after being changed by God\u2019s Word through this message.
