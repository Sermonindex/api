            "description": "This message was delivered at Bob Jones Univeristy and begins with Bible recitals and hymns sung by some of the girls who were saved while in Lester Rolofs homes for young people. The sin of Idolatory almost always leads into bondage, and this is where we find the children of Isreal at the start of Exodus.  Dr Rolof reveals a great turth in this story of the exodus, that it wasn't the plagues that freed the people God had chosen from bondage but the Blood. How it was only possible, and still is, only possible to be truelly free bondage by no other way than by the blood of the Lord Jesus Christ.",

            "description": "None are more likely to be worshipping a false god, than the man who is so self-deceived and \"sure\" that he is worshipping the true God. Examination of one's relationship with God thru Christ is always a blessed experience. Search your heart before God in this message, or rather ask the Lord to come by His Spirit and root out all deception that may be lingering in your heart. We want a true relationship with the God of the Bible. We want that relationship to be subjected to scrutiny and founded on the great principles of the Word of God. Know HIM and be at peace. Miss HIM and you will find unending remorse.",

            "description": "October 21, 2007 - When the church of Jesus Christ begins to portray a wrong image of God, it opens the door for uncalled and unfaithful men to take positions as spiritual leaders. The end result of standing before the wrong image of God will lead the people into a theological perspective that is based on human optimism as opposed to sacrifice and truth. The true image of God represents Jesus Christ, the Cross , His sacrifice and all that is Holy. If we are going to know the true image of God, we will be led to a place where we are undone, where everything that we thought we were has to die. We must take joyfully the spoils of all of our religious goods and come before this image of the TRUE and Holy God. It is only in the presence of Jesus Christ that we are turned from image to image by the Glory of God.",
