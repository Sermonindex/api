God chose the lowly things of this world and the despised things\u00e2\u20ac\u201dand the things that are not\u00e2\u20ac\u201dto nullify the things that are, so that no one may boast before Him.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d The question is, are we weak enough for God to call and use us? Are we empty of all the traditions of religious men so that we can learn from the Lord Himself? This is the way of the Lord. God is looking for a Gideon\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s army of those that are willing to trust fully in His power and not in any might or power of their own. God uses nobodies that will trust Him implicitly and fully. Are you going to be part of this Gideon\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s army today?",

He was radically converted by reading the New Testament. God used him to have a powerful prophetic insight into the end-times and the coming suffering of the jewish people before the great accepting of Jesus as Messiah. His eschatological insight is a very needful truth to be realized in the body of Christ. \r\n\r\nArt was a prophetic voice insofar as he called his listeners to purposes in God that would affect both time and eternity, purposes that had to do with the glory of God in the Church.   Frequently, his messages called the Church to an awareness of the Last Days [End-times] in such a way that made that time seem imminent and at the door.",
