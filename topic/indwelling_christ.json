He tells you to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153become as a little child.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d  And they all melted away and they left Him alone, and then He looked upon the twelve, and He said, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Have I not chosen you twelve, and one of you is a devil.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d  I wonder if there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a devil in this meeting.  Beloved, we meet hearts that are as hard as a rock\u00e2\u20ac\u201dChristian hearts!  Judas\u00e2\u20ac\u201ddon\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t me that Judas didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t do miracles.  Sure!  Sure, he went out with the other disciples, laid hands on the sick, anointed them, sure enough.  And yet he was a devil.  Beloved, it means something to come down and to be filled with the Holy Ghost.  It means something to be converted and to become as a little child, and only God can do it.  And that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s why I say I marvel constantly at the persistence of the Lord Jesus Christ.  In many different ways He brings the truth to us.",
