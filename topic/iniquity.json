Richard began pastoring his first church in Bulawayo in 1978. Today he is the Pastor of Selbourne Park Christian Church, which is one of the most respected multiracial churches in the country. Richard is part of a team of pastors who have been responsible for the planting of churches in both the cites and rural communities of Zimbabwe.\r\n\r\nIn 1990 these men became a part of a group of pastors within Africa who saw the need to join together in fellowship for the purposes of preaching an uncompromising gospel of Christ and Him crucified. This led to the formation of 'Church Team Ministries International', which today has been able to touch the lives of pastors and Christians across the continent of Africa, by challenging them to turn from the modern doctrines of humanism and tradition and to embrace the pure doctrines of Christ.",
