He wrote the book: 'Why Revival Tarries' which has become a classic on revival. His prophetic edge and burden made him to be respected by some and disliked by others. Yet he stayed true to God's call on his life prayed and pleading for true heaven sent revival. \r\n\r\n\"Those who know of Leonard Ravenhill recognize in him the religious specialist, the man sent from God to battle the priests of Baal on their own mountain top, to shame the careless priest at the altar, to face the false prophet, and to warn the people who are being led astray by him. \" - Tozer | \"Leonard Ravenhill was one of the few men I have ever known who was a true prophet.\" - David Wilkerson",

Brother Andrew studied at the WEC Missionary Training College in Glasgow, Scotland. \r\nIn 1967, he published the first edition of God's Smuggler, written with John and Elizabeth Sherrill. God's Smuggler tells the story of Brother Andrew's early childhood, conversion to Christianity, and adventures as a Bible-smuggler behind the Iron Curtain. It has now sold over 10 million copies in thirty-five languages. After the fall of communism in Europe, Brother Andrew shifted his focus to the Middle East and has worked to strengthen the church in the Islamic world. In the 70s he visited war-torn Lebanon several times, stating that \"global conflict in the end times will focus on Israel and its neighboring countries\".",

Among other things, he discusses how revival is primarily aimed at the Church, as opposed to the lost. This is the only time I have heard Dr. Orr talk about his multiple PhD's; surely because he is asked in the interview. This interview displays the typical humility of this extremely knowledgeable and well-traveled individual who, though he is surely one of the foremost scholars on the subject of historic revival, offers correction to the modern church, but does so in a way that it is evident he is not trying to glorify himself. The late Dr. Orr expresses his desire in this interview to see revival again, and puts forth his opinion that he does not believe that future revival is reserved for the nation of Israel only.",

He also talks about areas of the world where he believed revival was currently happening, along with some of the mistakes that people have made after revival has occurred.  \"I shudder to hear of people who claim to be filled with the Holy Spirit without any holiness of life.\" Dr. Orr talks about how after years of revival work he kept himself renewed. \"Evan Roberts once said to me 'always pray for a vision to match your faith'.\"",
