Among other things, he discusses how revival is primarily aimed at the Church, as opposed to the lost. This is the only time I have heard Dr. Orr talk about his multiple PhD's; surely because he is asked in the interview. This interview displays the typical humility of this extremely knowledgeable and well-traveled individual who, though he is surely one of the foremost scholars on the subject of historic revival, offers correction to the modern church, but does so in a way that it is evident he is not trying to glorify himself. The late Dr. Orr expresses his desire in this interview to see revival again, and puts forth his opinion that he does not believe that future revival is reserved for the nation of Israel only.",

Dr. Orr discusses how he believed that Satan was the main hindrance to people understanding revival, and though he was a revival scholar, his intent was not to increase knowledge on the subject for the sake of increasing knowledge, but rather to increase knowledge of revival to enable people to be subjects of revival. He also talks about areas of the world where he believed revival was currently happening, along with some of the mistakes that people have made after revival has occurred.  \"I shudder to hear of people who claim to be filled with the Holy Spirit without any holiness of life.\" Dr. Orr talks about how after years of revival work he kept himself renewed. \"Evan Roberts once said to me 'always pray for a vision to match your faith'.\"",
