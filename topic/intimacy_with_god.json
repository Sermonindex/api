            "description": "October 19, 2008 - In every person's heart there is a need for true intimacy. God the Father sent His Son Jesus Christ to sacrifice His life so we can have intimate access to God. We were created for intimacy with a living God. Some people go through their whole life searching to satisfy this need. Today Jesus Christ offers you this intimacy. The Bible says there is a day coming when some will stand before a Holy God only to find they let this intimacy and eternal life slip though their fingers. Sad to say in that moment you will understand how much God loved you. Today is the day of salvation, don't let it slip away.",
