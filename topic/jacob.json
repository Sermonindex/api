The blessings and warnings to Jacob's sons can be equally appropriate to us.  Reuben warns us that if we cannot rule over our own passions we cannot lead in the church.  \"Am I in God's place?\" is a good question to ask ourselves if we are secretly delighting in \u00e2\u20ac\u0153being God\u00e2\u20ac\u009d to other brothers and sisters.",
