            "description": "All life is God\u2019s Life and all Life is in the Blood. When innocent blood is spilled -- like Abel\u2019s -- it cries out to God and God hears its voice. When Jesus came to earth, the sin of man\u2019s spilling of blood ran in His holy veins. But Christ\u2019s Blood cries out to the Father in our behalf because His is the Blood of the ultimate sacrifice for our sins, not the blood of a murdered man.",
