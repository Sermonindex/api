Known for the book the \"Hiding Place\" where she smuggled Jewish people during the great World Wars under the Nazi regime. She had a vibrant faith in the Lord Jesus Christ and that showed in her love for others especially the people of Israel. She ended up going to a concentration camp where she suffered greatly and survived to share the story of faith. \r\n\r\nCorrie's faith story and testimony was shared in many settings especially in the 60-70's where she toured all across North America encouraging Christians of how to endure coming persecution. Her ministry was to encourage faith and love in the hardest circumstances.",
