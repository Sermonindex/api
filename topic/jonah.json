Upon discovering how Jonah\u2019s body would have reacted to the stomach juices of the monster, he preaches on how the signs of death were upon Jonah.   Wilder-Smith says that the marks of death upon a preacher will cause there to be a hearing on the parts of the recipients of the sermons.  The death of the cross must be seen in the preacher before his message will be heard.   We must be crucified for Christ\u2019s sake.  Even the king of Nineveh will listen to that man.",
