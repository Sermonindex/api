God has a prescribed order in the way we should seek Him and serve Him. Our seeking God has to be divinely lead and divinely influenced. When we begin to abide in Christ our lives will be put in divine order. The joy comes when we find the abiding life of Christ flowing in us and through us.",

Paul Washer said he was one of the most godly men he met in Canada.\r\n\r\nBill Mcleod had been praying and had his congregation praying for revival for years. On, October 17, 1971, God in His sovereignty came in revival. Without human means or explanation, the revival spread from church to church, community to community, city to city, and not long after from province to province. This has become known as the 1971 Canadian Revival movement.",
