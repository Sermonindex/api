            "description": "Jude is a tiny book of just 25 verses that deals with many different themes from right back in Eden and all the way up to today, the main theme of the book is apostacy, infact Dr Missler refe to Jude as 'the acts of the apostates'.  Jude shows how evil works are the result of apostacy just a James shows that true good works are the result of true faith. Interestingly the name Jude means Judas, which of course is a name synonymous with treachory and apostacy.  From the first few verses we discover that Jude was the brother of James and most likely the brother of Jesus Himself, we also find that he had originally intended to write an encouraging letter but was constrained by the Holy Spirit to exhort his bretheren to contend for the faith.  He had to do this because apostates had crept into the church of Jesus and were denying the foundational doctrines of the Lord.",

            "description": "Jude is full of allusions to events in history that he presumes his readers know all about, here is one verse that refers to Israel' rebellion against the Lord in the wilderness even though the Lord had delivered them out of Egypt in such a spectacular way and for this Israel took 38 years to make journey of only 11 days.  We see the typology associated with the wilderness wanderings, such as Israel's baptism in their corssing the Red Sea, the manna they ate was the bread of life and the Rock they drank from was Christ.  When the people loathed the bread they were attacked by snakes and had to look upon a brass serpent on a cross which Jesus Himself said was type of Him.  Dr Missler also discusses 'Kingdom Now' or 'Dominion' theology which tries to set up the Kingdom of God on earth which of course will not happen until the Lord returns.",

            "description": "This is a very stange verse in the Word of God that deals with the angels that sinned.  Satan who was originally created perfect and was the heighest created being, fell because of his pride and ambition to be worshipped like God and sit in Gods place.  Dr Missler puts forward that demons are not fallen angels as demons seem to require a host body where as angels can appear in their own bodies.  In Genesis 6 the scripture recalls a period in history when the 'sons of God' which in OT times was always translated 'angels' married human women and had monsterous children known as the Nephilim or 'fallen ones'.  He states that this was the sin of the angels that lead to them being imprissoned and probably to the flood in orer to completely destroy the monsterous offspring.  Intersting stuff.",

            "description": "Jude 9 is one of the least commented on verses of the Bible, here we find an account of the two migtiest created beings disputing over something that seems insignificant, the body of Moses.  From other scriptures we learn that Michael the archangel is almost always associated with the nation of Israel and this leads Dr Missler into the idea that the dispute was to foil the Lord's plan regarding the two witnesses in Revelation 11, as Moses is believed to be one of the witnesses as his ministry was interupted, as was Elijah's, the other witness.  Interestingly even when Michael was on a mission from the Lord doing His will, he doesn't rebuke Satan directly but rebukes him in the name of the Lord.  This is the most extreme example of not being disrespectful to dignities, a sin we we are so often guilty of.",

            "description": "The epistle of Jude is written to believers but is on the subject of apostacy, Jude lays to rest the question that as to whether apostates are saved. By saying they are soulish and natural and that do not have the Spirit, thus they are unsaved and unable to discern the truth of God.  Jude finishes his letter with an exhortation to the believers to build up their faith and ensure they remain kept in the love of God.  Jude exhorts different types of witnessing, with love and with fear, and finishes his epistle with a proclamation as to the keeping power of God, who is not only able to keep us from falling but also able to present us fautless on that final day, praise be to God.",
