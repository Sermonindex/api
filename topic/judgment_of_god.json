            "description": "This message is especially for people who are tormented by past experiences and failures.  Carter uses Mark 5, where the word speaks of the man who cuts himself, in a word picture that describes someone whose thinking can\u2019t get free from the past.  Carter also describes what Jesus has done at the cross with his death and resurrection in taking captivity captive along with Psalm 149 to describe a Christian\u2019s victory over Satan because of what Christ has done.  The sermon is titled The Written Judgment Of God because of the judgment that is written against Satan in the scriptures.  Satan no longer has the power keep a Christian in a place of defeat and cause the Christian to cut himself with thoughts because of the past.  As Jesus said, \u201cIt is finished.\u201d  These past sins have been removed as far as the East is from the West.",
