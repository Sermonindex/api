Are we living with that reality in view, that \"we all must stand at the judgment seat of Christ\"? Some of the hardest words that could possibly be used to describe man are used in the Bible, loathsome, abominable, these describe man before God apart from His grace. Hear a powerful exposition of the horrors and joys of the judgment at the great white throne and the all powerful and loving despot that sits upon it.",

A people whose main desire is to glorify God, not flesh. When there is a focus on personalities, or certain ministers, with respect of persons, this will lead to the same trouble in the church today it led to in the Corinthian church as Paul dealt with in these scriptures. Division and self promotion.",

            "description": "A deeply moving wake-up call to the church, instructing her to live in the light of eternity, \"for we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ\" (2 Corinthians 5:10). Leonard Ravenhill describes the judgment day from Scripture as a court day  where the verdict is final. He first points to the judgment of the unjust and then focusses on the judgment of the righteous. He emphasizes that we will all stand before Jesus alone and will not only be judged for what we have done, but also for what we have not done that we should have done. He denounces the worldliness of the people of God who invest their time and money as the world does - thus building on wood, hay and stubble as opposed to silver, gold and precious stones. Leonard Ravenhill strongly opposes today's \"sloppy gospel\" and \"sloppy evangelism\"  of a love with no judgment. He warns that we are passing from the mercy of the lamb to the wrath of the lamb when Jesus judges the earth and mercy will be gone forever. As the work of every human being shall be tried in the fire, many public ministries will go down in ashes. Leonard describes 95 % of believers as bound by superstition and theology. He criticizes the unjust money-making of public ministries that leads to false investments of large amounts of money. He states that we must have Jesus take the government over our lives in reality and be lost and consumed in Him. Ravenhill closes his sermon with a strong call to repentance: \"If we cannot live as a different breed of people on this earth we have no right to live here. God stamp eternity on my eyeballs.\"",
