Delivered at a conference in Devon UK.  \u201cSession 2\u201d examines the biblical lawcourt background to justification by faith.  It unpacks Romans 4 to discover the full blessings of justification by faith enjoyed by Abraham, David and millions more.  In doing so it insists on a careful, biblical use of terms to avoid confusion and error.",

            "description": "The fundamental error respecting religion is to claim acceptance with God by what we are or do; nothing is more characteristic of us by nature than to think that way; living an outwardly decent life and being a member of the church are a matter of what we are or do, and cannot bring us acceptance with God; 1) The first thing the truly blessed man thinks of is that he deserves God's damnation because of his sin; 2) the blessed man is not only conscious of his sin, but has pled for God's gracious forgiveness. 3) The blessed man trusts in a free justification; justification is much more than forgiveness, because it is more than blotting out debt and giving us a clean slate; justification means acceptance with God, giving us a positive credit, a full slate, found in the righteous obedience of Christ laid to our account.",

God will allow these trials to show us that even in the mundane we don't have the strength or the resources to do anything on our own. Sometimes faith is a gut cry out of the depths of our soul that simply says \"JESUS HELP ME!\" These storms are opportunities to remember God's faithfulness in our past and to absolutely trust Him with our future. God will take us from faith to faith when He finds a heart that simply chooses to trust Him!",
