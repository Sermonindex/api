He was born in Newtownards, County Down, Ireland in 1911. In his book Tramp after God, he tells of living for more than three years as a tramp abusing alcohol and involved in crime. Willie Mullan had a religious conversion and from that time forward he decided he would strive to serve God.\r\n\r\n In 1953 Willie Mullan was called to Lurgan Baptist church, and in August of that year he commenced the work in Lurgan. One of his great accomplishments during this time was the Tuesday night Bible class. Every Tuesday night hundreds attended to hear the exposition of the Word. In 1957 William Hewitt and a team of helpers commenced the tape recordings of the Bible class. At least 1500 of these recordings remain until this day.",

God will allow these trials to show us that even in the mundane we don't have the strength or the resources to do anything on our own. Sometimes faith is a gut cry out of the depths of our soul that simply says \"JESUS HELP ME!\" These storms are opportunities to remember God's faithfulness in our past and to absolutely trust Him with our future. God will take us from faith to faith when He finds a heart that simply chooses to trust Him!",
