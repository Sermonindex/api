            "description": "January 27, 2008 - It is time for the Church of Jesus Christ to bring honor to His name by manifesting the law of kindness. We, as a church, are called into moral and spiritual excellence through which God is glorified. The law of kindness radiates through the mouth of those who are one in heart and mind with Jesus and whose deep desire is to live a life that is conformed to the cross of Christ. When we speak with the law of kindness we take our Savior and put Him in the gates in a place of honor. Kind speech puts a crown of glory on Jesus and those around us have to take notice. What does your speech reveal to those around you?",

            "description": "November 7, 2010 - Are you in a tight or distressful place? A place where you feel hemmed in? In this time of trial the devil will come at you with the lie that your life has no purpose. Don\u2019t give in to the voice of the enemy, because you have the power of God in you, and you don\u2019t have to believe those lies. Jesus Christ went through everything you are going through and His voice is the only voice that counts. God will never allow your enemies to triumph over you. Sometimes it is as simple as hearing a Word from God. There is a point when God quiets every voice and calls you to be silent before Him so He can calm the storm. When God speaks you will have peace in your inner man. You will hear Him say, \u201cPeace be still!\u201d Keep silent before Him and let Him renew your strength.",
