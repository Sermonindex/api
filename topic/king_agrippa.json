            "description": "Beginning in Acts 26, where Paul is testifying before Festus and King Agrippa, about his conversion on the road to Damascus, Pastor Conlon contrasts the difference between the testimony meeting that will take place in hell, of those who knew, and disregarded the gospel, to the testimony meeting in heaven of those who believed and obeyed. A sobering, but stirring message that will toward the end stir every Christian to want to go home NOW. A good message for both lost and saved.",
