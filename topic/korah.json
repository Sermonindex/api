            "description": "Cain, Balaam and Korah are three Old Testament examples that Jude uses to show apostacy.  Cain was a farmer where as Abel was a shepherd, interestingly originally mankind did not eat meat till after the flood and so the sheep were most likely for sacrificial purposes.  Cain thus offered the works of his own hands which told God that His way was not good enough in Cains eyes and this was blasphemy.  Balaam was a prophet who was paid to curse Israel, but the Lord would not allow him to prophecy against His people so Balaam counselled Balak in how to get Israel to sin with the daughters of Moab.  Korah rejected the mediator between God and the people of God who was at the time Moses, this was rejection in type of the Lord Jesus, which came with penalty of Korah and all those who rebelled with him going down into Sheol alive.  From what happened to these three we see the high price of apostacy.",
