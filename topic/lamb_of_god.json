MacDonald refused to accept royalties for his books but established a fund for translating his work Believers Bible Commentary into foreign languages.\r\n\r\n   Bill will be not only be remembered for the thousands upon thousands of lives he touched through his books, teaching and many personal letters, but for his Christ-like character and gentleness, yet powerful life lived by faith in Christ. One of his most impact-ful books is the small booklet called: \"True Discipleship\" it is recommended reading for every serious disciple of Christ.",
