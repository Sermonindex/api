It is through these fiery trials that we come out with an inner strength that declares mo matter what happens the life of God in us cannot be triumphed over! The key to this kind of life is to be free of offence and to have a good conscience towards God and man and to refuse to speak evil in a difficult situation. It doesn't matter how we feel or what happens, we must always allow the Holy Spirit to lead us back in line with the truth of God's Word. Do you want to stand in the fire? Your strength comes from allowing God's Word to have the last say in every circumstance!",

He also saw God reduce Satan's empire into rubble in an instant. God saved the best wine for last. He's pouring out his spirit and those who seek his presence are feasting on wonderful things. Yet too many Christian homes are not a place where Christ's Spirit is presently manifested and God wants this to change. Only Jesus' manifest reality will melt Satan's bondage on your lost loved ones like wax. A wonderful message revealing just how God is going to deal with the enemy of our souls that will rejoice your spirit!",

In these last days there will be carpenters who look to the cross of Jesus and lead the people into the supernatural life of Christ. These carpenters will begin to rebuild the temple so that God's glory can be manifested one more time. The cry of the carpenter will be, \u201cGod raise up a testimony for Your glory one more time in these last days.\u201d",

There is an incredible joy and provision when our heart is one with the plan of God. God will be faithful and avenge us speedily of the self focus in us that hides the image of Christ.

There is a great danger of having the gifts of God without the heart of God. God is calling us to a militant love that declares, \"I AM my brother's keeper\".",

Discernment is also the ability to understand who is serving God and who is not serving God. God is calling us to return to Him, deny self and bring provision to the poor and needy, the downtrodden and those that are struggling. It's in returning to God, that we will begin to be an extension of His hand for provision and life to the poor.
