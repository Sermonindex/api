The moment the life of Christ is seen upon you and in you- you will find yourself in a trial of suffering of the mockings and anger of the rage of the unsaved attacking the Christ in you. When this happens trust God for the strength and grace to bring you through. The bible says we should rejoice exceedingly because the glory of God rests upon you.",
