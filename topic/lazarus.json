The moment the life of Christ is seen upon you and in you- you will find yourself in a trial of suffering of the mockings and anger of the rage of the unsaved attacking the Christ in you. When this happens trust God for the strength and grace to bring you through. The bible says we should rejoice exceedingly because the glory of God rests upon you.",

            "description": "There is contrast in this life between the splendor of the rich man and the poverty of Lazarus; there is also the contrast of complete reversal of condition for each man when he dies; God's tender care in the ministry of angels at death; Lazarus was brought into intimate relationship to the saints in heaven; the rich man's torments in hell were so extreme that he desired even a momentary alleviation; the condition of each man after death cannot be changed; the rich man's request that a messenger from the dead be sent to warn his brothers insinuates that God had been unjust in not giving more opportunity for repentance; but messengers from the dead would not bring us to repentance if we will not hearken to the warnings of Scripture.",
