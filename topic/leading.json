            "description": "When God spoke to Solomon He said, \" When I shut up the heavens and there is no rain or send pestilence, if My people will humble themselves and pray, I will forgive them.\" In 1966 in the USSR there was a believer. He was arrested because he was a Christian. When I went there I also had to meet in a forest like the believers had to at that time. Many Christians didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want to be in the government endorsed church. They were put on a train to northern Siberia where it is dark for six months. Many Christians died in northern Siberia from the cold. They threw him off the train so that he would die. It was very cold there and you can freeze to death. He fell into a very deep sleep. The cold caused him to want to sleep which is dangerous. Your brain can be frozen. When he woke up he said, \"What\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s happening? I feel warm.\" It was a bear from the forest. A bear is very dangerous. He found himself embraced by the bear. He said, \"Lord, you have sent a ferocious animal to help me.\" When he woke up, the bear also woke up. It ran off and returned with a packet. It had food and bread inside. He ate the bread that had butter and jam on it. He also gave some to the bear. What an amazing work of God!",

And lastly and most importantly the principle not by might nor by power but by my spirit saith the Lord.",
