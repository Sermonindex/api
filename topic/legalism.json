His books include ECPA Christian Book Award winners Spectacular Sins, What Jesus Demands from the World, Pierced by the Word, and God's Passion for His Glory, and bestsellers Don't Waste Your Life and The Passion of Jesus Christ. The evangelical organization Desiring God is named for his book Desiring God: Meditations of a Christian Hedonist (1986).\r\n\r\nIn 1980, after what he described as an \"irresistible call of the Lord to preach\", Piper became Pastor of Bethlehem Baptist Church in Minneapolis, Minnesota, where he has been ministering ever since. Piper hit the evangelical scene after the publication of his book Desiring God: Meditations of a Christian Hedonist (1986) and has continued to publish dozens of other books further articulating this theological perspective. In 1994, he founded Desiring God Ministries, which provides all of Piper's sermons and articles from the past three decades, and most of his books online free of charge, as well as offering for sale books, CDs, and DVDs and regularly hosting conferences.",

            "description": "A church filled with all sorts of extra-biblical rules is like a cup that will be clean on the outside, but inside it will be filled with dead men's bones.  Brethren can determine if they are legalists by analyzing whether there is a disparity between their church life, and their private life.  Just like Moses had to hide his face so people could not see God's glory fading, legalists will have to hide parts of their lives from others.  The solution?  The life and the liberty of the Spirit!  The ultimate test of a legalist: \"Do you love rules more than you love people, or do you love people more than you love rules?\"",
