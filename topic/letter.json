            "description": "In examiniing both books of Timothy, Paul exhorts a young and somewhat apprehensive Timothy to stand fast in the faith, and shares with Timothy what God has taught him in the ministry. Paul is aware his death is nearing, that he will be martryred for Jesus, and knows Timothy will be left to carry on the gospel. Good exhortation and counsel for present day believers.",
