            "description": "We should not be so attached to this world that we would be unwilling to be called out of this world; it is appropriate to pray that our life be prolonged so that we may labor for the interests of God's kingdom here, but something is radically wrong in our relationship to Christ if we cannot be resigned to being called out of this world; the preeminent desire of Paul was that Christ would return so that death would not be necessary at all, because it is not Christian to desire death as such; death itself is the wages of sin, and is the last enemy that will be destroyed by Christ; the disembodied state is the ideal in pagan thought, but the scriptural concept is that death will be swallowed up in the victory of the resurrection; the present body is a temporary abode, but the resurrection body is everlasting; the governing principle of Christian faith and love and hope is that we be well-pleasing to Christ; there is joy and liberty in commitment to Christ's absolute lordship.",

Yohannan says, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The more you want to become like Him the more the cross becomes tangible and painful.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d Through accepting the pain and suffering we become more like Him. Jesus Christ is calling for no less of a commitment than what He had with His Father. Jesus\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 life was based on prayer, fasting, and being in constant communion with The Father, ours should be too.",
