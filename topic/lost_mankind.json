            "description": "In this challenging message, K.P. pours out his heart for the unreached of Asia, and urges God's people to answer the call to share Christ's love with the lost and dying. If Hell is not real then God and the Bible are not either. If Hell is eternal so is heaven and those who do not know Jesus Christ will spend their eternity in hell. They will be tortured for all of eternity but they will never die. Does this bother us? As believers what are we doing to help those who do not know the good news of Christ?

            "description": "Fall in love with Jesus all over again as you hear K.P. share about the most important relationship we have in this life. What hinders us from becoming radical and having a dedicated committed heart for the Lord? K.P. Yohannan says it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the simple fact that we are just consumed with ourselves. Jesus came here knowing He was going to die. That shows how we need to embrace our sufferings. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not about dying and being beaten, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s about our heart. Are we willing to die or be persecuted for our Lord? Are we willing to do anything for Him?",
