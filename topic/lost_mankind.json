            "description": "In this challenging message, K.P. pours out his heart for the unreached of Asia, and urges God's people to answer the call to share Christ's love with the lost and dying. If Hell is not real then God and the Bible are not either. If Hell is eternal so is heaven and those who do not know Jesus Christ will spend their eternity in hell. They will be tortured for all of eternity but they will never die. Does this bother us? As believers what are we doing to help those who do not know the good news of Christ?

Niranam has immense historical significance in the tradition of Saint Thomas, a disciple of Jesus Christ who planted the first church there in AD 52.  K.P. Yohannan dedicated his life to God at a young age to serve the needy and downtrodden. He prayed, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Oh my Lord, let my heart break with the things that break Your heart\u00e2\u20ac\u009d and his life was never the same. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s his belief that one can only demonstrate God\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s love by loving people. After over four decades of selfless service, he says, I have no regrets in praying that prayer for I know God has touched millions through what He did in and through me. It is all God\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s grace.\r\n\r\nHe spent the early years of his service in North India and traveled to the remote villages sharing the love of Christ and doing charitable works.

            "description": "Fall in love with Jesus all over again as you hear K.P. share about the most important relationship we have in this life. What hinders us from becoming radical and having a dedicated committed heart for the Lord? K.P. Yohannan says it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the simple fact that we are just consumed with ourselves. Jesus came here knowing He was going to die. That shows how we need to embrace our sufferings. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not about dying and being beaten, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s about our heart. Are we willing to die or be persecuted for our Lord? Are we willing to do anything for Him?",
