The Bible says every knee will bow and every tongue will confess that Jesus Christ is Lord. Many will look for an opportunity to be saved, only to find it is too late. That is why Hell will be so tormenting. Many who refuse Christ now will come face to face with Jesus later only to find their opportunity for has passed them by! We are living in an amazing day of grace and the greatest news you can hear is that you can reach out and touch God for yourself. The condemned, cast out and defiled can press through and touch Christ. We live on the threshold of eternity every day. Bend your knee NOW. Confess Jesus as Lord NOW!

In 1983, he traveled with Dr. Stephen Olford throughout the country and had ministered on platforms with him before his Homegoing in 2004 (David was blessed to have him on his Advisory Board).\r\nSpeaking from his heart, David is deeply burdened for true revival in the church and spiritual awakening in America and the world. In God's grace and goodness, many series of meetings extends well beyond scheduled dates because God sovereignly moves in precious revival. To God be the glory!
