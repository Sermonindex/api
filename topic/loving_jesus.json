What about your old life and your friends that are not willing to follow Jesus? Are you willing to allow the Holy Spirit to search out your heart so you can break away and follow Jesus? Jesus is asking you are you willing to take the journey with Him so we can make a difference in this generation. Jesus asked Peter, \"Do you love me more than these?\". What are your \"these\"?",
