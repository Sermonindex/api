He was radically converted by reading the New Testament. God used him to have a powerful prophetic insight into the end-times and the coming suffering of the jewish people before the great accepting of Jesus as Messiah. His eschatological insight is a very needful truth to be realized in the body of Christ. \r\n\r\nArt was a prophetic voice insofar as he called his listeners to purposes in God that would affect both time and eternity, purposes that had to do with the glory of God in the Church.   Frequently, his messages called the Church to an awareness of the Last Days [End-times] in such a way that made that time seem imminent and at the door.",

The question is what if we don't like ourselves? How do we love people if we don't like ourselves.The ultimate goal of satan is to get us to loathe ourselves, knowing full well that if we hate ourselves we will never be able to love one another.What God inteneded for us is to kow who we are in Him and how much we are loved by Him so we can reach out to a fallen society with the same love that He showers upon us.",
