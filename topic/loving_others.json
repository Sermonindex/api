The question is what if we don't like ourselves? How do we love people if we don't like ourselves.The ultimate goal of satan is to get us to loathe ourselves, knowing full well that if we hate ourselves we will never be able to love one another.What God inteneded for us is to kow who we are in Him and how much we are loved by Him so we can reach out to a fallen society with the same love that He showers upon us.",

            "description": "Denny Kennesaton speaks on the subject of loving one another as Christ loved us. He shows through personal testimony and clear scriptural teaching the wonderful principle on serving others above yourself. True love is sacrifical love that will seek others before self. This is the Christ-like attitude that we need to walk in: Others first.",
