            "description": "Jesus saw Satan \u201cfall from heaven like lightening,\u201d but how could this perfect being, full of the love and goodness and truth of God take that first disastrous step down the path of sin? How could this magnificent leader in Heaven\u2019s courts break fellowship with his closest allies such as Michael and Gabriel? It began, as all such evil careers begin, with a wayward thought that gained traction. A fascinating glimpse into the life in Heaven before Lucifer\u2019s fall from grace.",
