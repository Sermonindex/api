When your spiritual output exceeds your intake. (You need daily time alone seeking God.) 3. When you study of God's Word is done exclusive to the application. (Do you articulate better than you live it?). 4. When you allow the spirit of the world to invade your life and home. (This world will be dim in a heart that is hungry for God.). 5. When you give place to the Devil.",
