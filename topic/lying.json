            "description": "When someone lies, we do not take it seriously, but God's Word says that lying lips are an abomination to the Lord. But the one who speaks truthfully is a joy to the Lord. That is why we must live truthfully at all times, to bring joy to the Most High. When Cain killed his brother, God asked him about his brother, but he answered that he was not his brother's keeper. Deception has many varieties. Lies have many shades of colour. Sometimes lies can be taken so lightly that the liar laughs afterwards about the deception.",
