            "description": "The last book of the Old Testament enlarges upon the desired qualities of leaders, such as fearing God, living uprightly, and turning people from sin.  Emphases in the book are the quality of what we offer to God, not the quantity, faithfulness in marriage relations, and raising a godly seed.  The Old Testament ends with a curse that will be lifted when Christ comes.",
