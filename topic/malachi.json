            "description": "The last book of the Old Testament enlarges upon the desired qualities of leaders, such as fearing God, living uprightly, and turning people from sin.  Emphases in the book are the quality of what we offer to God, not the quantity, faithfulness in marriage relations, and raising a godly seed.  The Old Testament ends with a curse that will be lifted when Christ comes.",

God called brother Zac Poonen to a new work early on in his Christian experience. The movement is now called Christian Fellowship Churches where the New Covenant of New Testament Christianity is clearly preached. \r\n\r\nBrother Zac Poonen has written 25 books most of them being on the deeper Christian life. Many of these have been translated into a number of languages and have been circulated widely around the world. He clearly and passionately shares the  narrow way of Christian discipleship that is neglected by so many modern preachers.",
