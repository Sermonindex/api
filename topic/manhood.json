He explains both the timing and the principles of courtship; the basis and the proceedings of it; and gives counselling regarding sexual immorality and how to avoid it. Underpinning the whole matter is a proper regard for Biblical authority in the home and the church, the very foundations laid in the first meeting. (76 minutes)",

He explains why courtship cannot be considered in isolation from the rest of family life, and goes on to focus our attention on the responsibilities of parents (principally fathers) in establishing Biblical principles in the home, such as the example of their own Godliness, teaching and discipline, and the proper submission of children to authority.

Paul Washer said he was one of the most godly men he met in Canada.\r\n\r\nBill Mcleod had been praying and had his congregation praying for revival for years. On, October 17, 1971, God in His sovereignty came in revival. Without human means or explanation, the revival spread from church to church, community to community, city to city, and not long after from province to province. This has become known as the 1971 Canadian Revival movement.",

            "description": "All men, even Christians, are so influenced by the culture we live in, that we say and do many things that are not Biblical, without even realising it. Paul Washer begins his exhortations by dealing with the speculations (AV = \u2018imaginations\u2019) which must be cast down if we are to fulfil our calling to be a biblical people. He focuses on the roles of men in particular, both in their families and their local churches, which he shows to be the two hardest places to live out a Biblical manhood. Most problems in those two areas, he says, can be traced back to men not standing on truth and not acting Biblically. Working through specific examples, he shows how the speculations of men actually fight against God, and also shows how such things should be put right. He then focuses in some detail on marriage, using Romans 8:28. Once a man discovers the true purpose of marriage, and learns what it means to love his wife as Christ loves the church, he will find both joy and rest in putting an end to his former speculations about the nature of marriage.

His eschatological insight is a very needful truth to be realized in the body of Christ. \r\n\r\nArt was a prophetic voice insofar as he called his listeners to purposes in God that would affect both time and eternity, purposes that had to do with the glory of God in the Church.   Frequently, his messages called the Church to an awareness of the Last Days [End-times] in such a way that made that time seem imminent and at the door.",
