He started to study the word of God and started to minister in many conventions including with James Robinson and Leonard Ravenhill.\r\nSome of his main Biblical burdens was to teach the whole counsel of God and to share how to be free from sin and carnality in Christian life. He clearly showed through his teachings on to recognize and have victory through Jesus Christ over the powers of darkness.",

Those who will be deceived into taking the mark of the beast will be unsatisfied with the things of God, and develop a false value system. As a result they will bring to God less than He requires of them. But those who choose to live for the will of God are promised His peace and strength. God will take us into His protective hand and nothing will harm us. God knows those who are His and we are sealed in the almighty hands of God.",
