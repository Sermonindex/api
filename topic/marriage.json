During this time Stewart completed his Master's in Theology at Wheaton College Graduate School (where he was awarded the Kenneth Kantzer prize for theology) and ministered on college campuses in Chicago with InterVarsity Christian Fellowship. The combination of Resurrection, Wheaton College, and InterVarsity provided a most dynamic training season for the ministry. Here he learned how to lead (especially in regard to vision and liturgy), how to minister in the power of the Holy Spirit, and how to read and preach God's Word and to study the teachings of the Great Tradition.\r\n\r\nAnother ministry passion of Stewart's is raising up leaders and church planters.  In September 2013, Stewart was consecrated Bishop of the Anglican Diocese of the Upper Midwest (ACNA). By the end of 2018, the Upper Midwest Diocese will have planted 35 new churches in 7 states since being formed a diocese in June 2013.
