The Sermon on the Mount picks out the fundamental qualities of our righteousness, such as being a spiritual beggar before God.  Many warnings are there against false as well as encouragements to hold on to what is true, such as publicly appreciating others.",

The kingdom of heaven is likened to humble children; to these kinds of disciples does revelation and the glory of Christ come.  Zac touches upon many precious comparisons that abound in this gospel.",
