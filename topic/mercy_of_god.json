They realised that they had sinned grievously, and were totally despondent. And then God's Word turned from judgement to mercy. Consider this carefully, for it is applicable to our day too. There are Christians who have been taken captive and live a defeated Christian life, as we read in Rom 7, \"For what I will to do, that I do not practice; but what I hate, that I do\". They realise and acknowledge their utter desperate state, and have grown despondent. God has pity and feels compassion on His people who have lost their way and acknowledge their desperate state and cry unto Him for mercy.",

            "description": "Last Sunday we looked at the first two verses of Isaiah 40. The message of God's comfort and tender mercy is promised to His people. The continuation and explanation of this grace flows naturally into the next verses. This grace and comfort is through true repentance, as this text shows. When it speaks of the \"voice of Him\" crying in the wilderness it is a direct reference to John the Baptist but is not limited to him, for it is God's own voice that declares this message which brings repentance, faith, and glory (as shown in verse 5). King Herod, in a moment of intoxication and lust promised his lover's daughter (who had eroticially danced at the wine-flowing party) \"up to half his kingdom\". Her mother, with a deep-seated hatred against John the Baptist seized the opportunity to demand his head on a platter. She hated John for openly declaring that it \"was not right for Herod to take his brother's wife\". Nevertheless, the decaptitation of John, did not silence \"the voice of Him\". Even after the death of John this voice continued to cry out; as it does even now.",

The voice of God is crying out to all His people who are in a spiritual slumber because of self seeking, soft religion. God in His mercy will prepare a trial that will lead us into a type of the sufferings of Christ. This crisis will cause us to be awakened to prayer, and in this time God will throw overboard everything that hinders us from His power. The moment we surrender and yield our life to God's purposes, His mercy will begin to flow in us and through us. The Holy Spirit will give us the courage to stand in the midst of adversity, and speak life into others around us who are perishing.",

God's mercy reaches out to the hungry, thirsty, lonely longing soul. His mercy reaches out to the fool that says in his heart there is no God. His mercy rescues those who think commerce and money satisfy the deepest longings of their souls. When God's people fully understand the tender mercies of God we will begin to cry, \"God before your judgment comes let your mercy be known again!\" God is stirring His church to stand between the living and the dead, and ask God to one more time to honor His name and save the lost.",
