A person who has the mind of Christ makes himself of no reputation and is a servant. When we delight to do God's will and we are willing to be poured out for the betterment of others God's thoughts will be revealed to us through the Holy Spirit.",

Paul Washer said he was one of the most godly men he met in Canada.\r\n\r\nBill Mcleod had been praying and had his congregation praying for revival for years. On, October 17, 1971, God in His sovereignty came in revival. Without human means or explanation, the revival spread from church to church, community to community, city to city, and not long after from province to province. This has become known as the 1971 Canadian Revival movement.",
