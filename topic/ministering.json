            "description": "Brother Paul Washer here describes something that is drastically wanting in the modern movement that calls itself Evangelicalism. There is a great need to see God-focused worship, and not man-centered humanism in the Church. We have lost our right focus on things eternal and become a Church that caters to the needs of the people. This message also is a cry for individual believers to develop a private walk with the Lord in sincerity of worship, God for God Himself.",
