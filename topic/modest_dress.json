Dean Taylor is the general editor of The Remnant of the Charity church movement. He has written a powerful book on non-resistance: A Change of Allegiance. His teachings on suffering and martyrdom are important for the body of Christ and we must learn again from our forefathers and how they suffered for Christ.\r\n\"Every day I\u00c2\u2019m more convinced that the only thing worth putting my life into is the simple, child-like acceptance of the teachings of Jesus. I believe that Jesus meant what He said. But even more, I believe that Jesus\u00c2\u2019 plan for humanity is actually a great idea! Sometimes the ways and wisdom of Jesus don\u00c2\u2019t make sense.\" - Dean Taylor",
