            "description": "Paul Washer argues that the Song Of Solomon is more than just a book about the relationship between a man and a woman, and he uses these verses to expound aspects of the church\u2019s living relationship with Christ. It is easy to learn principles about holiness, he says, but how much time do we spend in the presence of Christ? As Martin Lloyd Jones warned, our lives will become nothing but a bunch of cold principles if the presence and power of God is not in our life. (78 minutes)",
