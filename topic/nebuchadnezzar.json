            "description": "In this chapter of scripture Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, has a dream that deeply disturbs him, and calls for his wisemen to council him about it,  however he wisely also asks them to describe the dream to him then he will know that their interpretation is correct.  The wisemen couldn't answer so the king orders for all his councilers to be executed.  When the captain of the guard arrives at Daniels house, Daniel bravely asks for time to seek the God of Heaven in order to tell the king what he desires to know, the king gives him time and the Lord gives Daniel the answer, so Daniel reveals the dream and interpretation to the king. The gold head represents the Babylonian empire, the silver arms and chest represent the Medo-Persian empire, the bronze belly represents the Greek empire, the Iron legs the Roman empire and the iron and clay feet are yet to be revealed.  One thing is for sure though the Stone not cut with hands that destroys the image is the Lord Jesus whose kingdom will be established forever.",

            "description": "Daniel chapter four is unique within the Bible as it is the only portion that was written by a gentile king, and thus could almost be renamed, 'The testimony of Nebuchadnezzar' as it bears witness to what God had done in the life of this great king.  Again he has a disturbing dream and calls for his councillors and yet calls Daniel last, and how is this a type of us today, when trouble comes we go to all the ends of the earth seeking council without asking what God has to say about the situation.  In his dream he sees a great tree that provides everything that the world needs, he then sees an angelic being saying 'cut it down'. Everyone knew what this dream meant yet only Daniel probably with a heavy heart and tears in his eyes would tell the king, Daniel implured him to repent yet even through this he didn't and thus fell mightily he probably went mad and for seven years ate grass like an ox.  Interestingly in secular Babylonian history there is a seven year preiod where there were no royal decrees. This passage teaches us that if we do not humble ourselves then God will do it because He will not share His glory with anyone.",

If you have ever asked yourself, \"How can I be delivered completely from the kingdom of man?\" this message may cause you to expect Jesus Christ to work in your life in a bold way.",
