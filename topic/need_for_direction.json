At the cross you will find life and all the power of God that you will need. Secondly, begin to love your mom, wife, husband, brother and those around you. There is going to be a last days church that will come back to the cross trusting God for the power to forgive those who have wounded us. A supernatural love and care will come upon us, for those around us. In this Cross Centered Church the heart of the Father will be turned to the children and the hearts of the children to the Father.",
