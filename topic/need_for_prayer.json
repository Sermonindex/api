            "description": "This clip was taken from the end of a message spoken in America in 2005 about the Armor of God (Ephesians 6:10-18). Verwer clearly shows how the lack of holiness and church vibrancy in our day is simply that we forsook the prayer meetings 50 years ago. This is a powerful call to re-establish prayer as the utmost priority in our churche's and chrisitan life's.",
