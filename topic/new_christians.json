Was a Canadian pastor, author, and missions advocate. He founded The People's Church in Toronto in 1928. Over the course of eighty years he preached more than 12,000 sermons in 80 countries, wrote thirty-five books (with translations into 128 languages), as well as 1,200 poems, of which 100 have been set to music, including \"Deeper and Deeper\" (first line \"Into the heart of Jesus\").\r\nThe great burden of Oswald J. Smith's Christian life was to see the lost come to the Lord. He was well known for the motto: \"We talk of the Second Coming; half the world has never heard of the first.\" and \"No one has the right to hear the gospel twice, while there remains someone who has not heard it once.\"",
