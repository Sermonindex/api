The Ten Commandments that Moses brought down from the mountain revealed a God who wanted His people to be holy and righteous, and to worship Him, and Him alone. Under the New Covenant, this has not changed. Today, God still wants us to live holy and righteous lives",

We must always bear in mind that the New Covenant is not just a continuation of the Old, but the reality of what was only a symbol orforeshadowing of things to come in the Old, and a new lifestyle",
