            "description": "Tozer speaks at a Alliance Conference on the a topic of discerning whether or not a experience or new doctrine is truly from God. He outlines and gives 5-6 reasons how we can surely know if it is from God: Does it glorify Christ? does it magnify Christ? Can it be found in the Bible? Does it promote unity and love for the brethren? This is a worthwhile teaching to hear and re-listen to.",
