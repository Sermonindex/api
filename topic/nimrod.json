Brother Zac uncovers the spirit of Babylon--making plans without any consideration of God's will and desiring to rule and dominate others through soul power or money power.  \"The greatest delusion of all,\" he warns, \"is having the language of Jerusalem with the spirit of Nimrod.\"",

God called brother Zac Poonen to a new work early on in his Christian experience. The movement is now called Christian Fellowship Churches where the New Covenant of New Testament Christianity is clearly preached. \r\n\r\nBrother Zac Poonen has written 25 books most of them being on the deeper Christian life. Many of these have been translated into a number of languages and have been circulated widely around the world. He clearly and passionately shares the  narrow way of Christian discipleship that is neglected by so many modern preachers.",
