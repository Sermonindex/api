God takes interest in every single detail and is interested in each individual, not just whole groups.  Zac draws many wonderful truths from various sections, covering such practical areas as criticizing others, rebellion against authority, true and false spirituality, and many others.",

God called brother Zac Poonen to a new work early on in his Christian experience. The movement is now called Christian Fellowship Churches where the New Covenant of New Testament Christianity is clearly preached. \r\n\r\nBrother Zac Poonen has written 25 books most of them being on the deeper Christian life. Many of these have been translated into a number of languages and have been circulated widely around the world. He clearly and passionately shares the  narrow way of Christian discipleship that is neglected by so many modern preachers.",
