            "description": "September 26, 2010 - Many in the last days will be offended. The word offended means to be moved to leaning on your reasoning rather than trusting the plan that God has for your life. When difficulties and trails come you will be tempted to take another course and follow another Jesus. The key to avoid this is to have a deep abiding trust in the faithfulness of God, knowing that His ways are not our ways and He has a divine plan. Take comfort in knowing we are in hands that are much bigger than ours and we will be triumphed over. Jesus Christ promises us we will make it to the other side.",

It is easy to become offended at God when He moves in ways that we do not expect -- especially if He does not seem to be moving at all! But, our heart's cry should be to know Him.  If this is the case, we will never be offended, no matter how \"forgotten\" we feel. Even our master Jesus exclaimed many times through the gospels 'blessed is he who is not offended in me'.",
