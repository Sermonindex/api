Are you offended by Christ? We pray and doubt that God can hear us, or answer our prayers. so we have unfulfilled expectations. God responds to us, \"You are offended by the way I am bringing about my kingdom\" You have need of patience after you have done the will of the father to receive the promise. David Wilkerson says, \"I am so glad that God didn't answer my prayers in the way that I asked him! I would not be here!\"  One thing that John did well, was to take his doubts to Jesus.  Jesus reaffirmed him of who he was and pressed him further, \"...blessed is he who is not offended because of me\"",
