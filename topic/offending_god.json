            "description": "September 14, 2008 - Success in ministry is a dangerous thing if you have an unsurrendered heart. When our sin nature is mixed with the revelation of Jesus Christ we will become \"as God\" to ourselves and others. When our will and affections are set upon our fallen nature we will become an offense to Christ and we will be tempted to pursue a coarse that will lead to ruin. To be a disciple of Jesus we must be totally abandoned to the Will and Purposes of God and follow the PATHWAY that He has chose for us. It is better to follow God and lose everything than to lose God and gain everything.",
