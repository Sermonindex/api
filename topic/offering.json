            "description": "PUBLISHED ON THURSDAY, AUGUST 3RD, 1916. DELIVERED BY C. H. SPURGEON AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153And Abraham said, My son, God will provide himself a lamb for a burnt offering.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d \u00e2\u20ac\u201d Genesis 22:8. How stern the trial; how striking the triumph; how sublime, both in action and passion, was the faith of Abraham in that terrible crisis. It pleased God to try him on a very tender point. Abraham had received a great promise, on the fulfillment of which he greatly relied. Year after year elapsed, but no sign of the long-looked-for child appeared. At length old age crept over the patriarch and his wife. Still he looked steadfastly for the promise, because he believed implicitly in the Promiser. He considered not the infirmities of his own body, nor the deadness of Sarah's womb; but he waited patiently, nothing doubting that God would in due time, according to his promise, give him a son. What marvel that this son, when born, should be the object of his fondest affection! Moreover, a strange halo of hope gathers round the lad's head, for God has made him the heir of a covenant. It is in Isaac and in Isaac's seed that God will fulfill his covenant which he has made with Abraham. Nay, something more mysterious still is linked with that youth's life. It is in him that all the nations of the earth must be blessed. And now when the Lord says, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Take thy son, thine only son Isaac, whom thou lovest,\u00e2\u20ac\u009d there is a cut in every word at the most tender part of Abraham's soul.",
