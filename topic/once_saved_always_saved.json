He shows clearly why it is such a necessary and vital part of the Christian life, and what the effects and benefits of it are. In so doing, arguing always from the basis of scripture, he exposes the dangers of \u2018Hyper-Calvinism\u2019 (ie, \u2018extreme\u2019 views of the doctrines of election and predestination), which lead some to believe that things such as exhortation should not be necessary (65 minutes).",
