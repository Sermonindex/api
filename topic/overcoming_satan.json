            "description": "Is. 51 (whole chapter is covered) At the time Isaiah prophesied, Israel was enslaved by Babylon. God wanted his precious people to know that he recognized their situation. Likewise, today he's addressing every Christian who's become captive to some form of bondage. This is a powerful message of encouragement to every Christian who is fighting a battle of the mind, under attack by the enemy, who have become discouraged. God wants to deliver you.",
