            "description": "Paul Washer sets out to answer the question of where his passion comes from, and in so doing he traces a path to the holiness and extra-ordinary majesty of God as seen by Isaiah. He reveals his own love for Godly men of old, who thought great thoughts about God, and whose writings have been influential in his own life. Reading from some of their writings, as well as his own notes, he explains something of what Isaiah saw. The Apostle John shows that Isaiah saw a revelation of the Son (thereby proving his eternal deity), yet Isaiah saw only an image, reduced to what his finite capacity could receive. Holiness is so much more than we think; holiness is the highest statement which could ever be made in regard to God; it speaks of separateness and uniqueness. And what is the effect of its revelation? We are faced with our own uncleanness and nothingness in the presence of a holy God; yet at the same time a Saviour is revealed to us in his condescending love. Let all flesh be abased, that God\u2019s glory may be the more elevated. (73 minutes)",
