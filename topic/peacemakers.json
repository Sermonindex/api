            "description": "There is a reason the beatitude about peacemakers is followed by a beatitude about persecution. Those who become ministers of reconciliation often suffer painful consequences because they have identified themselves with Jesus Christ. Being a peacemaker may put Jesus\u00c2\u2019 disciples in the middle of dangerous fighting. Sometimes they even lose their lives. The disciple who has the\u00c2\u201cbeautiful attitudes\u00c2\u201d confronts people with a model of what they should be. When people in theworld are confronted with a true disciple, they can acknowledge that this is how they should live, or they can attack the disciple who is like Jesus. Very often, they do the latter.",
