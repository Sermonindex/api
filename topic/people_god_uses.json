            "description": "Chuck Smith gives three characteristics that God is looking for in people that have a desire to serve Him. God wants us to be the people of prayer, faith, and not seeking glory for ourselves, but to give glory to our Lord Jesus Christ.  Chuck reminds us that God has to prepare a vessel first for the work that He already ordained that should be accomplished for Him.  God first must work in us before He can work through us.",

            "description": "Chuck Smith continues his series on people used by God with focus on faith.  In Hebrews 11:6 we read that without faith it is impossible to please God for he who comes to God must believe that He is and He rewards those that truly seek Him.  The men and women that God uses believe in His promises and stand in faith upon those promises.  Paul reminds us in the Epistle to Romans that it is God who gives us a measure of faith (Romans 12:3).  The men and women that God uses are people of faith.",
