            "description": "This message was delivered on 07\/08\/1969 at the Atlantic States Christian Convocation (Wabanna) 1969. It is very important for the people of God to know the meaning of the times in which we live. God is always moving forward but He is having to bring His people back from where they have deviated from His intention and plan. Man never really learns anything theoretically. Man really learns anything only by experience. Everything in Christianity depends on the meaning of Jesus Christ. The main thing is a revelation of a Person inwardly. God reveals His Son \"in us\".",
