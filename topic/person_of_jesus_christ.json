            "description": "This message was delivered on 07\/08\/1969 at the Atlantic States Christian Convocation (Wabanna) 1969. It is very important for the people of God to know the meaning of the times in which we live. God is always moving forward but He is having to bring His people back from where they have deviated from His intention and plan. Man never really learns anything theoretically. Man really learns anything only by experience. Everything in Christianity depends on the meaning of Jesus Christ. The main thing is a revelation of a Person inwardly. God reveals His Son \"in us\".",

He was ordained as a Baptist pastor at the age of 24, and from 1912 to 1926 led three congregations in Greater London. During these years, he was also closely related to Jessie Penn-Lewis and her publication and speaking ministry, the \"Overcomer Testimony.\"\r\n\r\nAmong the many books that he wrote, at least three are regarded as Christian classics: The School of Christ, The Centrality and Supremacy of the Lord Jesus Christ and We Beheld His Glory. The primary theme of Sparks' books is the exaltation of the Lord Jesus Christ. He mentored Watchman Nee for many years and was very influential in his understanding of the Church Life.",
