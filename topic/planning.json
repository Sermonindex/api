She was used of the Lord to help found the Evangelical Sisterhood of Mary. The Lord has used her writings powerfully to help encourage the greater body of Christ of future sufferings for the Lord and how to endure them. Also one of the burdens of her ministry was to share in the sufferings of the Lord and share the sorrow that Jesus has for a lost world and a backslidden church.\r\n\r\n\"In heaven we will say, \u2018Do you remember the time we celebrated a festival of heaven on earth with Mother Basilea?'\" - Corrie ten Boom. \"To visit one of the Kanaan sanctuaries that they have assembled around the world is to visit a taste of the kingdom on earth.\" - Greg Gordon",
