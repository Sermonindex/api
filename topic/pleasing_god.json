Yet he stayed true to God's call on his life prayed and pleading for true heaven sent revival. \r\n\r\n\"Those who know of Leonard Ravenhill recognize in him the religious specialist, the man sent from God to battle the priests of Baal on their own mountain top, to shame the careless priest at the altar, to face the false prophet, and to warn the people who are being led astray by him. \" - Tozer | \"Leonard Ravenhill was one of the few men I have ever known who was a true prophet.\" - David Wilkerson",

            "description": "This message caused some to shrink back at the sovereign severity of God.  Is the kingdom of heaven worth giving all or not?  Some seemed to shrink back from the assertion that God will only allow into His eternal rest those who He found pleasing to Himself.  This message speaks of the biblical aspect of personal responsibility to search out, receive wisdom, and walk worthy of the calling we have received.  There seems to be a voice out there that raises the question, \" but isn't there a place in heaven for the less than full hearted?\"  It seems that some have forgotten the \"evil\" of willful neglect, and humanized the love of God down to the degraded level of a loving grandpa who although might be disappointed with our lack of progress, never really had any intention of rejecting any of those who made some kind of attempt to do what is right.  It frightens me when I consider the stark reality that awaits countless multitudes who will awake to an eternal separation from God and see their self deluded dream of heaven vanish into the flaming judgment of Hell.  They will be shocked that their self created fantasy of what an acceptable walk with God so utterly deceived themselves.",
