The Bible says in the last days the devil will come down on humankind having great wrath, because he knows he has a short time. Will this mad devil meet a passive, lame church? Will he find a faithless people who name the name of Christ but don't resist their enemy by the power in that holy name? We don't have to take what the devil is dishing out. This message will help build up your most holy faith.",
