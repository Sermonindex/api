He wants us not living on bread (prosperity) promises alone, but by every promise in the Word of God.

And they will reap wonderful rewards of joy and peace in their God. We need to actively seek God, wanting his ways and thoughts over our own to become so intimate with him that we know his heart and share it. Then we will love what he loves and hate what he hates.
