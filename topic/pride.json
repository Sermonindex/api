Jim Logan will share how when I am living with pride in my life, not only as I sinning against God, but I am standing with the enemy. Pride is sometime as simple as the centering life all about me. Do you have pride in your life? Are there areas of your life not under the control of God? If so, this message is for you!",

Humility is the opposite of self-centred pride. If you are humble, you consider yourself the servant of others. You do not feel or act superior to others and you are not a respecter of persons.",

We know we are operating under a spirit of pride when we become corrupted by how we see ourselves and begin to form false images. Prideful people are highly offended when God challenges this image. They refuse to die to reputation and are easily offended when confronted by Godly people.",
