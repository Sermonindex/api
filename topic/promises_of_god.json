When God speaks and makes a decree He speaks by His Living Word and He is Bound to His own promises and divine purposes. We cannot go into God's presence without a promise from His Word. When God speaks a word to you don't consult with your flesh and don't allow your feelings of unworthiness to effect your prayers. We are to come boldly with a fixed position, believing the truth and power of His Word. We do not try to persuade God, but rather are fully persuaded with a fixed position to the faithfulness of His Word.",

The very testimony of Christ in us will be a voice crying out to them. We as children of God are to take the promises of God and begin to speak what God is speaking to us about this lost generation. We are to allow the word of God\u2019s promises become a higher reality than every situation and pour the water of life on the dry land and this life flowing force will lead the lost to the Blood of Jesus and the finished work of Calvary.",

We may hold on to relationships, plans, dreams and\/or a set of goals. Many times these are the very things that are hindering us from the supernatural plan that God has for our lives. This message provokes us to have a direct confrontation with these things and a mindset that says this thing needs to go! As we begin to let go God will begin to take us into the blessings that were already promised to us. The rest comes when we simply agree with God in every area of our life.",
