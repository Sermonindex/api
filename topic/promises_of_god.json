Now internationally, wherever people really desire a change and are willing to conform to God's condition to 'humble themselves', God is visiting and changing people of various religions and backgrounds. Instead of 'intellectual bat-chasing in the dark' which men oft-times call religion today, people are meeting the Lord Jesus and God is speaking to men and women. They have television, radio and website broadcasts today that are touching thousands with the life-changing Gospel.",
