            "description": "When we look at the state of the Church today, I am sure that many Christians are saddened by what they see. In many ways, there is little difference between the behaviour of 21st century believers and what went on with the people of Israel during the time of Jeremiah and the other Old Testament prophets. It seems that, once again, God\u2019s people are being led to run after things that do not profit them.",

The question is, \u201cWhat do we do with this cup of salvation\u201d? This message points to examples in history where people were given a great opportunity to serve God but became self indulgent. The self indulgent church has nothing in his heart for his brother. It gravitates to the things of the world and its possessions, instead of living for Christ. There is a final warning to the self indulgent church to turn away from their sins and become charitable to the poor. There is a time when a sentence is written against those who were supposed to be a testimony in the earth. Recognizing and honoring truth is not enough, we must embrace it and walk it out! In one minute everything can change and only those who have the compassion of God for humanity will stand!",

He absolutely will not let His people pursue a path that will lead to hell. God is calling His church to return to Him and allow Him to take away all the iniquity in us that would keep His life from flowing through His Body. When we get right with God the storms will come but His church will stand with His Glory upon us. The testimony of the true church of Christ will not be shaken!",
