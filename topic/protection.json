At the time Jeremiah gave this word there were also other false prophets saying that it would go bad with them in exile. But they were false prophets. Jeremiah told them to be obedient and God would be with them and give them a hope and a future in the foreign godless country. So they went into exile and found it to be a godless nation. But God rose up mighty men of God like Daniel, Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego. And they shook that nation through their lives and testimony and God's Word spread through that nation through their testimony. Not that they didn't meet up with difficulties, but as they remained faithful to God He delivered them and through it glorified God.",
