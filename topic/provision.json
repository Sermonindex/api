The question is what are we asking for? We are called to be a testimony of Jesus Christ in the earth. The light and life of Christ is given to those who are given for the purposes of God. Ask for your heart to be broken for the lost. Ask for the strength to take up your cross and follow Jesus. We are to seek first His kingdom. Seek the heart and the will of God and He promises that all we need will be given to us and at the end of the day we will have joy!",

Many turn back right at the place where they will begin to discover and enter into the supernatural life of God. When we are in unbelief we begin to limit God by doubting that He could supply what we need and take us where He is calling us to go. The central core of unbelief is that God's way is incomplete and we must help Him bring His plan to pass. If you are sitting in unbelief, remove yourself from that place and grab on to the promises of God. We must learn how to trust God for strength and provision. Don't pray to get out of the situation, pray that you may find supernatural life in it. God is looking for people who have come through the wilderness with a voice of triumph to speak to the next generation. Do you believe that God CAN, or will you limit the Holy One of Israel?",

The Lord is calling His church to rise up and take courage and trust God. He will begin to fill us with His grace and peace. God in these last days wants to give us an understanding of His love to keep us standing strong and secure .",

Before God can use us and pour His provision through us He must see a core value in our character. We must have the same compassion that Christ has for us. True compassion is born of the Spirit. The storehouse of God is unlocked when the Holy Spirit stirs us to reach out to the sea of human need all around us.",
