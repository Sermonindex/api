            "description": "\u201cSeeing Ye Have Purified Your Souls\u201d is part 17 of Pastor A. W. Tozer\u2019s delightful, 34-part series based upon 1 Peter. The message was preached in Chicago, Illinois on January 17, 1954. Pastor Tozer notes that 1 Peter 1:22 is perfect for a sermon, as it may be conveniently divided into 7 parts: 1) You have purified your souls; 2) By obeying the truth; 3) Through the Spirit; 4) Unto unfeigned love of the brethren; 5) See therefore that ye love one another; 6) Out of a pure heart; 7) Fervently. He also teaches quick but important refresher courses in homiletics, comparative religion, and apologetics (from Hebrews 11.) The length of the recording is 31 minutes and 36 seconds.",

A \"20th-century prophet\" many called him during his lifetime. For 31 years A.W.Tozer was pastor of Southside Alliance Church in Chicago. He was involved in the missionary alliance movement for most of his pulpit life. A.W. Tozer lived in the presence of God he saw clearly and he spoke as a prophet to the church. He sought for God's honor with the zeal of Elijah and mourned with Jeremiah at the apostasy of God's people. \r\n\r\nLeonard Ravenhill was a close friend of pastor and writer A. W. Tozer and spoke of him as one of the most influential voices in the Church in America. A.W. Tozer's materials are a mainstay in Evangelical churches in our day and he is one of the most quoted authors. He was a prophet in his day and his writings are even more influential in our day. One of his books: The Pursuit of God, has had over 1 million copies sold world-wide.",
