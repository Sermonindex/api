            "description": "Pastor Wayne talks on the need in our busy culture to set aside time to meet with God in quiet. This requires discipline as he states and we need to practice this in our daily lives. This requires trust that God will meet you with that time of waiting that you sacrifice to do. Prayer is not only speaking to God but listening to God.",
