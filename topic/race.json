            "description": "The Apostle Paul addressed this letter to the Corinthians. Corinth was a business centre in Greece. Paul preached the gospel there and it was wonderful. Then he left to continue his journey, travelling the world and planting churches. He didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t forget those who were left behind. He kept writing letters to them. He always remembered them in prayer, urging them to continue in the Lord\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s work. He desired that each one would go forward to achieve the goal. Sometimes he disciplined them and sometimes he strengthened and comforted them.",
