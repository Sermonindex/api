            "description": "As an international Speaker, Ken Ham points out how in America, unlike any other nation on the planet, there is a unique problem with racism.  Specifically he objects to the prejudice and racism of \u2018Christians,\u2019 and Americans in general who have adopted petty ideas about it from evolutionary history and cults. He shows through the Bible, and genetics, how we are all in fact just one race, and that is the \u2018race,\u2019 of Adam.  He says that people who preach that it is wrong to marry inter-racially are simply not preaching a biblical ideal and need to repent.  He shows how a belief in Evolution promotes racism and prejudice, and how the only form of inter-racial marriage to be concerned about is when a child born of the \u2018Last Adam,\u2019 marries a child only born of the \u2018First Adam.\u2019",
