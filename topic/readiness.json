            "description": "This is a chilling message which should awake and shake anyone who listens to it prayerfully. Much of the church is fast asleep as the foolish virgins with no oil were, in Matt. 25. How do you know if you are ready? Get your eyes on Jesus, focus on his purposes for your life, not the things of this world, (Col 3:1-3), Stay in the Word daily; seeking him, for how shall you escape if you neglect so great a salvation? (Heb. 2:3). Settle every grudge, forgive those who have hurt you and don't be a smiter or unbeliever!\u00a0If you really BELIEVE he's coming, does your life reflect that? Or are you at ease in Zion? Pray before you listen to this, and while you listen to this, for the Holy Spirit to shed his Light in your heart.",
