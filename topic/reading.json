            "description": "Though not the actual voice of the great evangelist, this sermon is well read and worth the listen. The reader does an excellent job preserving the heart of Moody in the delivery. Taken from Daniel 5, the story of the finger writing on the wall 'Mene Mene Tekel Parsin', Moody expounds on how we will all be weighed in the balance of God's Ten Commandments, and our position in Christ will define the outcome. This is a solid sermon revealing further insight into the style and message of the late D.L. Moody.",
