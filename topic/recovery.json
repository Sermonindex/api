We must get our eyes off of man and onto Christ. The ministry of John is the ministry of life. 1. The key to recovery is to return to that which ministers life. Whatever minisers life is of God. That which ministers death is of self.  2. Recovery means turning back to Christ, who is the life.  3. There is a vast difference in eating of the fruit of the tree of life (Christ) and eating of the fruit of the knowledge of good and evil, that leads to death.",
