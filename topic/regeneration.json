He was born in Newtownards, County Down, Ireland in 1911. In his book Tramp after God, he tells of living for more than three years as a tramp abusing alcohol and involved in crime. Willie Mullan had a religious conversion and from that time forward he decided he would strive to serve God.\r\n\r\n In 1953 Willie Mullan was called to Lurgan Baptist church, and in August of that year he commenced the work in Lurgan. One of his great accomplishments during this time was the Tuesday night Bible class. Every Tuesday night hundreds attended to hear the exposition of the Word. In 1957 William Hewitt and a team of helpers commenced the tape recordings of the Bible class. At least 1500 of these recordings remain until this day.",

This urgent message is a Biblical exposition of salvation and regeneration, which also defends both the honour of God and the unity of the true church. Men and women are going to hell for want of the preaching of this message, he says. It's no wonder, then, that he speaks with such passion.  (96 minutes)",

So says Paul Washer as he expounds the realities of regeneration, and what it means to be crucified with Christ, dead to sin, and alive unto God. With customary passion he contrasts the natures of people before and after conversion, and shows how the truths of Romans 6 empower believers to live according to Romans 12  (55 minutes).",
