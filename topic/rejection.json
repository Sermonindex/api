He was born in Newtownards, County Down, Ireland in 1911. In his book Tramp after God, he tells of living for more than three years as a tramp abusing alcohol and involved in crime. Willie Mullan had a religious conversion and from that time forward he decided he would strive to serve God.\r\n\r\n In 1953 Willie Mullan was called to Lurgan Baptist church, and in August of that year he commenced the work in Lurgan. One of his great accomplishments during this time was the Tuesday night Bible class. Every Tuesday night hundreds attended to hear the exposition of the Word. In 1957 William Hewitt and a team of helpers commenced the tape recordings of the Bible class. At least 1500 of these recordings remain until this day.",

            "description": "When the Holy Spirit convicts you of something needing changing, and guilt and condemnation set in, and aware of your own struggle, you fear the Lord is tired of your failures and has rejected you. Because of past wounds in their lives, some fear God will reject them as people sometimes have. You can determine to live a new life in Christ, secure and have the assurance you so desperately need. When the Word comes and voices arise to condemn you, you can shoot them down (Is. 54:17). God loves you enough to not let you by with sin that will destroy you. Come to him for cleansing, forgiveness, and peace and rest.",
