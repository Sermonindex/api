            "description": "This is the final of a four-part series outlining a \"Blueprint For Battle\" from the life of Jehoshaphat. As we saw the enemy bearing down upon Israel, we saw Jehoshaphat pray, surrendering his will to God's. We saw him stand in the midst of battle and watch to see what God would do. This lesson is about what to do when God has handed us even the smallest of victories. We need to stop and praise Him as God gives us rest. It may be for only a day or a long while, but it is imperative that we take the holiday with Him.",

            "description": "It would be awful to go before the Lord with a barren place in our heart and life, an area not touched yet by the Lord where we do not have victory. Yet that is exactly what Hannah did, in spite of the fact she was provoked sore by her adversary, and mocked for her barrenness. The enemy will come and lie to you accusing you, telling you God sees your flaws and has withdrawn from you. Hannah began to fast and pray, so desperate for God to birth something in her that she was willing to give it back to him if he would. And he did. We can appropriate this lesson for our own lives. And we will find the way to the rejoicing heart, just as Hannah did.",
