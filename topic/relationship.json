Christ is the most wonderful subject to dwell on, to think about, to meditate on.  Do I love Him?

Oh, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153the love of Jesus, what it is, none but His loved ones know.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d  But the Bible, the New Testament, says such marvelous things about the love of Jesus.  \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Do I love You, Jesus?  Has the Holy Ghost been able to reveal to me the love of God?  Has He been able to set my heart on fire with the love of God?\u00e2\u20ac\u009d",
