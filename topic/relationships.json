But those who have Jesus\u00c2\u2019 attitude of mercy are to show it; not to do so will affect our private worship. We must make sure we are not alienated from anyone who Jesus calls our \u00c2\u201cbrother.\u00c2\u201d Anger and feelings of disgust toward our brothers and sisters must be addressed if we want to have a relationship with them that ispleasing to God.",
