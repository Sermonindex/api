The very heart of satan finds refuge in religion and causes false teachers and false prophets to be moved outside of the true works of God. These types of preachers make their way into pulpits and bow down to the worship and agenda of man. When worship is true worship the voice of God is immediately heard. Wisdom is found of God as we lay down our treasures at His feet with no agenda of personal gain. True worship is content in seeking the likeness of Christ and is surrendered totally to His purposes.",

He doesn't want this dirt on his hands because it offends his religion. The fruit of this religion that does not have the heart of God in it is a cold formality and a skepticism. When was the last time you raised up your hands to God and thanked Him for what He has done in your life and His faithfulness? Tears of gratitude refresh Jesus. These tears come from a genuine work of God and a worship that remembers where He brought us from and that He is the source of my work.",
