Brother Zac stirs you to go beyond being satisfied with so little, when God has promised rivers of living water to flow out of you to be a blessing to everyone you meet.  \"If you're satisfied with something less than God's highest, then that's all you'll have.\"",

Brother Zac contrasts these two streams--religiosity vs. spirituality--as it threads its way through the Bible, starting with Cain and Abel, to the Pharisees and Jesus, to the end times in Revelation with Babylon and Jerusalem.  Externally these can appear so similar, but the underlying spirit is as different as heaven is from hell.",
