He was born in Newtownards, County Down, Ireland in 1911. In his book Tramp after God, he tells of living for more than three years as a tramp abusing alcohol and involved in crime. Willie Mullan had a religious conversion and from that time forward he decided he would strive to serve God.\r\n\r\n In 1953 Willie Mullan was called to Lurgan Baptist church, and in August of that year he commenced the work in Lurgan. One of his great accomplishments during this time was the Tuesday night Bible class. Every Tuesday night hundreds attended to hear the exposition of the Word. In 1957 William Hewitt and a team of helpers commenced the tape recordings of the Bible class. At least 1500 of these recordings remain until this day.",

And people laid hold of it all over the place.  And I think before I got through preaching, many were filled with the Holy Ghost, and many got up, one by one, and testified that they had been healed of the most unbelievable diseases.  Cancer, and other terrible things fled before the memory\u00e2\u20ac\u201dthe remembrance\u00e2\u20ac\u201d\u00e2\u20ac\u0153Forget not all His benefits.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d  Forget not all that He has done for you on Calvary\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s cross.  I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m so glad that Jesus Christ instituted this communion service for all of us.  And He told us to remember Him until He comes.  When He comes, we won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t need it anymore because then we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll have Him in person.  Then \u00e2\u20ac\u0153we shall look upon Him as He is,\u00e2\u20ac\u009d and then we shall forever be united to Him.
