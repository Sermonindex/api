And how many times we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve had wonderful meetings when we were reminded of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153all His benefits\u00e2\u20ac\u009d: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Who forgiveth all thine iniquities, Who healeth all thy diseases.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d  I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m reminded now of a meeting in Stuttgart, in Zuffenhausen, where we had a communion service, and the Lord gave me a short message on that text from Psalm 103.  And people laid hold of it all over the place.  And I think before I got through preaching, many were filled with the Holy Ghost, and many got up, one by one, and testified that they had been healed of the most unbelievable diseases.  Cancer, and other terrible things fled before the memory\u00e2\u20ac\u201dthe remembrance\u00e2\u20ac\u201d\u00e2\u20ac\u0153Forget not all His benefits.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d  Forget not all that He has done for you on Calvary\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s cross.  I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m so glad that Jesus Christ instituted this communion service for all of us.  And He told us to remember Him until He comes.  When He comes, we won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t need it anymore because then we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll have Him in person.  Then \u00e2\u20ac\u0153we shall look upon Him as He is,\u00e2\u20ac\u009d and then we shall forever be united to Him.  And so, we love to be reminded of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153all His benefits.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d",

The question is, \"What is essential to remember?\" It is very important to God that we give diligence to remember some things, especially God Himself. A list of practical ways to do this is given.",
