He talks of the very possibility at anytime the majority of Gods people can fall away into a falsity or lukewarmness whereas only a remnant is spared and saved. This message is very timely in our day and many of the statements given by Tozer will shake many of your convictions and even your standing in Christ, examine yourself!",

            "description": "In these last days, God is doing a work that will impact the world.  He is training a holy remnant that will be solely dedicated to God and His work during these last days. God is raising up a people who are committed to him and his cause who are a holy remnant, and who are steadfast and sure of their God. Eli was judged soft on sin and allowed wickedness in the tabernacle at Shiloh; even his own sons. Today, the church world is a laughing stock because of wickedness in the house of God, there is no power or spiritual authority, no presence of the Lord in many churches. But there is an unseen remnant of people, who would surprise you, because they are not prominent, or well known, but they are shut in with and hearing a word from God. And the word is prepare, for judgment is coming.",
