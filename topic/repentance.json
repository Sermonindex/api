Today Jesus stands and cries out the same words to a church that has no the prophetic word and no manifest presence of the Spirit. Verse 39 explains why: \"the Holy Ghost was not yet given; because that Jesus was not yet glorified.\" The Holy Spirit is not given when Jesus is not glorified and His Lordship not recognized. The baptism of the Holy Spirit is the coronation of the Lord Jesus in the heart of the believer. Revival is the coronation of the Lord Jesus in His church.",

The priest, whose charge it was to instruct the people in the ways of the ways of the Lord, had neglected their duty and no longer taught the people, for this God held them accountable.  The people of Israel had pushed God away so much that He would no longer warn them of their errors and He acctually departed from them in order to leave them their own devices. God's desire was that Israel would return to Him, and so Hosea wanted to lead the people in repentance towards the Lord for he knew that if the people would seek Him then He would be found of them.",

SPURGEON, AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153There were present at that season some that told him of the Galileans, whose blood Pilate had mingled with their sacrifices. And Jesus answering said unto them, suppose ye that these Galileans were sinners above all the Galileans, because they suffered such things? I tell you, Nay: but, except ye repent, ye shall all likewise perish. Or those eighteen, upon whom the tower in Siloam fell and slew them, think ye that they were sinners above all men that dwelt in Jerusalem! I tell you, Nay: but, except ye repent, ye shall all likewise perish.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d \u00e2\u20ac\u201d Luke 13:1-5. THE year 1861 will have a notoriety among its fellows as the year of calamities. Just at that season when man goeth forth to reap the fruit of his labors, when the harvest of the earth is ripe, and the barns are beginning to burst with the new wheat, Death too, the mighty reaper, has come forth to cut down his harvest; full sheaves have been gathered into his garner \u00e2\u20ac\u201d the tomb, and terrible have been the wailings which compose the harvest hymn of death. In reading the newspapers during the last two weeks, even the most stolid must have been the subject of very painful feelings. Not only have there been catastrophes so alarming that the blood chills at their remembrance, but column after column of the paper has been devoted to calamities of a minor degree of horror...",

            "description": "Brother Reidhead addresses many of the sayings of Christ and Paul that cut the most, and the modern errors of thinking that do not show fruit of these verses and concepts; namely: repentance, submission, fellowship with God, and stedfast faith. \"Are you prepared to pray in accord with this sovereign and gracious operation of God? If you are then you're going to change your praying. Instead of saying, initially, 'Lord, save Him,' you're going to say, 'Lord, slay him. Bring him to the awareness of his desperate plight. Awaken him to his danger. Convict him of his crimes.'\"",

It makes one ask the question, \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcwho then shall be saved?\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 This is the type of Word that can make every one of us lose hope, for who of us haven\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t been in the same boat? Who of us haven\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t fallen into sin after being a Christian? One thinks of Esau who sought repentance with tears but could not find it. We need to carefully examine this scripture. We should never take God lightly. A person so easily falls into sexual immorality, or some other sin. And then that person confesses the sin but go back to it a few days later. Such a person is poking his finger in God\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s eyes and his future is not good. What is man that you should be fearful of him? Rather fear God Who can put both soul and body in hell (Matt 10:28).",

There will be a time of great tribulation for the nation of Israel that will culminate in the second advent of the Lord Jesus.  The rest of the chapter gets back into the teritory of God's charges against Israel, these include exploitation, injustice and the most abominable sexual sins, it is again more evidence of adulterous attitude of Israel toward the Lord, but also shows how we are toward Him aswell in running after our 'idols'.",

The tax collectors in Jesus\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 day collected the tax for the government of the day, the Roman government. Nobody liked them. When they taxed people, they would add to the cost for their own pocket. They were thieves, charging more than the government required. And even today there are such people in the world who require bribes for their work. These tax collectors were therefore despised. And Jesus was sitting with them and ate with them! We must be careful interpreting this lest we think that Jesus loves a person that is corrupt and steals from others. And the sinners with whom Jesus ate would include those who divorce, adulterers, drunkards, blasphemers of God, very evil people.",

This happens when we forget our dependency on Jesus and become casual with His presence. When we become familiar with the presence of God we develop a \"we don't need the Holy Spirit because we have everything all figured out\" type attitude. When we do this, we are separating ourselves from the Spirit of God and we are operating with our natural senses. God's spirit will not strive with man and He will not share His glory with anyone. We must watch for and maintain a determination in our hearts that all that we do is for the glory of God and for the testimony of His power.",

            "description": "Here the Lord Jesus is carrying the Cross on the way to Golgotha. A great crowd surrounded Him, some with love and pity, but others with hate and mocking Him. And then there were those who were just inquisitive, wanting to see what was going on.Along the way there was a man called \"Simon of Cyrene\". When Jesus\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 strength was failing under the Cross, they looked for a person to carry the cross and they got Simon to carry the Cross. He was, according to some Bible commentators, the father of Alexander and Rufus who became members of the New Testament church. He didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want to but he was forced to. He was born in North Africa. Through his carrying the Cross there was blessing upon his children. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a pity when Africans say that Jesus is for the white people. We find so other instances where Jesus identifies with those of Africa, like in this instance, and also when Joseph had to flee to Egypt because Herod wanted to kill the baby Jesus, Africa gave Jesus refuge.",

It will be revealed in eternity of how many times God warned us, gave us wake up calls, for what was coming, but we missed the warning signals. I believe our nation, and particularly the church is at this cross road now. God has sent alarming signs to us to show us the path we are on and what is coming. And unless a proper response is done by the church, we will go down in the history books as, 'having eyes to see, but could not see; having ears to hear, but could not hear'. Brethren I beseech you take notice of these words and let us respond now, while there is still time, before the 'night cometh when no man can work'.",
