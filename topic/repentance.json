Today Jesus stands and cries out the same words to a church that has no the prophetic word and no manifest presence of the Spirit. Verse 39 explains why: \"the Holy Ghost was not yet given; because that Jesus was not yet glorified.\" The Holy Spirit is not given when Jesus is not glorified and His Lordship not recognized. The baptism of the Holy Spirit is the coronation of the Lord Jesus in the heart of the believer. Revival is the coronation of the Lord Jesus in His church.",

The priest, whose charge it was to instruct the people in the ways of the ways of the Lord, had neglected their duty and no longer taught the people, for this God held them accountable.  The people of Israel had pushed God away so much that He would no longer warn them of their errors and He acctually departed from them in order to leave them their own devices.

There will be a time of great tribulation for the nation of Israel that will culminate in the second advent of the Lord Jesus.

The tax collectors in Jesus\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 day collected the tax for the government of the day, the Roman government. Nobody liked them. When they taxed people, they would add to the cost for their own pocket. They were thieves, charging more than the government required. And even today there are such people in the world who require bribes for their work. These tax collectors were therefore despised. And Jesus was sitting with them and ate with them! We must be careful interpreting this lest we think that Jesus loves a person that is corrupt and steals from others. And the sinners with whom Jesus ate would include those who divorce, adulterers, drunkards, blasphemers of God, very evil people.",

And then there were those who were just inquisitive, wanting to see what was going on.Along the way there was a man called \"Simon of Cyrene\". When Jesus\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 strength was failing under the Cross, they looked for a person to carry the cross and they got Simon to carry the Cross. He was, according to some Bible commentators, the father of Alexander and Rufus who became members of the New Testament church. He didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want to but he was forced to. He was born in North Africa. Through his carrying the Cross there was blessing upon his children. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a pity when Africans say that Jesus is for the white people. We find so other instances where Jesus identifies with those of Africa, like in this instance, and also when Joseph had to flee to Egypt because Herod wanted to kill the baby Jesus, Africa gave Jesus refuge.",

I believe our nation, and particularly the church is at this cross road now. God has sent alarming signs to us to show us the path we are on and what is coming. And unless a proper response is done by the church, we will go down in the history books as, 'having eyes to see, but could not see; having ears to hear, but could not hear'. Brethren I beseech you take notice of these words and let us respond now, while there is still time, before the 'night cometh when no man can work'.",
