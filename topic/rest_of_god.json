He was radically converted by reading the New Testament. God used him to have a powerful prophetic insight into the end-times and the coming suffering of the jewish people before the great accepting of Jesus as Messiah. His eschatological insight is a very needful truth to be realized in the body of Christ. \r\n\r\nArt was a prophetic voice insofar as he called his listeners to purposes in God that would affect both time and eternity, purposes that had to do with the glory of God in the Church.   Frequently, his messages called the Church to an awareness of the Last Days [End-times] in such a way that made that time seem imminent and at the door.",

God looks to the man who has a broken spirit and a contrite heart, the man who knows he has no resources apart from God. The man who comes to God with the little he has and offers it to Him will be used by God to do the miraculous . It is in this Heart that God can rest.",

Carter illustrates, through various scriptures, how Christians find themselves in dry places because they are not content in the station that God has put them in.  An illustration that Carter used was the complaining that the children went through in the wilderness when they weren\u2019t content with the manna. The scripture that this sermon was built around was Psalm 106:15  And he gave them their request; but sent leanness into their soul.",
