When Jesus rose from the dead His resurrection life became available to all who would want it. If we are going to be blessed of God there is a journey involved. This journey will lead us to a place called Bethel where we are separated for the purposes of God. We will also be led to Jericho where we learn to trust God to break down every stronghold the the enemy has erected. As we walk with the Lord being one at heart with Him, He will anoint us and give us power to bring life into barren places.",
