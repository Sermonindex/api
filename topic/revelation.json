He was radically converted by reading the New Testament. God used him to have a powerful prophetic insight into the end-times and the coming suffering of the jewish people before the great accepting of Jesus as Messiah. His eschatological insight is a very needful truth to be realized in the body of Christ. \r\n\r\nArt was a prophetic voice insofar as he called his listeners to purposes in God that would affect both time and eternity, purposes that had to do with the glory of God in the Church.   Frequently, his messages called the Church to an awareness of the Last Days [End-times] in such a way that made that time seem imminent and at the door.",

If we do not see within ourselves that which falls short of the glory of God we would be content with our lives the way they are and fail to demand the exchange that is rightfully ours. We must cry out to the Holy Spirit to uncover the corruption and then come to heavens exchange counter to give us what we need to walk in the abundant life.",
