After hearing Paul Washer's \"Ten Indictments,\" I wondered what God would have me do, and Denny delivered God's suggestions, taken from the apostle John's first letter.  In a dynamic, interesting, and thought-provoking manner, Denny defines revival, and illustrates how revival should be our normal experience.  \"Ten Indictments\" and \"Revival According to John\" are two very powerful words needed in our church today, and as the apostle Paul and the early church father James stand back to back and look at both sides of faith and works, Paul Washer and Denny Kenaston give us a divinely-balanced approach to understanding the revival and reformation God desires in His people today.",
