Orr gives a very informative overview of the beginnings of the third great awakening in American history (which is largely overlooked), starting around 1830, and went on for 12 years. He recounted the events preceding Charles Finney's famous revival in Rochester, New York, in that same year. He explained how 100,000 people were saved as a result of that revival when the town only had a population of 10,000. Orr also defused how false reports of people barking took place on the Frontier, and recounted how greatly the Hawaiian Islands were affected.",

Orr speaks on the awakening that started in 1857 with a prayer meeting in New York City with one man and ended up with the whole city packed out with prayer meetings in churches and auditoriums. It spread all over the nation, so glorious that D.L. Moody said at the end of his life (1899) that we wished to see that happen again in the Church. Orr relates how this awakening and conversions spread to Ireland and South Africa. He recounts an interesting event with Andrew Murray trying to bring order to a prayer meeting! Out of this revival came D. L. Moody, William Booth, Charles Spurgeon and others. The main theme is how through prayer people encountered the presence of the Lord. \"In times of revival, sinners come running to the Lord,\" Orr said. Indeed they did!",

Jonathan Edwards and others called for \"extraordinary prayer.\"  A union of churches began praying, with Boston seeing the beginnings of revival in 1792 and general national revival by 1798.  James McGrady asked his congregants to pray for him in 1799, and showers of blessing came in 1800 on the Kentucky frontier.  Out of this revival missionary societies began and colleges became training centers for young pastors and missionaries.",

It was spectacularly noted for extradordinary conversions and calls to service.  What led to this great awakening was a laymen's movement among churches for united prayer for God's outpouring of the Spirit.

            "description": "Testimony and interview with Bill McLeod. He describes a revival that broke out in his church and grew as the Spirit moved in the area.The revival turned into a situation where buildings could not hold the people. There was rarely a full sermon given where the gospel message was preached, but yet hundreds of people were being converted and revived. The main focus of the message is to clean up our lives as Christians, and then God the Holy Ghost will do the work; we just have to get out of the way. Don't organize, don't build it up, just let God work, be obediant to Him, and our prayers will then be answered.",

Although the revival tide was out between World War I and World War II in America, Britain and western Europe, God was doing great things on the frontiers.  Orr recounts revival in Ireland under Nicholson in the '20's which affected his life.  He recollects personal testimony of being in revivals in Norway, Canada and a localized one at Wheaton college.  Orr closes by highlighting great extended periods of revivals in China and East Africa that prepared the Church to stand under great times of persecution.",
