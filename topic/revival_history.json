He recounted the events preceding Charles Finney's famous revival in Rochester, New York, in that same year. He explained how 100,000 people were saved as a result of that revival when the town only had a population of 10,000. Orr also defused how false reports of people barking took place on the Frontier, and recounted how greatly the Hawaiian Islands were affected.",

Orr speaks on the awakening that started in 1857 with a prayer meeting in New York City with one man and ended up with the whole city packed out with prayer meetings in churches and auditoriums. It spread all over the nation, so glorious that D.L. Moody said at the end of his life (1899) that we wished to see that happen again in the Church. Orr relates how this awakening and conversions spread to Ireland and South Africa. He recounts an interesting event with Andrew Murray trying to bring order to a prayer meeting! Out of this revival came D. L. Moody, William Booth, Charles Spurgeon and others. The main theme is how through prayer people encountered the presence of the Lord. \"In times of revival, sinners come running to the Lord,\" Orr said. Indeed they did!",

Orr sets out on part 1 of describing what is known in America as \"The Great Awakening\" and its equivalent in Britain starting in 1727 with on fire Moravians.  The conditions in the world at that time that preceeded the awakening were deplorable and rotten--the gambling, drinking, slave trade, etc. as well as the once powerful Baptists, Congregationalists and Puritans that had lost their spirituality and power.  John Wesley, George Whitfield and Jonathan Edwards came into prominence around 1738 and Orr, in his typical fashion, paints a colorful description of what God was powerfully doing through these men of God.",

James McGrady asked his congregants to pray for him in 1799, and showers of blessing came in 1800 on the Kentucky frontier.

What led to this great awakening was a laymen's movement among churches for united prayer for God's outpouring of the Spirit.

The main focus of the message is to clean up our lives as Christians, and then God the Holy Ghost will do the work; we just have to get out of the way. Don't organize, don't build it up, just let God work, be obediant to Him, and our prayers will then be answered.",
