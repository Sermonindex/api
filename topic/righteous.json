When the new life of Christ comes into us there is an evident outward working of righteousness.

We are the temple of thre Holy Spirit and God's presence in our life is a restrainer of evil. When we choose to walk in right relation with God distresses and judgments can be averted by the restraning power of God and this generation has a chance to hear His voice.
