Manley chose daily healing because for him it was an act of faith that each day the Lord had to heal him to the point that he could get out of bed. During those years there were more confinements in the hospital, as well as trips to Europe and revivals all over the United States.

With this new nature of Christ came a deep inner longing and a groan that was put there by God. This inner groaning leads us into the depth of the life of Christ. We groan to become the new creation that God has intended us to be. Satan's most potent tactic against the righteous is to get us to feel that somehow we have fallen into disfavor with God in times of deep inner troubling, when in reality something more deep is going on inside of us. God by His grace will put a groaning in our heart to know Christ in His power and Truth and nothing but CHRIST will satisfy us.",
