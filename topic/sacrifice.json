            "description": "This message starts with a brief summary of what Mr Washer preached earlier in the week. Then, after exhorting fathers in the fulfilling of their Biblical responsibilities, he turns to Romans 12:1-2 where the apostle Paul urges us to give our lives away; not for a cause, but to a Person. Our motivation for doing so is \u2018the mercies of God\u2019, which Mr Washer then explains. This laying down of one\u2019s life is a once-and-for-all decision; but why does Paul say, Present your bodies? For one thing, it destroys the notion that a man can outwardly live in ungodliness whilst claiming that in his heart he really loves Jesus Christ. Furthermore, the things we do in our bodies are evidence of our sanctification and dedication to God. Mr Washer also examines in some detail what we put in to our bodies, revealing our responsibilities before God and men. He then considers in turn our eyes, ears, tongue, hands and feet, and how we clothe our bodies; he pleads with us to do all things to the glory of God.  (46 minutes).",

            "description": "Part 2 opens with one more example of presenting our bodies a living sacrifice: the dangers of dating. This is so rarely taught that something has to be said from a Biblical basis. Parents are not teaching their children their responsibilities, and the church is not showing the parents how. Biblical counsel is this: don\u2019t put yourself in the way of temptation. This issue is not a question of the intellect, it\u2019s a question of the will: we know what\u2019s right, we just don\u2019t want to do it. Proceeding into v.2,  Mr Washer explains what it means to be not conformed to this world, both for individuals and for the church. He explains that the renewing of the mind is a total transformation, a supernatural creative work of God. He then examines the will of God, and how you will know it by its characteristics of being good, acceptable and perfect. This message outlines practical issues that we all have to deal with. Believing the doctrine is one thing; but is it a growing, practical reality in your life? If not, stop and deal with it, one step at a time.  (43 minutes)",

Our flesh doesn't like these kind of messages, but there is tremendous spiritual growth possible to the one who submits to God's chastening.",
