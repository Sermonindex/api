Stewart first came to Church of the Resurrection as a Wheaton College junior on Palm Sunday, 1988. Katherine and he learned from and served under Fr. William and Anne Beasley for a decade at Resurrection. During this time Stewart completed his Master's in Theology at Wheaton College Graduate School (where he was awarded the Kenneth Kantzer prize for theology) and ministered on college campuses in Chicago with InterVarsity Christian Fellowship. The combination of Resurrection, Wheaton College, and InterVarsity provided a most dynamic training season for the ministry. Here he learned how to lead (especially in regard to vision and liturgy), how to minister in the power of the Holy Spirit, and how to read and preach God's Word and to study the teachings of the Great Tradition.\r\n\r\nAnother ministry passion of Stewart's is raising up leaders and church planters.  In September 2013, Stewart was consecrated Bishop of the Anglican Diocese of the Upper Midwest (ACNA). By the end of 2018, the Upper Midwest Diocese will have planted 35 new churches in 7 states since being formed a diocese in June 2013. He has a vision to see a Revival of Word and Sacrament infused by the Holy Spirit in the Upper Midwest.",

Then, after exhorting fathers in the fulfilling of their Biblical responsibilities, he turns to Romans 12:1-2 where the apostle Paul urges us to give our lives away; not for a cause, but to a Person. Our motivation for doing so is \u2018the mercies of God\u2019, which Mr Washer then explains. This laying down of one\u2019s life is a once-and-for-all decision; but why does Paul say, Present your bodies? For one thing, it destroys the notion that a man can outwardly live in ungodliness whilst claiming that in his heart he really loves Jesus Christ. Furthermore, the things we do in our bodies are evidence of our sanctification and dedication to God. Mr Washer also examines in some detail what we put in to our bodies, revealing our responsibilities before God and men. He then considers in turn our eyes, ears, tongue, hands and feet, and how we clothe our bodies; he pleads with us to do all things to the glory of God.  (46 minutes).",

            "description": "Part 2 opens with one more example of presenting our bodies a living sacrifice: the dangers of dating. This is so rarely taught that something has to be said from a Biblical basis. Parents are not teaching their children their responsibilities, and the church is not showing the parents how. Biblical counsel is this: don\u2019t put yourself in the way of temptation. This issue is not a question of the intellect, it\u2019s a question of the will: we know what\u2019s right, we just don\u2019t want to do it. Proceeding into v.2,  Mr Washer explains what it means to be not conformed to this world, both for individuals and for the church. He explains that the renewing of the mind is a total transformation, a supernatural creative work of God. He then examines the will of God, and how you will know it by its characteristics of being good, acceptable and perfect. This message outlines practical issues that we all have to deal with. Believing the doctrine is one thing; but is it a growing, practical reality in your life? If not, stop and deal with it, one step at a time.  (43 minutes)",

Pastor Derek and Stacey Melton planted Pryor ON Fire Teen Ministries in 1991, having a deep burden to reach the troubled youth of our generation with the saving gospel of Jesus Christ. This burden soon gave birth to an opportunity for teens to begin meeting in a small classroom south of Pryor. This was the birth of Pryor ON Fire Teen Ministries. After a short time that small classroom was packed and overflowing so the meetings were moved to two different locations, both of which were outgrown. The ministry continued to expand and grow as Thunderbird Youth Academy began to bus their cadets to the services weekly to join with local youth. In January of 1999, Pastor Derek and Stacey once again, felt the undeniable burden of the Lord to plant a church for adults who had began to attend these teen services. Grace Life Church was born out of this burden. The ministry was then moved to 110 E. Graham, where the ministry has purchased two properties giving the ministry 14,000 sq. ft., and a sanctuary that will seat over 250. The ministry resides in this location today.\r\nToday, Pastor Derek and Stacey continue to experience a deep burden for at-risk youth struggling in our generation, ministering Jesus Christ and His love to hurting teens several times per week. Grace Life Church is also a godly presence in our city, as many families have found their place in this Christ exalting body of believers. These members are maturing in Christ from glory to glory.",
