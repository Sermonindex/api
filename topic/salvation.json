Two ways the Father seeks is He allows the son to go and waste his inheritance and sends a famine \"to lower the bottom.\"  The great love of God is pictured here in the only place in the whole Bible where we see Him running.",

As you meet up with things enough to make you afraid you will need the Lord to be your fortress. And when the wicked come up against you and those that hate you oppose you, then you will need the Lord to be with you that you can overcome. The devil comes in many different ways, not only with his horns and hooves and tail, but also as an angel of light. David goes on to say that even if an army encamps against him he won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be afraid for he is trusting in God.",

Stewart first came to Church of the Resurrection as a Wheaton College junior on Palm Sunday, 1988. Katherine and he learned from and served under Fr. William and Anne Beasley for a decade at Resurrection. During this time Stewart completed his Master's in Theology at Wheaton College Graduate School (where he was awarded the Kenneth Kantzer prize for theology) and ministered on college campuses in Chicago with InterVarsity Christian Fellowship. The combination of Resurrection, Wheaton College, and InterVarsity provided a most dynamic training season for the ministry. Here he learned how to lead (especially in regard to vision and liturgy), how to minister in the power of the Holy Spirit, and how to read and preach God's Word and to study the teachings of the Great Tradition.\r\n\r\nAnother ministry passion of Stewart's is raising up leaders and church planters.  In September 2013, Stewart was consecrated Bishop of the Anglican Diocese of the Upper Midwest (ACNA). By the end of 2018, the Upper Midwest Diocese will have planted 35 new churches in 7 states since being formed a diocese in June 2013. He has a vision to see a Revival of Word and Sacrament infused by the Holy Spirit in the Upper Midwest.",
