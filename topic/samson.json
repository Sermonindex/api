He was born in Newtownards, County Down, Ireland in 1911. In his book Tramp after God, he tells of living for more than three years as a tramp abusing alcohol and involved in crime. Willie Mullan had a religious conversion and from that time forward he decided he would strive to serve God.\r\n\r\n In 1953 Willie Mullan was called to Lurgan Baptist church, and in August of that year he commenced the work in Lurgan. One of his great accomplishments during this time was the Tuesday night Bible class. Every Tuesday night hundreds attended to hear the exposition of the Word. In 1957 William Hewitt and a team of helpers commenced the tape recordings of the Bible class. At least 1500 of these recordings remain until this day.",

            "description": "This is not what you think. This message is a real treat and eye-opener. So, be sure to have a pen and paper handy to jot down the other scriptures. When Samson stood captive in the presence of the Philistines and they mocked and laughed at him, now blind, and seemingly defeated, they had no idea they were about to die. Today many Christians are in positions where the enemy of their souls taunts and ridicules them, but like Samson, we have the Source of power we need to overcome. This is an excellent message on spiritual warfare and victory.",
