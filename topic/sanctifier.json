That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s what He says to the Father, that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s His divine will for all of us this morning. Tell me, are you on the way this morning to become like Jesus?  You can file and hammer and saw and solder and let the fire burn and go through the acid all you want, and you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll never be more than an old good-for-nothing.  You can try and sanctify yourself, and you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll never be more sanctified than you are right now.  You\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll never change yourself.  But, oh, when God changes me\u00e2\u20ac\u201dwhen Jesus Christ changes me by coming to dwell within me\u00e2\u20ac\u201d\u00e2\u20ac\u0153I in them and Thou in Me\u00e2\u20ac\u009d!",
