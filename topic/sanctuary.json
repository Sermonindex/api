            "description": "June 15, 2008 - There are demonic voices and powers of darkness that attempt to turn us away from the power we have in Christ. These voices will say you can't go any farther with God. This message reminds us that it is the LORD who sets the boundaries in the Earth and the truth is that it is the devil who could only go as far as the bloodline of Jesus Christ. It is time to rise up in faith and tell whatever voice is telling us \"we can't\", that God can! God desires to stretch forth His hand and heal us so we can be agents of healing to the unsaved.",
