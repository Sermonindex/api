If you have decided to cross the line of luke warmness and you are fully surrendered to the Lord's purposes you will become a target for satan. Nothing shakes the kingdom of hell more than a prayng Christian who is sold out for Jesus. When satan recognizes this fire in us he will attempt to torment our minds with evil thoughts of past failures and sin. His plan is to neutralize our spiritual fight. God is calling us to get our focus off our afflictions and sin and go back to the New Covenant and declare Jesus to be the Highest Authority than anything the devil can throw at us.",

The Lord gave him a gift of faith to trust the Lord in impossible circumstances for God's glory. Even though Manley Beasley was not very old as we measure a life's span, he left behind a legacy of faith that was rarely seen in his generation. We pray that he will be honored and the Lord glorified by this attempt to share this legacy with all who would live a life of faith that is truly pleasing to God.\r\nThere came a time when Manley believed the Lord gave him a choice of complete healing or daily healing. Manley chose daily healing because for him it was an act of faith that each day the Lord had to heal him to the point that he could get out of bed. During those years there were more confinements in the hospital, as well as trips to Europe and revivals all over the United States. He led Bible Conferences, revivals, and shared his personal testimony with others dealing with illness.",
