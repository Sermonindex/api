            "description": "Brother Ken Ham explains to his audience how Answers In Genesis is on a mission to establish the authority of the Word of God more than they are out to debate evolution vs. creationism.  He shows how important it is to filter all of history through what the scriptures say happened than to reverse that and make the bible accountable to humanistic thought.  He shows how if you cannot believe what the Bible says about Biology, Geology, and Astronomy, what are you going to do when it talks about morality?  He also points out how the Holy Spirit predicted the scoffing view of evolution through 2Peter 3:3-7. Ham also explains how so many things we believe moralistically come from Genesis 1-11.",
