We should prepare for His coming knowing that it is only by His grace that we will be fully ready. Spiritual things should be the first priority in our lives and we should live for God's purpose, separated from the world. The Lord is coming for those wise servants that prepared themselves for His coming. They were looking for His coming. The foolish servant is living for the temporal and is not looking for the Lord's coming. The wise servant is one that is filled with the Holy Spirit. The wise servant uses the Lord's talents to advance the kingdom of God. In Summary: Our attitude towards His coming must be right. We must be filled with the Spirit. We should serve the Lord with the gifts and talents that He has given unto us.",

In spite of many Evangelicals\u2019 dogmatic preoccupation with how to view the millennium, something has not changed and must never be forgotten: Jesus is coming back. Take heed. Beware. Watch.
