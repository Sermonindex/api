            "description": "It is essential that Christians spend time daily shut in with the Lord, giving him quality time. A praying woman who spends time regularly with the Lord has an orderly home. If there is chaos, and confusion, it is because of a lack of prayer, most of the time. This is a firm, but loving rebuke to those who do not pray as they know they are supposed to. Issues as to why the lack of prayer are addressed in a helpful way.",
