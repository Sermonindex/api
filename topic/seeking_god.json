How even though you offer your sacrifices of praise and worship there has to be a cleanliness of heart before you approach the throne of the Living God. Too many people come to church with their mind elsewhere and are only going through the motions. We must be honest and keep our focus on the Lord when we come into his house. Wait on him, love him. God wants to take the burden out of those who are coming before him. He doesn't want us going through the motions of coming to church heavy with burdens we are trying to deal with ourselves.",

Salvation consists in knowing God.  How many, many people miss it!  How very, very few people in the world know God! You can tell it when you travel through the world and meet with works and ministers.  The great complaint is like it was by the prophet Jeremiah: the priests knew not the Lord.  How differently they would act and live and minister if they knew the Lord!  How different our conventions would turn out if those in charge knew the Lord!  But why don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t we know Him?  Jesus says, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Every one that seeketh findeth.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d  Findeth what?  Why, findeth God. Are we seeking God?  Are we really seeking God?  Then we shall find Him.  God says we shall find Him.
