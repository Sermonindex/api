            "description": "Don\u2019t be too quick to comes to God 's defense and say God never asks too much. This message suggests that God ALWAYS asks too much and it is never God's design or desire that we should ever be in a place where we think that what God is requiring is something that we can bring about in our own strength or by our own power. When God first speaks His promises to us there is strong expectancy for the fulfillment of that promise. But as time passes on and we are still waiting the possible begins to seem impossible. It is in these times of delay that our flesh will begin to think that we can make things happen in our own time and our own way. God in His mercy will bring us through the refiner's fire so we can let go of all that we think we are and what we think we are supposed to do. He will refine our gifts and our calling until He has complete ownership and lordship over them.",
