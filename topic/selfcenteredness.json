            "description": "In order to walk in victory over self-centeredness, we must reckon this flesh to have been crucified with Christ on the cross.  If we are living with the sole purpose of chasing after worldly things like food, clothing, a good comfortable life, popularity or advancement, we have not accepted that Jesus died for these things. Brother Zac points out in this sermon how salvation is completely free, but there are things in Christianity that will cost us.  Can you be so lost in ministry that you lose a meal? Suffer persecution?  While emphasizing that we must be victorious in these areas we are encouraged to accept the concept of steady progress over these sins as is shown to be a thematic of New Covenant faith.",

God called brother Zac Poonen to a new work early on in his Christian experience. The movement is now called Christian Fellowship Churches where the New Covenant of New Testament Christianity is clearly preached. \r\n\r\nBrother Zac Poonen has written 25 books most of them being on the deeper Christian life. Many of these have been translated into a number of languages and have been circulated widely around the world. He clearly and passionately shares the  narrow way of Christian discipleship that is neglected by so many modern preachers.",
