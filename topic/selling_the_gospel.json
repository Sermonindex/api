            "description": "You have never heard the tabernacle of the Lord explained as you will here. From Matthew 21 where Jesus overthrew the tables and ran the moneychangers out of the temple, to 2nd Chronicles 6 and 7 when Solomon built the temple and dedicated it, the purpose of the temple is explained in depth. This is a real eye-opener on prayer. Just as the religious Pharisees were ineffective and uncaring for the lost, with no real compassion, today many Christians are caught up in worldly things, while their family and friends are lost,  too busy to pray as they should. Jesus said his house should be a house of prayer and we are the temple of God. Are we houses of prayer? Do we pray as we should?",
