            "description": "Dr. Smith explains how Jesus created our senses to work.  By explaining these modes of operation, he ruminates on how a savior was so wise and intelligent in his thoughts.  He shows how God was not just utilitarian in his creation, but that he was also considerate of creating us to enjoy pleasure.  Dr. Smith argues through these understandings of the senses, both sensory as well as extra-sensory, that we come to a deeper understanding of the thoughtfulness of God, and why it is so wrong to believe in the theory of evolution, as it harms a child\u2019s understanding of the care of God.   If by the use of our extra-sensory perception, we perceive that we are far from the Lord, we need to see and evaluate if there is any wicked way in us.",
