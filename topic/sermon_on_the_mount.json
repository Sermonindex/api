He gives a very straight forward call for the Church to be that positive agent, saline and different then the world so we can have a positive effect on it morally and bring glory to the name of God. He mentions about Holiness and many other things, this sermon is one of utmost importance to listen to for the nomial Chrisitan in our day.",
