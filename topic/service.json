But the danger of causing another to fall in his right to excercise his liberty, he would rather not, if it would make one fall. Even though he had a right to expect to be supported financially by the church as a minister, he chose to work to support himself, by working with his own hands, driven to preach the gospel, but did not expect reward from anyone other than God. Paul said he was compelled to preach the Gospel. Something is wrong with believers by the multitudes who feel compelled to do nothing for Christ. We as believers need to know what the Lord placed us in the Body of Christ to do. A gripping message!",
