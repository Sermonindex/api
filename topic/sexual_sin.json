            "description": "Our Nation is in serious spiritual need but in God's word, the Bible, we find answers to our moral and social problems as a nation. Sadly these days, our Nation is marked not only by an unrestrained and unashamed abandonment to sensuality but also by the putrid sin of sexual perversion. What is called sexual orientation and an alternative lifestyle today, God has always called an abomination, which he visits with severe judgment but from which he offers salvation.  In this message from God's Word to our Nation, we hear God's rebuke and denunciation for our nation's aggravated moral sins and a call to repentance and prayer. There is cleansing in the blood of Christ for all of our sexual sins. 1 Corinthians 6:9-11",
