When we finally come to a place when we die to our own strength, reasoning and will and cast ourselves into the hands of Jesus, He will give us the ability, by His Spirit, to be all that He created us to be. Life begins when we come to the realization that if we are going to do anything for the glory of God it is only by His presence and power that we are able to do it.",
