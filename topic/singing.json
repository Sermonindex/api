            "description": "There are three ways that God protects his people from danger. Sometimes he prevents danger from even arising on the horizon of our lives. Other times he allows the danger to attack, and gives us the victory so that we live on and serve him in gladness. But in the end one enemy is never driven off, the enemy of death. We will all die if the Lord does not return in our lifetime. But here, too, God protects. He protects us from unbelief, and preserves us for his heavenly kingdom.",
