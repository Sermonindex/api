            "description": "This is about how to get and maintain the blessing of the Lord. Thinking wrong in our hearts hinders our praise, and we might not even realize we slander the Lord by negative thoughts. Most of us would say we haven't slandered God. Every Christian should listen to this message, and find out for sure. You know God worked for you in the past but do you wonder if he's going to help you this time? That is one example of slandering your heavenly Father. This message will challenge and enlighten all who listen with an open heart.",
