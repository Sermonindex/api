            "description": "David Wilkerson preaches from Daniel 10, this is a very powerful messages, it really impacted the people in this conference. You can hear the wailing and weeping of people as God's spirit begins to convict and deal with peoples hearts. God called Moses and the 70 elders to come up to the mountain into his presence to meet with him. \"They all saw the God of Israel;\" (24:10), and they ate in his presence, and did drink. (v. 11) But only Moses was allowed to meet with God, and called on up further. The others were told to wait. But they did not. This message deals with the issues of the heart that hinder or prevent us from going all the way and answering the wooing of the Holy Spirit to come out from among them and seek the face of God.  [i]NOTE: First 15 minutes of this message is worship in slovak. And the message is intrepreted to the people in slovak.[\/i]",
