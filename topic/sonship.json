This sermon discusses how the Lord will grant the power of His Spirit to those who are growing in this obedience.  It is through this process that the character of God will be granted to his sons and daughters.  It is a sign of maturity when one recognizes that their obedience\u2019s will be misconstrued by others.   Halfway through this file is a question and answer time where both Art Katz and Simon Hensman field concerns and curiosities raised by believers in Singapore.",
