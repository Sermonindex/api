He was born in Newtownards, County Down, Ireland in 1911. In his book Tramp after God, he tells of living for more than three years as a tramp abusing alcohol and involved in crime. Willie Mullan had a religious conversion and from that time forward he decided he would strive to serve God.\r\n\r\n In 1953 Willie Mullan was called to Lurgan Baptist church, and in August of that year he commenced the work in Lurgan. One of his great accomplishments during this time was the Tuesday night Bible class. Every Tuesday night hundreds attended to hear the exposition of the Word. In 1957 William Hewitt and a team of helpers commenced the tape recordings of the Bible class. At least 1500 of these recordings remain until this day.",

In the coming days many will experience intense sorrow as our image of God and our own image of how we think Christ should be glorified through us will suddenly be taken away from us. Things that we thought we were going to be in Christ and things that we thought God was obligated to do through us will suddenly be shaken. God in His mercy will shake everything that can be shaken so we can gain a right perspective of who He is and who we are in Christ! God will shake it all until all worldly security is gone and there is nothing left in His church but Christ Himself!",
