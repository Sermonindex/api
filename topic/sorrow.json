            "description": "November 1, 2009 - Many of us who are on a journey with the Lord come into the Kingdom with our own ideas about how He should manifest His life through us. In the coming days many will experience intense sorrow as our image of God and our own image of how we think Christ should be glorified through us will suddenly be taken away from us. Things that we thought we were going to be in Christ and things that we thought God was obligated to do through us will suddenly be shaken. God in His mercy will shake everything that can be shaken so we can gain a right perspective of who He is and who we are in Christ! God will shake it all until all worldly security is gone and there is nothing left in His church but Christ Himself!",

Jesus knocks at the door of every heart and if you choose to open up to Him, He will come in and begin to cause you to hope in a brand new life. God desires to take you deeper than just feeling good about the bad situations in life. He desires to bring you into His church and connect you to His body so that you will experience the complete revelation of Jesus Christ. You will find Him to be a very special friend who desires to fellowship with us. This is the good news that will lead you into a continual praise!",
