            "description": "Beginning with an explanation that soulishness is a topic many may not understand until later in their Christian walk, this sermon explains the dynamic of allowing biblical truth to hit the bedrock of the Christian\u2019s will as opposed to the sandier extremes of dry intellect or meaningless emotionalism.   He offers a balanced view on how to determine what soulishness is, and says that we must learn to allow the sword of the spirit to divide that which is of the soul from that which is of the Spirit, in order that we may fly out of this snare.",

God called brother Zac Poonen to a new work early on in his Christian experience. The movement is now called Christian Fellowship Churches where the New Covenant of New Testament Christianity is clearly preached. \r\n\r\nBrother Zac Poonen has written 25 books most of them being on the deeper Christian life. Many of these have been translated into a number of languages and have been circulated widely around the world. He clearly and passionately shares the  narrow way of Christian discipleship that is neglected by so many modern preachers.",
