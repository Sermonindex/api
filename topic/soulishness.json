            "description": "Beginning with an explanation that soulishness is a topic many may not understand until later in their Christian walk, this sermon explains the dynamic of allowing biblical truth to hit the bedrock of the Christian\u2019s will as opposed to the sandier extremes of dry intellect or meaningless emotionalism.   He offers a balanced view on how to determine what soulishness is, and says that we must learn to allow the sword of the spirit to divide that which is of the soul from that which is of the Spirit, in order that we may fly out of this snare.",
