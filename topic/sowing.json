Yet they promote the sin of Sodom and Gomorrah. Sodom and Gomorrah were totally burnt to ashes that there was not a trace left, and so it will go with those who practice this sin of homosexuality and these preachers who promote this lifestyle and lead others astray. There are so-called Christians who are just like these people in Jude, uprooted trees, wild waves of the sea, without fruit, twice dead. They cast up the foam of their own shame. The blackest darkness is reserved for them forever. Such ministers will reap a double hell, forever.",
