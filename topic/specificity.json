            "description": "The world hates a God who is specific about the things He chooses, for example, the nation Israel (the least of all peoples), Zion (a tiny hill - not a mountain), a stable (the birthplace of Messiah) and Calvary (a garbage dump) for the greatest revelation of Himself. A God who chooses is central to an understanding of the faith. Another incisive expression of God's choice of Israel with an excellent 'questions and answers' session at the end.",
