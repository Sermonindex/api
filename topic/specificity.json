            "description": "The world hates a God who is specific about the things He chooses, for example, the nation Israel (the least of all peoples), Zion (a tiny hill - not a mountain), a stable (the birthplace of Messiah) and Calvary (a garbage dump) for the greatest revelation of Himself. A God who chooses is central to an understanding of the faith. Another incisive expression of God's choice of Israel with an excellent 'questions and answers' session at the end.",

He was radically converted by reading the New Testament. God used him to have a powerful prophetic insight into the end-times and the coming suffering of the jewish people before the great accepting of Jesus as Messiah. His eschatological insight is a very needful truth to be realized in the body of Christ. \r\n\r\nArt was a prophetic voice insofar as he called his listeners to purposes in God that would affect both time and eternity, purposes that had to do with the glory of God in the Church.   Frequently, his messages called the Church to an awareness of the Last Days [End-times] in such a way that made that time seem imminent and at the door.",
