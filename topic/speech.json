Our report and observations of others around us may be accurate, but are they missing hope and faith?  Like Aaron our job is stand and bless not curse, and like Jesus to bear long with the infirmities of others, not accuse.  (NOTE: \"A Pure Heart\" is a follow-on to this sermon.)",

            "description": "In this message, Pastor Cymbala teaches about how important words are. Words can benefit and encourage those that listen. He shares how many christians grieve the Holy Spirit continually through the day with their speech. For believers we should not have unwholesome speech, anger, slander, wrath or critical talk. God can purify our hearts and tongues so that they are pleasing in His sight.",
