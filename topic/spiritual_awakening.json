It was spoken before a Campus Crusade for Christ fellowship or gathering. The many years of J. Edwin Orr's ministry and burden for revival really show through in this small sermon on the role of revival and prayer in God's awakening of the redeemed and saving of the lost.",

Spiritual awakenening is when God speaks and He has free course in our hearts and there is no resistance to His voice. When God finds a heart that does not resist His spoken Word the miraculous starts to happen. He speaks with intelligent speech and the power behind His words begins to shape and reshape our lives. If we are truly His and have given ourselves to the Lord we don't resist what He speaks into our hearts, but rather embrace it as the highest way of life. God is calling us to believe what He has already spoken and wants us to bind ourselves to His Word by faith.",
