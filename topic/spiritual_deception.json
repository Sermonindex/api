We as true believers can be led away by subtle things, building upon things that God never intended as \u201cbuilding blocks\u201d.  Jesus Christ must be the supreme Person we focus upon and talk about, not things.   This brother shares personal testimonies of God moving in everyday life that illustrate his passion--the centrality of Christ.",
