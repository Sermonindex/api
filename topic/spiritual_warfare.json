Brother Beasley was a powerful preacher of the Word of God who ministered mostly in southern Baptist churches in America. The Lord gave him a gift of faith to trust the Lord in impossible circumstances for God's glory. Even though Manley Beasley was not very old as we measure a life's span, he left behind a legacy of faith that was rarely seen in his generation. We pray that he will be honored and the Lord glorified by this attempt to share this legacy with all who would live a life of faith that is truly pleasing to God.\r\nThere came a time when Manley believed the Lord gave him a choice of complete healing or daily healing. Manley chose daily healing because for him it was an act of faith that each day the Lord had to heal him to the point that he could get out of bed. During those years there were more confinements in the hospital, as well as trips to Europe and revivals all over the United States. He led Bible Conferences, revivals, and shared his personal testimony with others dealing with illness.",

We pray that he will be honored and the Lord glorified by this attempt to share this legacy with all who would live a life of faith that is truly pleasing to God.\r\nThere came a time when Manley believed the Lord gave him a choice of complete healing or daily healing. Manley chose daily healing because for him it was an act of faith that each day the Lord had to heal him to the point that he could get out of bed. During those years there were more confinements in the hospital, as well as trips to Europe and revivals all over the United States.

There is a spiritual war waging around us at all times and many of us need to engage in this battle.  The problem is that we first have to win the battle within.  We have to allow grace to have its perfect work in our lives, we have to believe that God loves our souls and sent his son to die for them.  Ron Reed discusses how too many people view Christianity as a passive experience, and points out how the Devil will devour and pick off stragglers very easily when they fail to engage in the Spiritual warfare against their own inner voice or soul.  A strong exhortation is given to actively engage in a devotional life with God that encompasses meditation on the word and prayer.  He also discussed how one of the principle weapons the enemy uses against us is speculation.",
