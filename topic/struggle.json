            "description": "Mr Redpath confirms the difference between a joyous christian experience(in Christ), and the life of the unhappy Christian(still holding to self). But through it all, Jesus waits for us to say,\"Lord save me!\" Mr Redpath also speaks of his own struggles with God giving us great insight into the mercies, patience, of love of God.
