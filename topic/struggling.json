            "description": "God does not yell at us when we are struggling. It is His desire to see us \"strengthened in the inner man\" that we might walk \"in the Light\" as He is in the Light. This message is a rebuke to those who viciously thunder condemning messages to those struggling with sin. If listened to out of context, and with a wrong spirit, one might think Brother Wilkerson is saying that \"it doesn't matter if you sin.\"  He is not. Brother Wilkerson emphasizes the importance of delivering the FULL counsel of God - that although there is great \"severity\" if one does not surrender their life to Jesus, the Lord is also full of forgiveness and loving-kindness.  \"By lovingkindness and truth iniquity is atoned for, And by the fear of the LORD one keeps away from evil.\" Proverbs 16:6",
