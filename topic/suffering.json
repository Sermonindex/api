            "description": "\u201cBeloved, think it not strange concerning the fiery trial which is to try you, as though some strange thing happened unto you\u2026\u201d In the 30th message of this delightful, 34-part series on 1 Peter, A. W. Tozer observes three ways to bear adversity, from verses 12 to 19 of chapter 4. He then warns with Peter that \u201cthe Christian faith is not to provide immunity for wrongdoers\u2026 The deacon who doesn\u2019t pay his bills, the pastor who leaves the city owing debts, he can not, he dare not, hide these evils behind clerical immunity, or Christian immunity.\u201d Dr. Tozer concludes on a note of powerfully compelling evangelism, with masterful analogies to support Peter\u2019s exhortation that we \u201ccommit the keeping\u201d of our souls to a faithful creator. The sermon was delivered on June 27, 1954, at Southside Alliance Church in Chicago, Illinois. Its length is 28 minutes and 50 seconds.",

He takes the life of moses and shows how he choosed rather to suffer for the sake of Christ then enjoy the pleasures of sin for a short time. The same thing can be asked of the church today? There are many different tangents and convicting statements brought up as the spirit of God lead brother ravenhill to speak. This is a must listen.",

            "description": "When Paul was converted on the way to Damascus, God told Ananias that He would show Paul how much he was still to suffer for the name of Jesus. The sermon preached to Paul wasn't like so many of today's sermons, where people are told that they should come to Jesus to be happy, joyful, blessed, rich etc. That's why so many fall away. Of course those things could be added but that's not the reason you come to God neither the reason God saves you. God saves you that you might know Him and do His will, wherever He might lead. Someone asked one of the co-workers why he wasn't preaching a Gospel of love, blessedness and material prosperity. He answered that we preach the love of God as revealed in His Son Jesus who suffered and died for us on the cross because of our sin. He died so that we can be saved, do His will and lay down our lives for our fellowmen so that they too can be saved. The man then broke down and answered that he realizes for the first time that he has never been saved, but only followed after other men.",

This would be to partake of a supernatural life for the betterment of others. There are so many Christians today that follow Jesus for what they can get from Him. What about you will you refuse the fellowship of Christ for your own gain or will you take the low road and be spent for the cause of Christ?",

So also we must recognize that, being made as \u201cgods\u201d (John 10:34) we were given the free will to choose our present condition.  God is not to be blamed for the suffering we have chosen, neither is He to be blamed for the wreckage as a result of it.  Just as our Lord was, so also we need to be perfected through sufferings.  Suffering offers mankind the option to change.  We were cast out of eternity into time so that our decision could be corrected, and Jesus came and suffered for us so that we could be reconciled.",
