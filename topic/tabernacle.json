These are people who willingly offer themselves entirely to the Lord and expect nothing back but His presence. God dwells with ordinary people who concern themselves with the depth of the need and give all they have for the cause of Christ. The Tabernacle of David is a people who posses the heart of God and then take His heart to a fallen humanity.",
