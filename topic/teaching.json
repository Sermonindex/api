Was a Christian missionary, teacher, writer, and advocate of economic development in impoverished nations. A spiritual crisis during this period\u2014as he described two decades later in what is probably his best-known recorded teaching, \"Ten Shekels and a Shirt\"--left Reidhead with the conviction that much of evangelicalism had adopted utilitarian and humanistic philosophies contradictory to Biblical teaching. The end of all being, he came to believe, was not the happiness of man, but the glorification of God. This theme would recur throughout his later teaching.\r\n\r\nSince Mr. Reidhead's death in 1992, Bible Teaching Ministries, Inc. continues under the leadership of his wife, Marjorie, and daughter, Virginia Teitt, a dedicated Board, and the many people who have donated time and talent after being changed by God\u2019s Word through this message. The message of the Gospel is reaching an ever-widening audience all over the world.",

Brother Beasley was a powerful preacher of the Word of God who ministered mostly in southern Baptist churches in America. The Lord gave him a gift of faith to trust the Lord in impossible circumstances for God's glory. Even though Manley Beasley was not very old as we measure a life's span, he left behind a legacy of faith that was rarely seen in his generation. We pray that he will be honored and the Lord glorified by this attempt to share this legacy with all who would live a life of faith that is truly pleasing to God.\r\nThere came a time when Manley believed the Lord gave him a choice of complete healing or daily healing. Manley chose daily healing because for him it was an act of faith that each day the Lord had to heal him to the point that he could get out of bed. During those years there were more confinements in the hospital, as well as trips to Europe and revivals all over the United States. He led Bible Conferences, revivals, and shared his personal testimony with others dealing with illness.",
