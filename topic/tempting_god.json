            "description": "September 2, 2007 - What is the lesson we can learn from Ananias and Saphira? How could they think they could get the Holy Spirit to be a partaker of their lie? The enemy will bring a deception into our heart that says we can live in sin and hypocrisy because God does not mean what He says. We will stand before a Holy God and everything that is dark will be brought into the light of Christ. Jesus Christ has made every provision for us to live a life of purity. God wants to bury our sin and old nature so that we may live in the fear of God. We can choose to bury our sins today or our sins will bury us tomorrow. It time to get real with God!",
