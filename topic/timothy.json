I thought it appropriate to post this sermon on Timothy Ministry.com and am certain that if you take the time to listen you will be challenged, impacted and blessed. Brother Ravenhill speaks from years of Christian service and experience, and in many ways is like Paul exhorting the younger generations",

Yet he stayed true to God's call on his life prayed and pleading for true heaven sent revival. \r\n\r\n\"Those who know of Leonard Ravenhill recognize in him the religious specialist, the man sent from God to battle the priests of Baal on their own mountain top, to shame the careless priest at the altar, to face the false prophet, and to warn the people who are being led astray by him. \" - Tozer | \"Leonard Ravenhill was one of the few men I have ever known who was a true prophet.\" - David Wilkerson",
