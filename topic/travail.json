            "description": "Leonard Ravenhill draws from Hannah's travail how intercession is likened to spiritual \"pregnancy\" and birth.  As travail precedes the birth of a child, so birth pangs of desperate prayer precede revival.  Ravenhill masterfully draws upon the heroic exploits of prayer warriors Rees Howell, John Hyde, Praying Payson, E. M. Bounds, David Brainerd, A. W. Tozer, Murray M'Cheyne and Duncan Campbell.  \"An intercessor,\" says Ravenhill, \"is one who himself will take the load.\"  Will you?",
