We can either turn to the Lord and trust in His Word or charge God with \"Fatherly negligence\". God knows and cares!

            "description": "Nobody would believe a boat would go down with Jesus on it, would they? He stilled the water and calmed the storm for the disciples. But when Paul, and the prisoners were on the boat, bound for Rome, the storm tore the boat to pieces, and it went down. Paul had a word of hope from the Lord. All hell watched as God exposed every tool of the enemy, by sending them against Paul in this circumstance and his servant overcome. He kept him, and strengthened him. A wonderful message of encouragement for anyone in a hard trial. God prepares his people before the storm hits. And he takes them through it.",
