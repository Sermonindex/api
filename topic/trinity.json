            "description": "New Testament writers often mention together the three persons of the Godhead; prayer is preeminently but not exclusively to be addressed to the Father; fatherhood in the realm of deity is the pattern for fatherhood in the human realm; the greatest gifts to us from the Father are not things but the gift of His Son and His Spirit; we must honor the Spirit in his role of giving insight into the glory of Christ; the Spirit is already given to God's people as the first installment of the glory which is coming to them; we experience the discrepancy between what we are and the inestimable gift of the Spirit; a great deal of our ineffectiveness and unfaithfulness in the church is because we have not taken hold of this promise of the Spirit's operation.",
