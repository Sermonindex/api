We all have enemies we are facing but an obedient heart will open up our spirit to hear the shout of victory and freedom that only Christ can give us. Every Christian that is hungering for truth in this hour of time will have a cry produced in them by the Holy spirit and this cry will shout out to the Glory of God.",

He shares the truth that we are not to be scared of the devil or circumstances that come our way. He teaches that we can trust in our Heavenly Father and understand our position in Christ that we are given the power of the Holy Spirit. He encourages brethren to seek the true Baptism of the Holy Spirit and to be humble before the Lord all our days of our lives.",
