            "description": "J. Glyn Owen speaks about what true religion is. He speaks of the work of the Holy Spirit in the believer and not simply a holding to doctrinal viewpoints but the life of God through us, His power. God manifests His purpose through believers to see His salvation reach others. He shares that our experience of power with God is not a selfish personal experience but for God's greater purpose. Lastly he ties in the Gospel and shares that this is God's ultimate larger picture beyond our own personal experiences for ourselves.",
