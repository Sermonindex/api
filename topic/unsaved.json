            "description": "1 Peter 2:12 addresses the question A. W. Tozer declares every earnest Christian should ask: \u201cWhat should be my attitude toward the gentiles?\u201d As he sheds light on this subject, the pastor utilizes his superb observational skills to explain why the twice born love the presence of Christians, while the once born hate it. He also propounds an important point about what it takes to rightly divide the Word of Truth, and what it doesn\u2019t: \u201cGod never tells us anything that will enable us to get along without him.\u201d The 22nd sermon in a series of 34 concerning the first epistle of Peter, \u201cOur Walk in the Presence of the Unsaved\u201d was preached in Chicago, Illinois, on February 28, 1954. Its length is 35 minutes and 14 seconds.",

Jesus Christ wil write a testimony is us that wil cause men to be turned from hell to heaven.God will allow trials and seasons of loneliness to produce a depth of Christ in us. We must see the things that must be. We must see Jesus as the absolute victor over every enemy that comes against us. We must see Him as Faithful and True. He is King of King and Lord of Lords.",
