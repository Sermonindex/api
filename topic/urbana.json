Verwer is strongly encouraged by university movements and their effectiveness. \"The Holy Spirit is the CEO of all missionary work\", and in reaching people both at Urbana and through the audio produced there He is the one we work alongside. Interdenominational focus provides a great foundation, centered on the key truths of Scripture and laying aside the all else. Encouragement of the younger generation must be a key priority.",
