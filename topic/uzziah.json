            "description": "September 7, 2008 - We are living in a time when men and women who say they know God are pushing themselves into places that God has not ordained for them. When human effort and human reasoning take us to the end of ourselves God will visit us by His Holy Spirit and the ordinary man will do extraordinary things. Uzziah had God's vision and could see what God saw and the Lord made him to prosper until he became wise in his own eyes and put himself in the place of God. Not soon after that he was moved out and became a leper.",
