Willie Mullan had a religious conversion and from that time forward he decided he would strive to serve God.\r\n\r\n In 1953 Willie Mullan was called to Lurgan Baptist church, and in August of that year he commenced the work in Lurgan. One of his great accomplishments during this time was the Tuesday night Bible class. Every Tuesday night hundreds attended to hear the exposition of the Word. In 1957 William Hewitt and a team of helpers commenced the tape recordings of the Bible class. At least 1500 of these recordings remain until this day.",

It was the first of at least two messages that Pastor A. W. Tozer preached on this date, the other being \u201cThe New Year As God Sees It,\u201d which he delivered shortly before midnight. In the morning message, he focuses on 1 Corinthians 16:13-14, and upon the critical importance of staying watchful. A sure way to let one\u2019s guard down is to believe that the Devil does not exist. The pastor goes on to contemplate masculine and feminine virtues, and reads from what he considers to be the most disturbing chapter of the Bible, 1 Corinthians 13:1-7. He concludes with three things that will make us strong: 1) the Spirit\u2019s infilling; 2) the Lord\u2019s indwelling; 3) prayer and the Scriptures. The length of the sermon is 42 minutes and 15 seconds.",

He began a worldwide indigenous church-planting movement in India that eventually saw more than 10,000 local churches. Norman Grubb missionary statesman, author and teacher: \"In all my missionary experience I think these churches on their New Testament foundations are the nearest I have seen to a replica of the early church and a pattern for the birth and growth of the young churches in all the countries which we used to talk about as mission fields.\"\r\nLife of prayer.

Brother Beasley was a powerful preacher of the Word of God who ministered mostly in southern Baptist churches in America. The Lord gave him a gift of faith to trust the Lord in impossible circumstances for God's glory. Even though Manley Beasley was not very old as we measure a life's span, he left behind a legacy of faith that was rarely seen in his generation. We pray that he will be honored and the Lord glorified by this attempt to share this legacy with all who would live a life of faith that is truly pleasing to God.\r\nThere came a time when Manley believed the Lord gave him a choice of complete healing or daily healing. Manley chose daily healing because for him it was an act of faith that each day the Lord had to heal him to the point that he could get out of bed. During those years there were more confinements in the hospital, as well as trips to Europe and revivals all over the United States. He led Bible Conferences, revivals, and shared his personal testimony with others dealing with illness.",

One of the final traps of Satan on these Christians is to bite our hands and infuse us with his poisonous logic. It's always been Satan's desire to either have man withdraw his hand from being extended on God's behalf, or to distort the image of God's hand as He is revealed through man's hand. For those of us whose hands have been bitten by the very people God has sent us to help, God is saying DONT GIVE UP. God is calling us to a militant forgiveness so that God's hands will be extended through our hands to reach a fallen world. The weakness in our hands will be strengthened by the resurrected Hands of Jesus Christ.",
