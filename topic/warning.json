            "description": "Conrad Mbewe highlighted some important insights on leadership in Jeremiah 23. The failure of Israel\u2019s leaders led to their people\u2019s idolatry. Rather than Israel\u2019s leaders being a means of blessing, they were instead a means of judgment. But the God of the universe would not allow his agenda to be highjacked by ungodly leaders. God promised that he would send a Someone to lead His people, raising up a righteous Branch who would reign as a wise king. Who is this Person? You don\u2019t have to search far to find out who this Someone is: Jesus of Nazareth.",

Brother Beasley was a powerful preacher of the Word of God who ministered mostly in southern Baptist churches in America. The Lord gave him a gift of faith to trust the Lord in impossible circumstances for God's glory. Even though Manley Beasley was not very old as we measure a life's span, he left behind a legacy of faith that was rarely seen in his generation. We pray that he will be honored and the Lord glorified by this attempt to share this legacy with all who would live a life of faith that is truly pleasing to God.\r\nThere came a time when Manley believed the Lord gave him a choice of complete healing or daily healing. Manley chose daily healing because for him it was an act of faith that each day the Lord had to heal him to the point that he could get out of bed. During those years there were more confinements in the hospital, as well as trips to Europe and revivals all over the United States. He led Bible Conferences, revivals, and shared his personal testimony with others dealing with illness.",
