Abraham asked his servant to go and find a wife for His son. The servant asked if he should take his son there if the woman refuses to follow him but Abraham solemnly warned him to never do that. Jesus taught us to pray that God's will be done (Matthew 6:9-13). Jesus also said that those who do the will of His Father are His brother and sister and mother (Matthew 12:50). That should fill us with joy and also help us understand why those who do not do His will deserve hell indeed.",

This holiness and glory must be manifested in your life, whether you're a child, teenager, parent or grandparent. If you as a pastor or father in the house wants godly authority over your congregation or children you must have intimate fellowship with God, daily. Abraham had the most intimate relationship with God; and God testified of him that He knew him. A congregation reveals what a pastor is like and children reveal what the parents are like. If you have truly met with God, your one desire will be God's will, and you will live for Him, regardless of your circumstances. Paul was persecuting the church, when the Lord met him on the road to Damascus. His life was changed forever. Within three days he was filled with God's Spirit.",
