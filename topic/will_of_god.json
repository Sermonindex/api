Bill Mcleod was the pastor of Ebenezer Baptist Church for many years where ultimately God sent revival to that affecting much of Canada. He had a passion to know God and His word. Paul Washer said he was one of the most godly men he met in Canada.\r\n\r\nBill Mcleod had been praying and had his congregation praying for revival for years. On, October 17, 1971, God in His sovereignty came in revival. Without human means or explanation, the revival spread from church to church, community to community, city to city, and not long after from province to province. This has become known as the 1971 Canadian Revival movement.",

Abraham asked his servant to go and find a wife for His son. The servant asked if he should take his son there if the woman refuses to follow him but Abraham solemnly warned him to never do that. Jesus taught us to pray that God's will be done (Matthew 6:9-13). Jesus also said that those who do the will of His Father are His brother and sister and mother (Matthew 12:50). That should fill us with joy and also help us understand why those who do not do His will deserve hell indeed.",

If you as a pastor or father in the house wants godly authority over your congregation or children you must have intimate fellowship with God, daily. Abraham had the most intimate relationship with God; and God testified of him that He knew him. A congregation reveals what a pastor is like and children reveal what the parents are like. If you have truly met with God, your one desire will be God's will, and you will live for Him, regardless of your circumstances.

Was a Christian missionary, teacher, writer, and advocate of economic development in impoverished nations. A spiritual crisis during this period\u2014as he described two decades later in what is probably his best-known recorded teaching, \"Ten Shekels and a Shirt\"--left Reidhead with the conviction that much of evangelicalism had adopted utilitarian and humanistic philosophies contradictory to Biblical teaching. The end of all being, he came to believe, was not the happiness of man, but the glorification of God. This theme would recur throughout his later teaching.\r\n\r\nSince Mr. Reidhead's death in 1992, Bible Teaching Ministries, Inc. continues under the leadership of his wife, Marjorie, and daughter, Virginia Teitt, a dedicated Board, and the many people who have donated time and talent after being changed by God\u2019s Word through this message. The message of the Gospel is reaching an ever-widening audience all over the world.",
