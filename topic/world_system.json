            "description": "There is a distinction between \u201cloving the world\u201d and not being \u201cof the world,\u201d that believers must make.  We are not called to hide from the world, but rather we are to be in it while being completely freed from its clutches, and free from its systemic tyranny over our lives.  This sermon shows how, if you use worldly methods to attract people to your fellowships, worldly people are all you will attract.  Brother Zac uses a flurry of scriptures to blow away any notion that it is acceptable to God to still be of this present evil world.",

God called brother Zac Poonen to a new work early on in his Christian experience. The movement is now called Christian Fellowship Churches where the New Covenant of New Testament Christianity is clearly preached. \r\n\r\nBrother Zac Poonen has written 25 books most of them being on the deeper Christian life. Many of these have been translated into a number of languages and have been circulated widely around the world. He clearly and passionately shares the  narrow way of Christian discipleship that is neglected by so many modern preachers.",
