            "description": "There is a distinction between \u201cloving the world\u201d and not being \u201cof the world,\u201d that believers must make.  We are not called to hide from the world, but rather we are to be in it while being completely freed from its clutches, and free from its systemic tyranny over our lives.  This sermon shows how, if you use worldly methods to attract people to your fellowships, worldly people are all you will attract.  Brother Zac uses a flurry of scriptures to blow away any notion that it is acceptable to God to still be of this present evil world.",
