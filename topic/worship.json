God doesn\u2019t need us, but He wants us. Though man possesses a natural desire to worship, he wishes to worship any way he feels like worshiping. The God who wants us to worship Him, however, has decreed how we are to do so. Pastor Tozer details three kinds of worship that God outrightly rejects: 1) \u201cCain worship:\u201d worship without atonement. 2) \u201cSamaritan worship:\u201d accepting what one wants to believe, neglecting what one doesn\u2019t, and adding what\u2019s not there at all. 3) \u201cNature worship:\u201d mistaking worship of God\u2019s creation for worship of God himself. John 4:24 describes the kind of worship that God gladly accepts. Psalm 45:11 and 2 Thessalonians 1:10 are also texts for this 39-minute sermon.",

It is a message on the prayer, praise and worship that goes before the Lord.  If you have a fear of conviction or a desire to remain lukewarm or cold, this is not the message for you. This sermon examines the \"dark side of prayer\" -- that is, God's response to prayer from impure hearts and unclean hands. Prayer from an unrepentant and selfish heart will produce judgment rather than stopping it. The starting point for the message is God's judgment upon Nadab and Abihu in Leviticus 10 for offering \"strange fire\" on the altar of incense. This is a must-listen in this day of frequent calls to prayer -- prayer without repentance will do nothing but hasten judgment.",

We pray that he will be honored and the Lord glorified by this attempt to share this legacy with all who would live a life of faith that is truly pleasing to God.\r\nThere came a time when Manley believed the Lord gave him a choice of complete healing or daily healing. Manley chose daily healing because for him it was an act of faith that each day the Lord had to heal him to the point that he could get out of bed. During those years there were more confinements in the hospital, as well as trips to Europe and revivals all over the United States. He led Bible Conferences, revivals, and shared his personal testimony with others dealing with illness.",
