            "description": "Worshippers aren't made in good times, or during victories. They are made in dark and stormy trials. Jacob had lived a tumultous life, with one trial after another, yet when he was old and dying, he leaned on his staff and worshipped, saying his bad times had been few, as he reflected on the faithfulness of God. God had brought him through so many things, and he will be faithful to us, too",
