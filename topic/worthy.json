            "description": "In this sermon, Wilkerson teaches us on the importance of what comes out of our mouth.  Paul writing to the Philippians says that we should let every word that comes out of our mouths be worthy of the gospel of Christ.  When one ponders that and then thinks of things that they speak\u2026  we are all going to be convicted of our own words.",
