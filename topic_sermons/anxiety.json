        "description": "Anxiety is reacting to something in life with fear because you feel out of control. Dr. Stanley cites Philippians 4:6-7 to show that anxiety is unnecessary if you put your trust in God in times of trouble and cry out for His help. By focusing on God, Dr. Stanley says, troubles just seem to disintegrate and there is an awesome sense of peace when you trust God to be in control of the situation.",

        "description": "This passage addresses anxiety, but at its core it is really teaching about values, or priorities. When we worry, we are showing what we value and how much we trust God to care for us. Every disciple of Jesus should have a \u00c2\u201cpriority target,\u00c2\u201d with a black circle in the center representing the rule of God over their hearts. Everything outside that center should be prioritized by the King of kings as He shows us what is right. Whatever we are tempted to worry about will be provided by our heavenly Father.",
