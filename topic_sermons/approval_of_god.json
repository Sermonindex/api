The devil is out there, yes, but sometimes we blame him for everything when in reality it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s us who are the problem! Choosing inconveniences, difficulties, and the rough road because we love Him is such a wonderful thing to do. The more we come to know Jesus, it should be our fuel to do and tell others who do not know the Lord about Him-His love is that great!",
