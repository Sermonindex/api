        "description": "Much error that comes into Christianity is not because people teach error but because one truth is magnified so much at the expense of another truth.  Zac Poonen concentrates on six areas where we need to be balanced, the first two expounded in this sermon: 1) faith and works, and 2) love for God and love for man.",

        "description": "If we mix up the biblical priorities between our personal life and our church life--the Lord Jesus, then family, then church\/ministry--we will go astray.  Brother Zac encourages seeking to build fellowship with radical, wholehearted disciples while being available to serve others.  What about the right emphasis on evangelism and discipleship making?  Gain practical insight in these areas that often trip people up in their Christian walk!",

        "description": "Verwer explains that balance is not compromise but is holding various strong scriptural truths in the light of other strong scriptural truths. He lists many tangents that need to be avoided. Although we must \"not be nibblers of the possible but grabbers of the possible\" this needs to be held in balance with common sense. There are many tensions that need to be maintained between seeming opposites in the journey to being more Christ-like.",
