        "description": "Duncan Campbell preached this strong word on the baptism in the Holy Spirit at a camp meeting in America in the 1960's.  \"You can't work up revival, but you can do the digging\"--a breaking through the dry crust of our hearts and removing the 'stones', anything that would hinder a consecrated life to God.  The sermon is alive with vivid revival accounts, as with its sister sermon, \"Lacking One Thing\".",

        "description": "This is a powerful sermon on \"drinking the cup\" and baptism of the holy spirit in a way far different from the meaning that is often heard. It's a long sermon but it's worth the hour. Luke 12:49-50 \"I have a baptism...\" \"I am come to send fire on earth.\" Ravenhill speak in this video of the Baptism of the Holy Spirit and the Baptism of Christ sufferings. This lecture was spoken at last days ministries to a crowd of students. This is a very convicting and passionate video of Ravenhill it is highly recommended.",
