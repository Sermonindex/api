He wil keep us from the things we ve asked for until there is a cry from the depths of our spirit that will bring back to God the very thing we are asking Him for. God waits for this cry that comes from the barreness of our souls and He wil come at His appointed time and bring forth fruit that wil cahnge a generation ang bring Him glory.",
