        "description": "Why are people discontent, even though they are saved by the grace of God? What shackles are binding their behavior? In 1 Corinthians 13:11, Paul helps us understand the reasons for our discontent which often originates from the child still within us. Dr. Stanley discusses those childish things that may adversely influence our lives as an adult, including believing you must measure up to another's expectations, the need for instant gratification, and (believe it or not) throwing temper tantrums.",
