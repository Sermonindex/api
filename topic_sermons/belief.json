If you are a child of God, and you are walking around plagued by indecision, confusion, fear, insecurity or despair, this message is needful. When we don't appropriate the Word of God that we hear, and believe it, darkness of the mind comes. Do you put yourself down, feeling you'll never measure up to God's expectation? There is help for you. God wants to help.",

Or do we get so caught up in ourselves that the billions who have never heard of Jesus doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t break our hearts. Jesus sacrificed Himself for us. What we can do though is show Him how much we love Him in our everyday life, by obeying, listening, and doing what His Word tells us to do.",

        "description": "April 26, 2009 - It is so important for Christians to be fully persuaded of what they believe. We must be fixed on the fact that nothing can separate us from the love of God, and that God is a rewarder of those who diligently seek Him. It is time for the Church of Jesus Christ to rise up and pray in the power of the Holy Ghost. The Holy Spirit is the revealer of truth. He makes the truth of God's Word go from our head into our heart. Through the fires and through the floods God's people will stand in the Grace of God.",

God has intertwined His life with His church and it doesn\u2019t matter how far we have fallen we are never out of God's reach. Those who are in Christ will not be overcome by the enemy. The serpent will not take us but rather we will take him up and whatever death the enemy has caused us to swallow it wiil not harm us. God will fill us with His power and His life will overflow with healing through us onto a sin sick world. These are the signs that will follow those who choose to believe.",
