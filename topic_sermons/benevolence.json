Abuse, abandonment, neglect, starvation, no school, some are even abandoned as infants.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d Children need love, they need someone to nurture them and show them they are loved. Our Bridge of Hope centers in Asia do this exact thing. God is doing so much with what we have established but there are still so many kids in Asia who need love and to be taken in.",
