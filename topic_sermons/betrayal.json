        "description": "The Lord in the Upper Room, in speaking to a group of 'preachers' says \"one of you shall betray me.\" In this Christ was making a personal application of Psalm 41:9 \"Yea, mine own familiar friend, in whom I trusted, which did eat of my bread, hath lifted up his heel against me.\" This was a great exposure, not only of the traitor Judas but of... 1. The Saints Sensitive Heart (they all said \"is it I?\") 2. The Social Gospel (all the teaching and example of Christ is not enough to save the soul and sin is not in the fact that Judas did not follow protocol but that his heart was not right) 3. The Sinner's Hypocrisy (Judas has become a proverb for treachery and betrayal, but Christ exposes the heart).",

        "description": "Every child of God will have to endure trials of suffering and betrayal if they will be mightily used by God. God will allow us to experience these afflictions and use them as a doorway into fellowship with Him so that we are conformable to the death of Jesus Christ. When we are betrayed it is a pain like no other. The devil will do his best to keep us behind the gates of betrayal so that we keep a distance from people and vow never to trust again. We know we are passing through these gates when we choose to forgive and begin to have a strong desire to be reconciled with our betrayer. We will come to a place of undersatnding that God has been in control all along and the life of Christ that is imparted into us through this experience will become provision for someone else.",
