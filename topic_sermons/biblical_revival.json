        "description": "What does it mean to live in continuous revival? Many people think living in revival means an exceptional spiritual experience reserved for a few extraordinary people, but in reality, the experience that we call revival is what God wants every one of His children to have. Walking with God, having a clear conscience, and being filled with the power of the Spirit is supposed to be normal.",

        "description": "\"We stand in great danger of being satisfied.\"  Denny Kenaston's heart was burdened to have real revival and to motivate further prayer for it.  He warned against dead orthodoxy (correct doctrine without life) and even enjoying God's blessings so as to not pursue God's best.  The inspiration for the address came from Duncan Campbell's \"When God Stepped Down\", an accounting of the amazing Hebrides revival around 1952.",

God has recorded these for our instruction, inspiration, and also that we would cry out to Him to do it again. Bro Denny reviews the recorded revival of David's time, and and also of King Josiah's reign. He also recounts a few examples from more recent history.",
