        "description": "Rev. Paul Washer is an itinerant preacher and the General Director for HeartCry Missionary Society. Ingrid played excerpts of a message by Paul Washer that was preached to 5,000 young people at a Southern Baptist conference. Ingrid pointed out that the message was not well received. Why is that? Today, Christian youth are exposed to many entertainment based Bible messages. This is in direct contrast to Reverend Washer's message. He communicated that far too many people believe that even though they love so many things in the world, they're saved because at some point in their life they prayed a prayer and supposedly \"accepted\" Christ into their life. Reverend Washer debunks this notion of split allegiance. He explains how we need to learn how to love the things that God loves and hate the things that God hates, recognizing that the only reason we are saved, if in fact we are, is because Jesus, on the Cross, took upon himself the wrath of the Father; wrath that would otherwise have fallen on us.",
