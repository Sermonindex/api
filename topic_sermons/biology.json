        "description": "Wilder-Smith discusses the necessity to recognize the logos of information within matter.  Without the direction put into us from the outside we will all go to pieces.  We also ought to receive the logos from God every day in terms of his direction, for if God implanted all matter with his logos signature, so also he can govern our lives through His word.  We ought then remain devoted to him in our lives and families.",
