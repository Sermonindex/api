Given are reasons why our former life and that of unredeemed sinners is pure foolishness, and why it holds such power over us. Then goes on to explain the preciousness of the blood of Jesus and just how precious it is.",

        "description": "The life is in the blood. Blood is so complex that even the scientists struggle to fully understand it. For example when you're cut, your body immediately reacts and sends the white blood cells to fight the infection. The dead white blood cells are then expelled as puss. In the same way the Blood of Christ cleanses us from all unrighteousness to counter any poison of sin that enters. The blood is like petrol that allows your body to function. The other members of the body remains in its place, but the blood is present right through your body. The blood also carries oxygen throughout your body. It also gets rid of impurities and acts like a refuse remover. We speak so glibly about the Blood of Christ, little realising what it does. It brings us life and that's why the devil hates it.",

Pastor Hession shows that it was not enough for the blood of the lamb to be spilled it had to be applied and sprinkled just as we need to be covered in the blood of the Lamb who is the Lord Jesus, slain from the foundations of the world.  And when God sees the blood He will 'passover' which here in the hebrew conveys a sense of God standing over us in a protective way.  We also see that we cannot pin our own works to the doorposts of our hearts but on the blood of the Lamb.",

How often though when He looks upon us He sees sin frechly commited and how it must grieve Him.  Charles Finey said that 'God looks upon sin as persisting until it is repented of,' and when He sses this sin He is unable to defend us like He would desire to because of our unrepentent state. But, Hallelujah, when He sees the blood He will stand over us and protect us a face of anything that comes against whether it be sin Hell or the devil himself.  The answer to our sin is not more good works but the blood of the Lord Jesus.",
