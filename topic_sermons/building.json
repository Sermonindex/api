She worked herself up emotionally and eventually she shouted (some Christians like to pray louder and louder and work themselves up to a crechendo, thinking that by their sheer volume they will be heard of God. They fail to distinguish between the soul and spirit). An owl in the tree was startled by her crying and let out \"whooo\". She replied, \"anybody, Lord\". Don't be obsessed with marriage lest you end up with a washout of a husband. Let God be your first priority.",
