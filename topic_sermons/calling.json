They will fight against you, but will not prevail.\" Then, these amazing words. \"Speak, lest I confound you before the people\". No man was more sure of his calling, and God called him to speak of destruction and desolation, but if he should doubt, he shall be confounded. I.e. If you trust me you will never be confounded, but if you will doubt your call from Me, I'll confound you before men. This is crucial in today's world. I have been preaching for over 50 years, but still remember the day, time and place where God called me. I have never once doubted that call.

He calls us to stand between the sinfulness of society and the life of a merciful savior. God is looking for you to get into the prayer closet with His promises and touch His heart. The Lord looks for those who would entreat Him like a son or daughter and convince Him to show mercy before judgment.",

Some are quite awake physically but fast asleep spiritually. There are those who think Christmas is a time to booze, or a time to give way to their passions. Others put up beautiful decorations, but they don't know what Christmas is about. But at Christmas we celebrate the birth of the Son of our Heavenly Father into this world, who became man. He wasn't born in a palace, but in a smelly stable with animals.",

        "description": "Paul Washer sometimes expounds a number of different (but often related) topics in his sermons, and this message is no exception. Preaching in Denmark, he opens with a plea for men who have a zeal for the Lord\u2019s house, who will stand up and be counted, and will seize the opportunities for preaching the gospel while they exist. Moving on to Chapter 1 of Mark\u2019s gospel, he shows how demanding life can be for the zealous man of God, as exemplified in the ministry of Jesus Christ himself. If the Son of God could not live on earth without prayer and secret communion with his Father, how much less can we. He was never too busy to pray; nor should we be. Everything we are in public, is formed by what we are in private when we are alone with God, says Mr Washer; and he then goes on to use the Luke 18 passage to expound the topic of persevering prayer, showing both how and why we should endure in prayer, how God delights in it, and what it can achieve.
