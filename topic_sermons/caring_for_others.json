        "description": "(preached: Dec. 14, 2003) Starting with Timothy, and going through other scriptures, believers are exhorted to care one for another, and fight the good fight. When God sends someone to you who needs encouragement, lifting up will you be able to take time to support those who are falling down? Will you be able to stand up against the devil for your brothers and sisters in the church? Don't be willing to let them go. Hate it when you see the devil gain the advantage. Jesus left the flock for the one. He left the 99 for the one. When you see it, you pray, and you fast for them. You intercede, encourage, lift up. Support. This is the heart of God for his people and this is how he wants them to love one another. Ask God to give you the discernment to see the needs of others around you. To look past your needs and problems to those around you.",
