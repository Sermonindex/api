All the faithful are crucified with Christ through all of the ages. Once a believer is regenerated the old man should be hardly recognized, and must not reign! Those crucified with Christ have been united in the likeness of His death. Only then will one be united in the likeness of His death and the likeness of His resurrection. He who has died has been freed from sin and the old life is dead. To be crucified with Christ means to be changed.",
