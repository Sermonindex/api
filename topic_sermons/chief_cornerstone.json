        "description": "Christ\u2019s people are the living stones of God\u2019s temple. On January 31, 1954, A. W. Tozer preached \u201cThe Chief Cornerstone and Us Cornerstones,\u201d in Chicago, Illinois. It is the 19th message in a 34-part study of Peter\u2019s first epistle. We already know that the Bible is true; the big question is whether it is true in us. From 1 Peter 2:3-5, Pastor Tozer examines the terms, \u201ctasted,\u201d and \u201clively stones,\u201d and observes that Christians come out of the world, come away from the old life, come unto Christ, and come together. Drawing nearer to Jesus Christ is what draws Christians nearer to each other. The pastor also warns that we can get the gifts of God and then forget the God that gives. God gives himself in every gift, and it is God himself who matters more than all other gifts. The recording length is 38 minutes and 41 seconds.",
