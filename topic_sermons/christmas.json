        "description": "I wonder what they had to tell when they got to heaven.  I wonder what they had to tell, because there were other angels up there waiting and wondering what in the world happened when Jesus Christ the Son of God came among men.  What happened?  Oh, I think there must have been real sadness in heaven.  \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Why, they were all asleep\u00e2\u20ac\u201dthe whole city of the King.  They were all asleep.  We couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t even wake them up with our trumpets.  We had to go out into the field where the shepherds were watching.  They were awake.  They were awake\u00e2\u20ac\u201dthey heard us.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d I heard an Alliance preacher say that angels don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t sing.  I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know.  All our songs talk about angels singing.  But the Bible doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t say that.  They talked; they had a message\u00e2\u20ac\u201da very wonderful message, but nobody there to listen to it, nobody there to be interested.  \u00e2\u20ac\u0153He came unto His own\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6\u00e2\u20ac\u009d\u00e2\u20ac\u201dwhat a fact; how very wonderful: this entire Old Testament was a preparation for the coming of the King to this earth, and was intended to prepare hearts to be ready to receive Him.  But when He came, there was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153no form nor comliness that we should desire Him.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d  My goodness, who in the world would have looked for Him in a manger\u00e2\u20ac\u201din a manager in a stable?",

Tozer draws seven features of wonder and mystery from First John 1:1-10, as he contemplates 1) the wonder of \u201cthat eternal life;\u201d 2) the wonder of life manifested; 3) the wonder of light; 4) the mystery of iniquity; 5) the wonder of sin forgiven when confessed; 6) the wonder of cleansing from unrighteousness; 7) the wonder of communion. \u201cThe Theology of Christmas\u201d was recorded in Chicago, Illinois, probably in December of 1957 or 1958. It is 38 minutes and 35 seconds in length.",
