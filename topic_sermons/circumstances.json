        "description": "This message is about the need to not depend on circumstances in our lives staying the same and putting our future in the hands of God. Carter points out that a Christians life of self denial involves continuous change and that it is important not to rely on past or present people, places, or things. We go from glory to glory and there is a constant need for change. When Christians refuse to change, they stay in secure places and do things even in worship that that are the way they have always done them. Churches that that once had fire can become dead by not changing. Carter went to Rev 2 with the church of Ephesus as an example of a church without change leaving it's first love for familiarity. Carter used the example of Peter getting out of the boat to walk on water of a person who gets away from the security of familiar circumstances to follow the Lord's bidding. Hebrews 13;14 Was quoted early by Carter, \"We have no continuing city\".",
