        "description": "2 Cor. 13:14 is the passage featured. Bro. Wilkerson carefully explains why the Holy Ghost was sent, and how to commune with him. It is much more simple than most think, yet much more vital to allow this communion, even hungrily seek it, than we realize. Jesus would not have asked the Father to send us a Comforter he knew we wouldn't need. We need to know why he was sent, why he dwells in us, and allow him to do what the Father sent him to do.",

The bread and wine are not only signs but also seals of our communion with Christ; this text gives four basic characteristics of those who are in communion with Christ: 1) they are called by God the Father into relationship to Christ, by an efficacious summons that initiates our possession of salvation, so that we belong to Christ; 2) they are called to be saints, everyone united to Christ by faith is a saint, consecrated to God and pure in character. What are our controlling ambitions with respect to holiness? 3) They exhibit obedience of faith, an enduring commitment to Christ as absolute Lord, whole-souled devotion that brings every thought captive to Christ; 4) they are beloved of God, who delights in those who reflect his own perfections, by nature we have nothing but God in sovereign grace makes us after his image in holiness. We must not drag down these standards of eligibility for communion which have been set by God.",
