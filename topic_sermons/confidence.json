Everybody lies.  \u00e2\u20ac\u0153All men are liars.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d  You might as well put it down in your notebook.  \u00e2\u20ac\u0153All men are liars,\u00e2\u20ac\u009d but there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s One that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not a liar.  There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s One in Whom you can safely confide, and you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re commanded to have confidence in God.  The Bible says, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Cast not away therefore your confidence, which hath great recompence of reward.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d  But now, my God, who are You going to reward?  Whom are You going to honor like that?  Who do You want to have confidence in You?  Me?  Poor weak mortal\u00e2\u20ac\u201dpoor weak thing that cannot have confidence in himself!",
