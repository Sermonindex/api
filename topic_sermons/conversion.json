        "description": "\u201cI am not going to waste any tears on anybody who comes whimpering to me for sympathy because people think he\u2019s strange from following Christ. \u2026 The moment it can\u2019t be said of a Christian, \u2018He\u2019s different,\u2019 he has disgraced his testimony and sold out his faith.\u201d A. W. Tozer explores 1 Peter 4:1-5 with ironclad logic, tempered by his distinctive spark of congenial wit. He contemplates the meaning of \u201cstrange,\u201d defines a Christian and the Christian perspective of time, and extols the virtues of a silent reply. Pastor Tozer\u2019s remarkable mind is at its best in this 28th message of his 34-part series on the first epistle of Peter. \u201cAfter Conversion, the Remainder of Your Life Should Be Different\u201d was recorded on June 6, 1954, in Chicago, Illinois. Its length is 23 minutes and 55 seconds.",
