        "description": "A philosopher searches for truth inside his own head, a scientist searches outside in nature, and neither finds the whole truth, but only shattered fragments. A. W. Tozer intimates, \u201cMy friend, the wisest man in the world is the man who knows the most about God.\u201d Only as things are seen from the sanctuary may they truly be seen in focus. Through 1 Peter 2:17 and a loving exegesis of Psalm 104, Pastor Tozer illuminates two of \u201cthe five things the Christian should do if he is to grow in grace and in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ:\u201d 1) Venerate all things; 2) Honor all men; 3) Love all Christians; 4) Fear God; 5) Honor the authorities. \u201cVenerate All God\u2019s Creation\u201d is the 24th message in a 34-part study of Peter\u2019s first epistle. Recorded on March 14, 1954, in Chicago, Illinois, the sermon is 40 minutes and 34 seconds in length.",

        "description": "Marvelous is Gods creative genius as you look at His creation. God has built in instincts and traits (micro-systems) so that animals behave and do things which really wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be possible through evolution. How great a God we serve, how wise in His creation surely the creation shows forth His handiwork. Elohim (plural) trinity of God. V26 let us make man in our (plural, trinity) image. If God created me with a capacity of choice unless I had the ability to choose. So freedom of choice is given to men and the opposite of what good is given so people can choice what is actually good. God influences choices because He loves and cares for us, but we have the right to not choose God. God will not force His choice upon us, He is an gentleman. In pictures of Christ there is an attempt to define Him in form. It is more God honoring according to the commandment of not making an graven image of God to not make any image of Jesus Christ. Gods will for original man is to be fruitful and multiply and to subdue the earth. All the animals at that point lived off the grasses and vegetation, there was no carnivous animals. God rested meaning that He was not exhausted but that the creation was completed. This chapter gives the first look at creation, but the next chapter gives an more detailed version of the creation of man. And God is revealed in a different name: Jehovah. This different name of God curtails the relationship between God and man. What is important is what did God say not who did He say it through.",

God created man as His crowning glory. Today the theory of evolution (otherwise known as macro evolution) is taught in the public schools; but it is only a fairytale for grownups and has contributed nothing towards science. The simplest living organism's design is vastly more complex than the finest swiss watch, yet evolutionists claim that it formed by blind chance.",

Humans are the only thing that God created that has the ability to resist God. God is always speaking! His voice is above everything on earth. Nothing can drown out the voice of God. When God speaks He creates a pathway into His life. When we receive His Word by faith miracles happen and our lives begin to declare His glory.",

He quotes numerous Christian sources from mainstream Christianity to show how they have kowtowed to the world by shoving \u201cmillions of years\u201d into the scriptures through eisogesis.   He points out how no Christian ever believed the world was created in more than six days until the seventeen to eighteen hundreds, when the world told Christianity what they were allowed to believe about the word.  However...God gave man dominion over the world\u2026not the word.",
