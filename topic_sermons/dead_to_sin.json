        "description": "Before we surrendered our lives to Christ we were dead in our sin. The only way to be free from this sin is to die to our old way of living. Jesus Christ died for us and when we came to Christ we were baptized in this death. The Bible says, \"he that is dead in Christ is free from the dominion of sin.\" The evidence of this death is that we are not controlled by sin any longer. It doesn't mean we don't have struggles or failures, it means that these things no longer govern our lives. From the time we are born again our whole life is about the funeral of our old nature and the birth of the new man that God is making us to be. The true Christian spends their whole life preaching their own funeral.",
