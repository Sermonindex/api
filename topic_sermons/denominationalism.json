        "description": "Denominationalism is a prison for many and the spirit of this many need to be freed from. This sermon points out how the denominational spirit is the same that impelled the Pharisee's to emphasize their spiritual purity due to their Abrahamic pedigree. Brother Zac makes a strong case for the building of local bodies that are not connected through denominational structures that have leadership that use and abuse the sheep, but are overseen by truly spiritual brothers.",
