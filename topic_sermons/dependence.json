He says \u00e2\u20ac\u0153the more someone is naturally gifted is the more he or she must go through death to self and pride.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d The Lord doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t care about our positions or how great we are at something; He cares about our hearts. Do we do things as to the Lord, or because we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re good at it? Christ came so humble and that is exactly what we need to do. Walk in humility all the time, and depend on the Lord through every circumstance \u00e2\u20ac\u201c good or bad.",
