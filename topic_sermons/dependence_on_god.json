        "description": "Carter Conlon preached this powerful message in the year 2003 at Times Square Church. No matter your struggle - God will NOT fail you as you trust Him in everything. God will always be faithful the scripture says. God has made covenant with the Church as he did with Israel and His promises are sure. He is a sure rock and fortress in our times of trouble. May God bring us to total dependence on Christ and His work.",
