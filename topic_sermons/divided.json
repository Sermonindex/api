        "description": "Charles Spurgeon said in a 1859 sermon that the main fault with the Church was that it is not only divided \u00e2\u20ac\u0153somewhat\u00e2\u20ac\u009d in its creeds and ordinances, it is also \u00e2\u20ac\u0153somewhat\u00e2\u20ac\u009d divided in its heart. When Christians no longer can love each other unconditionally, when divisions in doctrine become so acid that we cannot cooperate, when we can no longer extend the hand of fellowship to those with whom we disagree, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153then, indeed, is the Church of God found faulty.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d",
