        "description": "We who profess the name of Christ are defining him to a world that is lost by whatever we say or do. The world sees a church splintered by division, into numerous denominations and differences in their interpretation of scripture. Too many refuse to fellowship with one another because of their differences. Their is no scripture to condone such division and denominational loyalty. There is one Lord, one faith, and one baptism. A convicting message on dealing with our prejudices. By the way believers live their lives they represent Christ to the world who watches with suspicion. Peter had a hard time dealing with the acceptance of the Gentiles, and learning to share God with them. The Jews had long held the belief God was theirs alone. The Lord revolutionized Peter's and the apostles' thinking when he gave the Holy Ghost to the Gentiles, too. May he revolutionize ours as well. This is one of the best messages on unity in the Body of Christ, and the need for it, ever preached by anyone.",

        "description": "This message can be greatly misinterpreted if one does not know Wilkerson's teachings. It is about division in the Body of Christ. We should not be so quick to judge one another for doctrinal issues that are not pertaining to \"life and godliness.\" This message is NOT intended to make people think they should overlook clear doctrinal error. It is, rather, a message to those who might be becoming a bit \"self-righteous\" in judging others for things that Jesus never considered important.",
