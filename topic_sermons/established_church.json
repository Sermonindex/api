        "description": "Brother EA shares his heart towards revival in the nation of America and the sad state of the formal established denominational churches. He shows how God works outside the box in a New Thing and that God always raises up preachers to minister His truth whether or not they are accepted by the masses. This is an important message to bring many to repentance and to support and proclaim the gospel in its purity and power in our day.",
