        "description": "Art Katz speaks on the very important issue of loving the truth and weighing such with modern revival movements where experience is elevated beyond the truth and God it represents. He gives a prophetic cautionary word towards the Toronto blessing as a new supposed revival movement and gives Biblical truth to help us navigate these muddied waters. Do you have a love of the truth? Loving the God of truth?",
