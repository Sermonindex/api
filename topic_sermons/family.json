I believe it to be preached in the 60's and the recording was taken from a Record LP so there will be some background noise of the record due to quality. In this message wilkerson addresses the deplorable situation in American homes and gives an urgent call for people to wake up and start to really live as a family should live. This message is counter-cultural and against the spirit of the age of progress and technology, simplier times are and were better. I am sure many families will take much of the simple application into everyday life.",
