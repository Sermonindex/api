        "description": "Emanuel Esh examines principles from the life of King David, how externally he had many victories but suffered various defeats in his home life--a loss of discernment and authority.  Esh drives home the importance of parents (particularly the father) drawing clear boundaries and being firm and consistent.  In a society where children often rule the home, this is a sober warning of the consequences of parental neglect in the lives of children in years to come--when it may be too late.",
