        "description": "A. W. Tozer strikes a blow against fear. With searing eloquence and sober erudition, Dr. Tozer sets forth an extremely encouraging message for all of Christ\u2019s servants and missionaries. He starts by taking us through Romans 8:33-39 to underscore the bold exhortation of 1 Peter 3:13. Nothing can harm a good man! \u201cNothing can debase his quality, nothing can reduce his dimensions, nothing can prevent the fulfillment of his destiny, nothing can block the accomplishment of his appointed task, and nothing can lower his value before God and the universe!\u201d With this May 16, 1954 sermon, Pastor Tozer marked one year from the beginning of his 34-part series on Peter\u2019s first epistle. \u201cWho is He That Will Harm You?\u201d is the 27th message, preached at Southside Alliance Church in Chicago, Illinois. It is 38 minutes, 43 seconds in length.",

True worshippers will not give into fear but will have a inner thankfulness of God's provision and care no matter what circumstances they are in.",

God hides himself from the casual seeker. When life is going well we lose our passion for the Lord, our hunger. Sometimes God allows circumstances in our lives to expose how needy for him that we really are.  Just like in the life of Samson God will bring about circumstances that reveal that we are not as strong as we think we are. The strongest men realize their need for Christ and His strength and how much we need Him and his grace.",

God is more powerful then any enemy that comes our way. Magnifying the enemy over the greatness of our God is saying in our hearts that there is no God. There is a point in our lives when we have to face our fears and believe God to deliver us. God has already defeated every enemy we will ever face in Jesus Christ. We must understand the enemy is not defying us, but rather he is attempting to defy the Christ in us who has purchased us with His own Blood. We are called to be a compelling testimony to this generation and to show that Jesus Christ is alive.",
