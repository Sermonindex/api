It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a wonderful way of saying it. A Christian is satisfied. You don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t need wealth, possession or worldly pleasures because Jesus becomes your life. Throughout the Bible Jesus is the God of the living and not of the dead. He has risen from the dead. He is not like the spirits of the dead because He sits at the right hand of God. He is not like gods fashioned from wood. He is alive and not an idol carved from wood or stone. He loves you with eternal love.",
