        "description": "Let\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s look more closely at this. This applies mostly to children, but the parents can listen carefully too. Often the children go off the track and if you look closely, you see the parents haven\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t taught them properly especially those with children a bit older. This applies to young people and to parents who must bring up their children properly. The Bible says \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Teach your children in His way and then they will not deviate from it.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d You parents and mothers, do you hear? Parents complain and say the children don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want to listen but the problem is with the parents. You can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t blame poverty for it. It's usually those that are better off that go wrong. In the world you hear it is poverty that causes the problems. That is not true. If the parents follow the Lord faithfully, the children will follow in their footsteps.",
