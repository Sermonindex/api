        "description": "In the ancient language the fir referred to fire, an ancient symbol for the spirit. The tree also points upwards. Overseas most trees lose their leaves in winter. There are songs about this fir tree in winter and that it is green even in winter. When I first went to Germany to preach I was struck at how brown the trees look, they looked burnt but the fir tree remains evergreen. Evergreens symbolized the everlasting fire in us. We Christians should also always be green. A Christian should always be beautiful. You can read about the beauty of the faith in Gal 5 like love, patience etc. Also go and read the works of the flesh. The fruit of the Holy Spirit in Gal 5:22 speaks of love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, faithfulness, self-control \u00e2\u20ac\u201c these fruit decorate the Christian far more beautifully than the Christmas tree. The Lord said, \"If they do this to me a green branch how much more to those who are dry branches.\" The works of the dry tree are evident: immorality, defilement, witchcraft, enmity, strife, fits of anger, rivalries, divisions, orgies and things like this. Those who do such things will not inherit the kingdom of God. This tree speaks of the attractiveness of the Christian.",
