        "description": "Jim Cymbala gives a very clear and down to earth message on a Scriptural experience that many have confused and brought to extremes in the body of Christ. He clearly shows according to the Bible that the gift of tongues is still for the body of Christ and simply part of the expression of the body of Christ on earth. A very simple yet powerful message that will bless you.",
