        "description": "October 3, 2010 - You might say you started your walk with the Lord with such optimism and all of a sudden you are fighting wars within and wars without. You know the battle is fierce and in and of yourself you have no power to get through your situation. The enemy will roar in your ear with the lie that your circumstance is greater than your God. This message encourages us that if Christ is in us we will never be overpowered by the voice or strategy of the devil. God will take you through before He takes you out. He will give you supernatural strength and your testimony will be Jesus took me through. Never give up because God is on your side!",
