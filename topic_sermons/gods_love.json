Rather all creation \"groans\" under the burden of sin and we are lost because of it. In spite of that, however, God's voice constantly calls us to come to Him -- to rest in the safety of His sheltering arms. Dr. Tozer tells of a God who so loves His creation so much that He offers both love and hope, even though we are hopelessly lost.",
