        "description": "Any work which does not have its genesis in the matrix of God\u2019s rest is nothing short of evil, even a work that appears to be successful, or has a significant numerical impact.  Art Katz points out the bitter irony that Sunday is often the most frenetic of days for God\u2019s children.  Herein lies an exhortation to seriously consider what a work of God really is, and what will truly glorify him.  In order to truly cover the naked, and be Eunuch\u2019s for God, we must operate out of his utter rest.",
