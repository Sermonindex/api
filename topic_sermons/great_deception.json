        "description": "According to multiple biblical passages, the apostasy will be brought about through an intense atmosphere of deception. False teachers from the evangelical movement in the West will play a prominent part in leading multitudes of professing Christians away from a viable walk with God, one step at a time. Much of this process of being led astray will come about because of a smug attitude that they cannot be deceived.",
