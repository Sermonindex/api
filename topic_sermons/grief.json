The scriptures tell us that Jesus is touched with the feelings of our infirmities and is acquainted with all our grief. The Holy Spirit will reach out to you in a unique way. God knows how desperate our situation is. He is saying to you DON'T BE AFRAID, ONLY BELIEVE! We have the Holy Spirit abiding in us to make real all the promises of God and to comfort us in all our afflictions.",
