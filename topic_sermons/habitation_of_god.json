        "description": "For anyone who has ever questioned \"why are we here?\" this is an important and revealing message about the motives and expectations the Lord has of people. The Lord has a very deep desire to have an intimate heart to heart sharing relationship with his children. If you have difficulty praying, or are in a battle of the mind, insecure about the Lord's love for you, you must hear this wonderfully encouraging message. God loves us, and desires fellowship with us.",
