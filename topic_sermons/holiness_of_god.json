Ever since, we have been trying to cover our nakedness and hide our true selves from God, ourselves, and other people. We can never adequately deal with our nakedness, but God has come into our wrecked world to provide a perfect cover for us.",

We major where the Bible minors, and minor where the Bible majors. The shallow and shifting emphases of the pulpit are replete with psychology, sociology, and humanistic philosophy; sermons that feed the ego, play to the emotions, ease the conscience, beguile the unwary, provide for the flesh, foster materialism and worldliness, and smother the fact that we are but \u201cstrangers and pilgrims\u201d in this world. Without holiness no man shall see the Lord. This message sets forth the attribute of HOLINESS in God \u2013 that absolute and immeasurable perfection of His moral nature, which is eternally consistent and allows of no variation; it is an absolute purity of nature that knows no degrees.",
