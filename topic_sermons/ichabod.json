        "description": "Brother Bakht Singh speaks a message on the glory of God departing. Hophni and Phinehas the 2 sons of Eli were doing wickedly before the presence of God. There comes a point when God's people transgress and God withdraws His presence. This is a warning to us in the New Covenant that we are not to test the Lord and not presume His presence with us without following Him in obedience.",
