God chose the lowly things of this world and the despised things\u00e2\u20ac\u201dand the things that are not\u00e2\u20ac\u201dto nullify the things that are, so that no one may boast before Him.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d The question is, are we weak enough for God to call and use us? Are we empty of all the traditions of religious men so that we can learn from the Lord Himself? This is the way of the Lord. God is looking for a Gideon\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s army of those that are willing to trust fully in His power and not in any might or power of their own. God uses nobodies that will trust Him implicitly and fully. Are you going to be part of this Gideon\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s army today?",
