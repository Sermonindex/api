        "description": "God wants his people drawn close to his heart so he can share it with them. He longs to raise us up and carry us to his bosom to reveal his heart to us. Sometimes people are so used to a heavy, hurtful hand, they have a difficult time trusting God. We have to know the power of his gentleness. David said God's gentleness made him great. It is the gentle touch of God that makes us, strengthens us and lifts up our head. Do you experience his grace but respond to others with abusive words? God wants to deliver the hurting and the hurtful.",
