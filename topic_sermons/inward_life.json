My, people thought it was such a wonderful thing\u00e2\u20ac\u201dand they have for 2000 years traveled to Jerusalem.  And when you come there\u00e2\u20ac\u201dI\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve been there twice myself\u00e2\u20ac\u201dyou find nothing like you find here, right in this room.  I tell you the truth, you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t.  You can find in Brooklyn something that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s better than I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve found in Jerusalem.  People talk about\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6  Jesus Christ said, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Neither in Jerusalem nor in this mountain.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d  And yet people travel all over the world to get some entertainment, and God is looking for men and women who will have sense enough to come to Him and do as He says.  He is seeking men and women who worship Him \u00e2\u20ac\u0153in spirit and in truth.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d  And in order to create such men and women, the Lord Jesus Christ has offered us a great and wonderful gift here.  And I would like to impress our hearts tonight with the fact that Jesus Christ has a great blessing: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153If thou knewest the gift of God.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d  Oh, to know that gift of God!",
