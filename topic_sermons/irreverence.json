        "description": "This sermon explores the danger of irreverence towards God in our associations and in ministry. There will always be people among us who desire to go back to \"Egypt.\" To them it is the land flowing with milk and honey. We must avoid their irreverant and profane words. We must avoid them and their influence. That is, we must \"purge ourselves of these\" in order to be pure and useful to God. In fact, Paul references the rebellion of Korah in 2 Timothy 2:19ff. as an example of God's estimate of this type of sin and rebellion.",
