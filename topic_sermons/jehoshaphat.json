        "description": "The Nation of Israel is unique among the kingdoms of the world. No matter what its condition, the nation has been present in one form or another for over 3,000 years. That is because a faithful God has guaranteed their continuance. Our continence as Christians depends on God\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s faithfulness to us as well. David Roper uses one of the greatest battles in Israel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s history to illustrate the point",
