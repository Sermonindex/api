        "description": "In this brief message (7 minutes long) Paul Washer reveals three helps in dealing with Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses, which are useful additions to what he says elsewhere in various other messages. Firstly, Christians believe the Bible even if they cannot explain what the Bible says; they do not alter the texts they cannot explain. Secondly, Christians can testify of times of prayer when the presence and power of God fill the heart almost to bursting; it is not so with the Jehovah\u2019s Witness, for God is not with them. Thirdly, check whether the Jehovah\u2019s Witness\u2019 \u201cgospel\u201d conforms to the Gospel that the Apostle Paul preached, using the above scriptures.",
