        "description": "This is a great revelation of prophetic truth. It is the sublime prophecy of God\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s authority as Judge \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the Judge of all the earth, and the revelation of the supreme royal position of Christ, the Messiah. Daniel was God\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s prophet during the period of Babylonian captivity. The Gentiles thought they were so mighty and powerful. Their despotic rulers and emperors thought they were independent of the God of heaven. The wicked nations thought that their kings had the ultimate and final authority. The kings and the princes of the Gentile world positioned themselves as if they were unpunishable. The prophecy here is a revelation from heaven that God, Who created the earth and all the inhabitants therein, has not abandoned the world to His creatures. This revelation upholds the truth known to patriarchs and prophets from the earliest of times that God is Judge. The God of heaven is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153the Judge of all the earth\u00e2\u20ac\u009d (Genesis 18:25).",

        "description": "A deeply moving wake-up call to the church, instructing her to live in the light of eternity, \"for we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ\" (2 Corinthians 5:10). Leonard Ravenhill describes the judgment day from Scripture as a court day  where the verdict is final. He first points to the judgment of the unjust and then focusses on the judgment of the righteous. He emphasizes that we will all stand before Jesus alone and will not only be judged for what we have done, but also for what we have not done that we should have done. He denounces the worldliness of the people of God who invest their time and money as the world does - thus building on wood, hay and stubble as opposed to silver, gold and precious stones. Leonard Ravenhill strongly opposes today's \"sloppy gospel\" and \"sloppy evangelism\"  of a love with no judgment. He warns that we are passing from the mercy of the lamb to the wrath of the lamb when Jesus judges the earth and mercy will be gone forever. As the work of every human being shall be tried in the fire, many public ministries will go down in ashes. Leonard describes 95 % of believers as bound by superstition and theology. He criticizes the unjust money-making of public ministries that leads to false investments of large amounts of money. He states that we must have Jesus take the government over our lives in reality and be lost and consumed in Him. Ravenhill closes his sermon with a strong call to repentance: \"If we cannot live as a different breed of people on this earth we have no right to live here. God stamp eternity on my eyeballs.\"",
