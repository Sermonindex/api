        "description": "A church filled with all sorts of extra-biblical rules is like a cup that will be clean on the outside, but inside it will be filled with dead men's bones.  Brethren can determine if they are legalists by analyzing whether there is a disparity between their church life, and their private life.  Just like Moses had to hide his face so people could not see God's glory fading, legalists will have to hide parts of their lives from others.  The solution?  The life and the liberty of the Spirit!  The ultimate test of a legalist: \"Do you love rules more than you love people, or do you love people more than you love rules?\"",
