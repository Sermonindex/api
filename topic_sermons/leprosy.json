        "description": "The miraculous catch of fish is God's illustration of soul-winning: it is a mighty miracle of God.  Your responsibility is not to win the lost; your responsibility is just to obey Jesus.  Leprosy is a picture of sin and the cleansing which followed illustrates Jesus' willingness and ability to cleanse sin.  The priestly examination of a cleansed leper signifies that it is not our verbal declaration that confirms our cleansing but others who watch our lives.",
