        "description": "God has mercy on us each and every day. Whether you're a Christian or not, you are here by the grace of God. It is only His mercy that you are still alive. In Acts 5 we read of Ananias and Sapphira who died when they lied to the Holy Spirit. In 1Cor 10:8-11 Paul relates how the children of Israel were judged and killed when they committed fornication, murmured and tempted Christ. And these things happened to them as examples to us, so that we would be admonished not to do the same. If we therefore think of ourselves, the fact that we are still alive is only because of His mercy. God is gracious to you but if you carry on in sin you will be destroyed.",

He shares the old Testament type of what a sacrifice is and how the Lord is calling us in the New Covenant to be a sacrifice for our Lord. He shares many sins and reasons why we do not allow ourselves to be a sacrifice. Brother Edgar can be contacted at: edgarreich@revivalusacanada.org",
