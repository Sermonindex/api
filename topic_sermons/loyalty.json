        "description": "For the leader of a largely volunteer run organization an important question is how to build loyalty with those volunteers. Some steps to be taken are to focus on biblical, holy spirit filled, balanced leadership. It is hard to get people to unite and stay on course. At the same time intellectual honesty and openess must be maintained. Leadership and serventhood must go hand in hand. A good leader seeking to have loyal team members must take time to communicate with people and win their hearts. Verwer emphasizes that loyalty can exist in a balanced, non-cultish form.",
