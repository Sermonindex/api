        "description": "Continuing with his themes he has outlined in Luke, Ed Miller shows how Luke is a gospel that focuses on missions and evangelism, for Jesus truly came for all. It has also been referred to as the \"happiest gospel\", for there is much on joy and thanksgiving. Furthermore, Luke writes simply, with many stories of contrast and finally, he is the author that mentions the Holy Spirit the most and of how Jesus as man lived completely in the power of the Holy Spirit. Both parts of this introduction will certainly wet the appetite to study and drink in this unique gospel.",
