        "description": "March 14, 2004 - What a wonderful thing when God touches a man a puts a call on our lives. When we walk in obedience all the demons of hell can\u2019t stand against us. A fire will burn in us to walk out our calling. God allows twisted situations in our lives of being hurt and misunderstood and we must prevail against our enemies through the faithfulness of Jesus. God understands our pain and He will instill us a faith in that fire that can\u2019t be shaken. Preaching from the book of Jeremiah, Wilkerson preaches on a popular passage of Scripture.  Wilkerson puts out a Watchman\u2019s call, giving us that unction to preach the gospel with the proper zeal, understanding the calling of God.",
