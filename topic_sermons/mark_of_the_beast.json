This is a time of unprecedented temptation, and the pull of the world is strong. God wants to draw his own back to intimacy with him, but they are for the most part full and satisfied.",

Those who will be deceived into taking the mark of the beast will be unsatisfied with the things of God, and develop a false value system. As a result they will bring to God less than He requires of them. But those who choose to live for the will of God are promised His peace and strength. God will take us into His protective hand and nothing will harm us. God knows those who are His and we are sealed in the almighty hands of God.",
