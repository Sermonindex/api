He gives also a strong point on the responsibility of the minister, 'you show me a carnal pastor I will show you a carnal church'. So it is of paramount importance that the leaders be real with God and be spiritual. He says the only way to have a real spiritual stamina with God its through the 'morning watch' spending time with God daily.",
