        "description": "The names of God are actually parts of his divine nature, revealed to his children in their times of crisis. When Israel came to the Wilderness of Shur 3 days after crossing the Red Sea, they were thirsty, having used up their water, and immediately began to complain. God supplied the water, but Moses named the place \"Marah\" meaning bitterness. There are those of God's people who have been hurt and have the root of bitterness in them and God wants to lovingly deal with and remove it lest they be defiled by it. The Lord who heals can mend your broken heart. Part 2 of 8",
