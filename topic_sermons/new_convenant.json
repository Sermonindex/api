        "description": "Zac teaches three fundamental truths about the new covenant as it is explained in Hebrews 8.  The new covenant begins with an assurance that our sins have been cleansed away, not just covered, coupled with a warning about the sin of unforgiveness.  Secondly, we can know Him personally as our Father, in living connection with Him all the day, both speaking and listening.  And finally, God writes upon the two tablets--the mind and the heart--to not only be willing but the grace as God's power to do it.",
