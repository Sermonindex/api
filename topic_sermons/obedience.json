We are all resistant to change especially when it involves what we perceive to be hardship or loss to ourselves or someone we love. There is nothing in us that wants to gravitate toward difficulty. In the western world we have formed a Christian theological perspective that avoids difficulty, which results in an anemic Christianity. When we get a word from the Lord that sometimes doesn't make sense to the natural mind, we must be careful to who and what we listen to. There are well meaning people all along our journey that will unknowingly try to break your heart of obedience. God call us to a radical obedience where we will go where you lead us no matter what the cost! When we learn to walk in the ways of God and follow the voice of God the miraculous is released in our lives. Are you willing to respond to the Lord with, \u201chere I am Lord, send me\u201d?",

        "description": "Before the revival I was troubled, for I would go around holding services and many would repent. But after 2 or 3 years when I return to visit them again I would find the Christians in disunity. But we read in Acts how the early Christians were of one heart and soul (Acts 4:32). But what I found among the Christians were in opposition to this, the one would criticize the next; the other would complain that they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re not treated well or greeted properly. I knew that revival wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t start if things didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t come right among the Christians first, for the Bible says that judgment must begin in the house of God (1Pet 4:17). The reason the Word of God, the Bible, doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t cover the earth, is not because of the heathen, but because of the Christians that aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t living according to the Word of God. Jesus said that the one who believes in Him as the Scripture has said, from his innermost being will flow rivers of Living Waters. Rivers of water cannot be stopped. You might try to stop a river by building a restraining wall in the river, but the water will only build up on the one side and eventually break the wall in a massive flood, or the water will rise up and flow over the wall.",

James continue to say that unless you continue to show by your life that you have the true faith, your faith is worthless. Faith is directional in a Person. Faith not only requires that something is held true, but that Someone has entered into your life. Grasp this secret or you've missed the crux of the matter. Faith is not believing a set of historical facts. All the historical facts about Jesus, that He was the perfect spotless Lamb of God, born of a virgin, died for our sins, was buried and rose again the third day - all of this the demons know to be true, but it doesn't help them. You need a special agreement with Jesus Christ, and then confess that commitment before people publicly. You must believe with the heart unto righteousness and confess with your mouth unto salvation (Rom 10:10).",

After the captivity in Babylon, many of Israel had grown comfortable and stayed, rather than returning. Mixture in the world gives the enemy room to rise up and rule over you. Esther fasted and prayed, but she then had to get up and go to the king. We, as the Body of Christ, need to remember we are ambassadors of Christ, and there is no time for games. Jesus is coming, and we need to come out from among the world, and seperate ourselves for his purposes. If you are struggling with your flesh, this message will help you, and hopefully motivate you. Esther risked her life to intercede for her people. We need to risk whatever will come into our lives whether persecution, or trouble, to be seperated to God's purposes.",

At some point we have to realize that the same God who created the universe lives inside of us and will enable us to accomplish all that He's called us to do. There comes a time when God doesn't have to speak anymore because you already know what He wants you to do. God says put away the old man and put away the old nature. He is seeking for a man after His own heart who would simply walk in obedience with Him. Are you embracing something that God has clearly told you to put away? The word of the Lord to you today is obey God! Obedience is the beginning of the journey of dancing.",
