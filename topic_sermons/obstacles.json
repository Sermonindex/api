        "description": "Pastor Conlon begins in Matthew 21:19-22 on faith, and overcoming obstacles that hinder our victory. God wants us to come to him for the Holy Ghost as a people that will not be denied, that will rise up in faith and lay hold on the promises God has made, and appropriate and apply the spiritual authority given to us by Jesus. Pastor Conlon goes on to Mark 9:17-30. The casual seeker of God will never know the power of being able to walk in the spirit as Jesus did and be a vessel God can channel his power through to deliver those oppressed and bound by the enemy. A Message of obtainable victory. Must hear.",
