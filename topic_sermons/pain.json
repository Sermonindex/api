When we are in spiritual, mental and physical pain and you have never endured more than your going through now, God will come with the comfort of the Holy Spirit and lead you to His word and His promises and He will reveal Himself through His word. The Devil will tell you God has passed you by \u00c2\u2013 But you will hear a voice behind you say I will never leave you or forsake you.",
