        "description": "Paul Washer explains what an assembly should look for when seeking a pastor. Apostasy is so widespread that a pastor must be in total submission to Biblical truth. False prophets come in several forms, and apostasy is manifest in a variety of ways, so the pastor must hold and teach sound doctrine. But remember that doctrine is the means, not the end. The end is that the life of Jesus Christ is lived out in each one of his people (48 minutes).",

        "description": "Paul Washer is explaining what an assembly should look for in a Godly pastor. Will the man point things out that need dealing with? Is he a servant of Jesus Christ, as well as of the sheep? What is his relationship with the word of God for himself ? Is his teaching balanced, not just majoring on his favourite topics? Does he work hard? How does he discipline himself for the purpose of Godliness? Don\u2019t be persuaded just by a pleasant personality, Mr Washer warns. (29 minutes)",
