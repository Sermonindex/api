        "description": "In this lesson, we continue our study of Satan's lies and God's truths concerning three basic areas: authority, rebellion and patriotism. Satan has fostered basic lies in each of these three areas, but we want to take a look at what it means to be under authority, and we will also take a test to find out about our rebellion quotient. Finally, we will take a brief look at what our duty is concerning our country.",
