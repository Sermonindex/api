Today some churches still have the tradition to hold this type of feast where the people bring thanksgiving gifts to God. A little boy was present at one of these offerings, and when the others brought their thanksgiving gifts, he realised that he had nothing to give to Jesus. Suddenly he got a bright idea, rushed to the front and got into the gifts basket, saying, \"Lord Jesus, I haven't got anything; but I give myself to you\". This is a sermon to each one of us.",

When the Holy Spirit consumes our heart we will have a compassion that causes us to look away from self and look to the needs of others. When the Holy Spirit comes down a dedication comes to the House of God there is corporate worship and wholehearted fellowship with other believers. We will be totally abandoned to God and fellow man. Ask for the Holy Spirit to give you the testimony of Jesus Christ to be alive in your heart so Pentecost can move outside the church.",

We are told that they will come from the east and west and sit together with Abraham, Isaac and Jacob at the tables of heaven (Matt 8:11-12). But what is shocking is that that passage goes on to say that the children of the Kingdom will be cast out! Every child of God should test and examine himself that he is not counted with those who are cast out of the Kingdom of Heaven. Abraham was 75 years old when God gave him a promise and told him to leave the land of his forefathers. And he left everything (Gen 12:1-4). We can learn so much from him. If we want to follow Jesus, we must also leave everything behind. But his father Terah wanted to go with him. He respected his father and allowed him to go with him. He was promised that although he was 75 years old and had no children, his offspring will be as the stars of heaven (Gen 15:5, 22:17, 26:4, 12:7). Abraham also took Lot along as a nephew and son, since he had no children of his own. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s so easy to make a mistake. Lot was a very nice person and it was difficult for Abraham to refuse. They traveled as far as Haran and settled there (Gen 11:31). God stopped speaking to Abraham until his father passed away. When his father had died, then God spoke again to him to continue (Gen 11:32 - 12:1). When God calls you, don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t take anything along except what God says you should take along.",
