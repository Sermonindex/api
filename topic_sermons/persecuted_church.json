        "description": "Pastor Wurmbrand shares his experiences in jail for 14 years by the communists. He shares a specific facet of his testimony which was the nothingness they were faced with in jail. No bibles, No fellowship, No communion, No sound. But admist this all the Lord Jesus Christ revealed himself to the prisoners and allowed them to experience him and even take communion. This message will stir you out of apathy and grumbling over our little issues in life that are nothing in comparision with what this brother went through. May this message show us the needs to pray and support the persecuted church. \"It is a shame to be a luke-warm Christian\".",

        "description": "Brother David shares a stirring message on the current persecution of the Church of Jesus Christ. He clearly shows from Scripture there will be a world-wide persecution of Christians in the end-times. That this world-wide persecution will be one of the great signs of the soon coming of the Lord Jesus Christ. He shares even for America that persecution is increasing and potentially coming very soon.",
