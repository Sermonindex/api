        "description": "The last words of Christ in the temple were the divine portrait of religious hypocrisy.  Jesus Christ's accusation is against the heart, not the outward appearance, which may appear very moral and upright.  John Rhys Watkins lifts up the truth of Christ as a mirror to check ourselves, lest we fall under the same condemnation.",
