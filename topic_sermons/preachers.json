        "description": "Erlo Stegen speaks a powerful word on failure in preachers and calling ministers to be lights in the evil dark world. Why is it so dark in the world? Because many stars have fallen, the preachers of the Gospel have fallen. Ministers and preachers are being caught in evil things. It is getting dark in the world. It seems as if the sun is indeed going down. It seems as if we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re coming to the end of the world and the end of time. We read that in the last days it will indeed go difficult, and that the powers of heaven will be shaken (Matt 24:29).",
