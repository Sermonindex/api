We are in a great need to covet, desire of God's presence with us and to repent of our sins and lack of desire to have God involved with us as we endeavour to be in His work. 'Working for God without God' is one of the great tragedies of the modern church in North America.",

We don't know the journey God is taking us but he does. God will test and prove his people along this journey as he did Israel in the wilderness to see if we will believe and obey him. He wants us not living on bread (prosperity) promises alone, but by every promise in the Word of God. To not fully trust God is to strip him of all he wants to be and can be to us and bring him down to the level of a dead idol. It's a grievous sin in God's eyes to have unbelief, and the church needs to realize it.",

And they will reap wonderful rewards of joy and peace in their God. We need to actively seek God, wanting his ways and thoughts over our own to become so intimate with him that we know his heart and share it. Then we will love what he loves and hate what he hates. Thinking as he things, walking together in agreement. This is what God wants with each of his children. For those who want a closer walk with the Lord, this is a must hear.",

These are Christians who focus on material provision for the satisfying of their own desires. They are masters of their own destiny, choosing their own course, thus becoming their own god. Embracing the truth is about eternity and when we don't embrace truth we become imposters in the house of God. The imposter will create his own covering and create his own righteousness. The Holy Spirit is calling His church out of the sin of compromise and to come under the covering of the blood of Jesus. God is calling you out today to cover you and to take away your shame.
