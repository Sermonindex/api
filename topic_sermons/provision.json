The question is what are we asking for? We are called to be a testimony of Jesus Christ in the earth. The light and life of Christ is given to those who are given for the purposes of God. Ask for your heart to be broken for the lost. Ask for the strength to take up your cross and follow Jesus. We are to seek first His kingdom. Seek the heart and the will of God and He promises that all we need will be given to us and at the end of the day we will have joy!",

Many turn back right at the place where they will begin to discover and enter into the supernatural life of God. When we are in unbelief we begin to limit God by doubting that He could supply what we need and take us where He is calling us to go. The central core of unbelief is that God's way is incomplete and we must help Him bring His plan to pass. If you are sitting in unbelief, remove yourself from that place and grab on to the promises of God. We must learn how to trust God for strength and provision. Don't pray to get out of the situation, pray that you may find supernatural life in it. God is looking for people who have come through the wilderness with a voice of triumph to speak to the next generation. Do you believe that God CAN, or will you limit the Holy One of Israel?",

Mr Moses Khoza also gave His testimony of how he had strayed from God, but God has shown him grace, granted him forgiveness of sin and even touched him physically. Before he came to KwaSizabantu he was in hospital and had a terrible experience. The people in his ward were very sick. One night he went to fetch himself some water to drink. When he came back to his bed, one of the patients begged him for some water. When he had fetched the water, the man didn't want to drink it, but asked mr Khoza to pour it onto his neck and chest, for he felt like he was burning. After that the next patient had the same request and then the next. It carried on for quite a while. The next morning two of the patients had passed away. God spoke to him through the incident, and he came to KwaSizabantu and met with the Lord afresh.",

We are called to go into the world and pick up what nobody wants and tell the world there is bread enough for all and this bread is Jesus Christ Himself.
