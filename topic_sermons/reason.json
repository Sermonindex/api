        "description": "Reason, says A. W. Tozer, is the wise recognition of things as they really are. Though Christians are accused of letting their imaginations run away with them, we actually deal in reality because of our insistence in stripping everything down to the hard core. We want to know all the facts about God, ourselves and our relationship with the Creator. What about sin? What about judgment? What about Heaven and hell? Dr. Tozer says that no other philosophy on earth deals with all the facts of life, death and God \u2013 only Christianity. It is the believer\u2019s voice of reason.",
