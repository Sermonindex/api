        "description": "January 11, 2009 - How many sermons do we need to hear before we simply take God at His Word? There comes a time that we can become gospel hardened because we don\u2019t allow our heart to respond in faith to the Word of God. We are called to be living epistles read and known to all men. Now is the time to allow our lives to be an example of the faithfulness of God. It is time to let our family and those around us take notice because we have an unwavering faith in Jesus Christ. You may be the only Bible your neighbors will ever read.",

        "description": "Preached at a Ministerial Enrichment Conference  in 1984. Bro. Wilkerson uses many scriptures in this sobering, yet very accurate message on the lack of prayer in the church. Many will fight for prayer in their schools, yet do not pray at home. Hard times are coming before the Lord comes for his people, and those who do not pray won't be ready or able to face it. People are too busy to pray, they praise the Lord but don't pray to him. He is a stranger among them in his own house. Convicting!!!!",

What a sobering judgement given showing Ravenhill's steadfast heart to the seriousness of preaching the gospel and desiring after revival. Ravenhill is 85 years old in this recording.",
