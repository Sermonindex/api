        "description": "Zac Poonen shares during a time of recession that God is allowing this to test and see if we are serving mammon as a God. Why should it disturb us if Mammon is shaking? We should be content that the kingdom of God principles are the same in our day. Brother Zac talks about a Babylonian church system that does not serve Christ. A very important message in our times.",
