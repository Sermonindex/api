        "description": "Making the decision to follow after Christ is a daily thing, not saying a prayer one time and that is it; it is much more than that. Nothing is easy, we need to choose to do whatever it takes for the sake of reaching the lost. You as a follower of Christ, you cannot have an intimate relationship with the Creator if you have a self-centered life that only revolves around you.",
