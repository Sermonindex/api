        "description": "When the Holy Spirit convicts you of something needing changing, and guilt and condemnation set in, and aware of your own struggle, you fear the Lord is tired of your failures and has rejected you. Because of past wounds in their lives, some fear God will reject them as people sometimes have. You can determine to live a new life in Christ, secure and have the assurance you so desperately need. When the Word comes and voices arise to condemn you, you can shoot them down (Is. 54:17). God loves you enough to not let you by with sin that will destroy you. Come to him for cleansing, forgiveness, and peace and rest.",
