        "description": "This is a message about how the visual Christian today has made a mockery out of God and how in turn God has made us a reproach among the heathens.  The text begins in Ezekiel 36:21.  But in the end God will bring those that do these things down and God will sanctify (honor) His great name.",

        "description": "This message is very much for those who may feel that the \"enemy\" is attacking them on all sides. It especially deals with those who are walking about as though \"crushed\" by the enemy because of past hurts, etc.. It also deals with those who have had to leave certain churches because of false teaching. We need to stop blaming and focusing on the false, (though it is OK to recognize the problem) and instead focus on Christ and His faithfulness. He will see us through.",

        "description": "March 11, 2007 - This message is for Christians that have positioned themselves in the center of two different kingdoms. The Kingdom of God and the kingdom of the world, Coming to the house of the Lord with a seemingly holy devotion for God and leaving the House of the Lord and having the same devotion for the things of the world. This is the reason why there is such a powerless testimony and the church is becoming a non issue in this society. We cannot be devoted to the Lord and be devoted to the things that offend His holy name. God is calling His church to come outside the camp and come out of mixture and compromise to serve the Lord wholeheartedly. In every generation there has to be somebody that is willing to stand in the middle of the marketplace and bear the reproach of Jesus Christ.",
