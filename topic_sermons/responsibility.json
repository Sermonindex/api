As we seek to answer these questions, we will also look at what it means to be held personally accountable. We will look at examples from the lives of Joseph, Paul, and Job as to what our response should be when difficult circumstances arrive. We will learn God's truth about responsibility.",

We must recognize that the testimony of Jesus Christ has little strength and consider that the beginning of a spiritual awakening is when we in humility admit our condition. In this moment of time we are given a choice, Jesus has set before us an open door. Do we stay in our smallness or do we get up in faith and walk through the open door into the victory of the Cross? As God\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s people we have a responsibility to get up and believe God for the power to find the full purpose that He has for our life.",
