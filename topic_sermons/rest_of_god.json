        "description": "April 10,2005 - The man who is getting close to God becomes increasingly aware of the depth of his failings. God looks to the man who has a broken spirit and a contrite heart, the man who knows he has no resources apart from God. The man who comes to God with the little he has and offers it to Him will be used by God to do the miraculous . It is in this Heart that God can rest.",

        "description": "This sermon speaks of how God sends leanness into the lives of Christians when they won\u2019t rest in what his direction is for their lives.  Carter illustrates, through various scriptures, how Christians find themselves in dry places because they are not content in the station that God has put them in.  An illustration that Carter used was the complaining that the children went through in the wilderness when they weren\u2019t content with the manna. The scripture that this sermon was built around was Psalm 106:15  And he gave them their request; but sent leanness into their soul.",
