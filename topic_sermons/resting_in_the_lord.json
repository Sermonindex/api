        "description": "Pastor Bill Ammon gives us the exhortation to rest in the Lord and wait patiently for Him. Many times in our lives we are striving in our own energies trying to help God out when God wants us to just rest and see His work done. May we find grace to rest in the Lord in our lives, this secret of the Christian life.",
