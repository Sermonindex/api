Your joy and your peace are in ever knowing and receiving him, learning of him, even if the flesh doesn't like it. You are loving the appearing of Christ. He appears to you in his Word, through his Word, and as you behold him, you will become more like him. But the time is here when many do not and will not love the truth.",

The future of the true church of Jesus Christ will have a heavenly vision. Who then is the faithful and wise servant? The servant who is one in heart and one with the purposes of God. The wise servant will have their hands stretched out to heal and touch those around them with the supernatural power that can come only by God's Spirit. Those that will have spiritual sight in the last days will have a willingness to be sent by God as a vessel to be poured out and broken for lost humanity.",
