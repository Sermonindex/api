Yohannan challenges us with this question: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153What does it mean to be like Jesus?\u00e2\u20ac\u009d How many of us will actually take time and intercede for the nations? Weep over the unreached world and seek to do something to help aide in the Gospel being preached? How many of us will take a day or two and fast and pray for the lost? Like the scriptures say, we are to come and follow Jesus, live like Him and what He lived for.",
