        "description": "In order to walk in victory over self-centeredness, we must reckon this flesh to have been crucified with Christ on the cross.  If we are living with the sole purpose of chasing after worldly things like food, clothing, a good comfortable life, popularity or advancement, we have not accepted that Jesus died for these things. Brother Zac points out in this sermon how salvation is completely free, but there are things in Christianity that will cost us.  Can you be so lost in ministry that you lose a meal? Suffer persecution?  While emphasizing that we must be victorious in these areas we are encouraged to accept the concept of steady progress over these sins as is shown to be a thematic of New Covenant faith.",
