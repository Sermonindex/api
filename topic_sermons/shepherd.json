        "description": "September 28, 2008 - There is a great revelation of God coming to this generation. This revelation will not be given to the self indulgent and the self seeking. It will be given to the humble person who desires to live their life for the betterment of others. God will come in the midst of darkness and reveal Himself to the shepherds who are simply looking after their flock. Suddenly the heavens will be opened and by the grace of God we will begin to reach out to those who are hungry and hurting. Suddenly our ears will be opened to the worship of Heaven and we will sing a song of trust and confidence in God. A song that says, \"Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace and good will towards men.\" Our song is a living expression of trust in God.",
