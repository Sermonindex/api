        "description": "Jude reminds us of the judgement on Sodom and Gomorrah that were destroyed to such a degree that it is believed that the cities used to be built upon the land where the Dead Sea, the lowest point on the earth, now is.  The sin of Sodom was the condoning of such widespread and abominable sin within the cities gates, which was not only homosexuality.  Back in Genesis, Abraham had interceeded for the cities and the Lord had been merciful but the only people to be delivered from the cities was Lot and his family although hid wife of course did not survive due to her emotional ties to the cities.  It is interesting that Jude mentions this incident in a letter about apostacy as this means that Sodom knew the truth and turned from it, becuase the truth is revealed to all of through creation itself.  So these apostates act as they want, deny authority and speak evil of dignities.",

        "description": "Sodom and Gomorrah and their neighbouring cities were exceedingly sinful before the Lord. They declared their sins openly. Violence was rampant, and their sexual perversions were not hidden. Their sin reached unto heaven and God could no longer keep silent. God decided to destroy them, but he was looking for someone to turn away His fierce wrath from them. Our society today has surpassed Sodom and Gomorrah in sin. God's judgement is surely coming, even as Billy Graham once said that, \"if God does not judge America, He will have to apologise to Sodom and Gomorrah.\" Lot lived amongst them, but was no testimony. His only concern was for his own safety. He wanted to be saved, and considered the others beyond hope. Many Christians today live similar lives. They consider the homosexuals, rapists and murderers beyond salvation. They pray God's judgement upon them, and not for their salvation.",
