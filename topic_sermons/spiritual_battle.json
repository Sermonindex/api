        "description": "In the world people are fighting against flesh and blood, one race against another race, one nation against another nation. But we do not fight against flesh and blood but rather against principalities and rulers of the darkness of this age. The Word tells us, finally, be strong in the Lord and in the power of His might. The power of the Lord Jesus is great. However, the devil and demons have power too but limited. But God's power is the greatest, and He has commanded us to go into all the world and make disciples of all nations and teach them to keep all that He has commanded us (Matt 28:19-20). You do not get salvation through education. Education without Christ just produces clever devils. Jesus commanded us to teach the nations, not just to know, but to keep all that He has taught us.",
