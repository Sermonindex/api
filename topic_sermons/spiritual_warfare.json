Satan will seek to draw us away from loving and obeying God, from prayer, and from our position of faith.  To do so will result in failure.  But we must stand strong in the Lord and believe Christ for the victory.",

        "description": "October 14, 2007 - Whenever the people of God move away from living in a manner that brings glory to His Name, they will find themselves positioned on the wrong side of the battle. What do you do when you find yourself charting your own course because you refused to trust in God's promises? God says if you belong to Him, He will get you out! Suddenly all your new plans, new friends, new truths, new opinions that you formed in the flesh will leave you standing all ALONE on the wrong side of the battle and something will rise up in your heart that says get me out of here! God is calling His church to rise up and go after everything that the enemy has taken from us until we recover all.",

        "description": "It is a prevalent fact that many believers are completely ignorant of how we are at war.  There is a spiritual war waging around us at all times and many of us need to engage in this battle.  The problem is that we first have to win the battle within.  We have to allow grace to have its perfect work in our lives, we have to believe that God loves our souls and sent his son to die for them.  Ron Reed discusses how too many people view Christianity as a passive experience, and points out how the Devil will devour and pick off stragglers very easily when they fail to engage in the Spiritual warfare against their own inner voice or soul.  A strong exhortation is given to actively engage in a devotional life with God that encompasses meditation on the word and prayer.  He also discussed how one of the principle weapons the enemy uses against us is speculation.",
