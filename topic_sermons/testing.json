        "description": "God wanted to see what was in the heart of Hezekiah. The rulers of Babylon sent their envoys to him, to come and see and hear for themselves what God was busy doing in the land. But when they came, God left Hezekiah. Previously when the king of Assyria came to besiege Jerusalem, Hezekiah went to the prophet Isaiah, and God sent His angel to kill 185,000 from the Assyrian army, and delivered Jerusalem (2Kings 19). His second test was that of his illness. After he had witnessed God\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s miraculous intervention in saving him from the Assyrians he became ill. God sent the prophet Isaiah to him to say that he had to prepare his house for he will die. But he turned his face to the wall and pleaded with God. God saw his tears and heard his prayer and added 15 years to his life (Isaiah 38; 2Kings 20).",
