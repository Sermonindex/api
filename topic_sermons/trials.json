Jesus allows us to go through various trials and He delays His coming when a situation is not impossible enough to the intent and purpose that He can produce an unwavering faith in our heart. He allows the hopeless situation to become an impsosible situation so that there is nothing humanly possible for you to do. When we walk away from Jesus in unbelief without considering His faithfulness Jesus is wounded by our unbelif and doubt.",

        "description": "June 28, 2009 - Today many Christians are suffering with various afflictions and trials. In these seasons we have a tendency to question God's faithfulness and doubt that He will answer our prayers. When our problems go from bad to worse and the answer doesn\u2019t seem to come, there is a bitterness that begins to rise up. We can do one of two things. We can either turn to the Lord and trust in His Word or charge God with \"Fatherly negligence\". God knows and cares! We have a heavenly Father who knows about agony so much so that He allowed His own Son to die on a cross and suffer so that we may be comforted in all our afflictions. God Knows and God Cares!",

But when Paul, and the prisoners were on the boat, bound for Rome, the storm tore the boat to pieces, and it went down. Paul had a word of hope from the Lord. All hell watched as God exposed every tool of the enemy, by sending them against Paul in this circumstance and his servant overcome. He kept him, and strengthened him. A wonderful message of encouragement for anyone in a hard trial. God prepares his people before the storm hits. And he takes them through it.",
