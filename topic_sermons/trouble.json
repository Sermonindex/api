He's continually watching over his own, willing to speak to us and guide us. THe Bible tells us that Christ himself is in us, and we are in him. We have been given great and precious promises that we might partake of his divine nature (2 Pet. 1:4). In trouble, God is there, and in peaceful times, God is there. What comfort in these perilous times! An uplfting message for those in trials and tribulation.",
