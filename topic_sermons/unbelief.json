The grief of God's heart is caused by those who are closest to Him and yet still have a heart full of unbelief. Wherever there is unbelief there is hopelessness and a wilderness. God promises that He will BE GOD TO US, we must trust Him and take Him at His word. God wants a simple determined faith that believes and takes hold of His promises.",

This message makes a bold statement that there is no suffering, calamity, tragedy or even death of a loved one that can excuse distrusting the faithfulness of God. There is no suffering that justifies unbelief. Jesus Christ came as a full revelation of all the provision He made to have faith to endure every circumstance. In this day of grace, God will not and cannot wink at unbelief. We as Christians have been given a full revelation of the power of Jesus Christ through the indwelling of the Holy Spirit. God says He will not listen to the language of unbelief since He has given us all knowledge, wisdom and promises to become a partaker of His very nature.",
