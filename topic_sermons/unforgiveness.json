        "description": "January 28, 2007 - The human heart has the ability to take something evil and refashion it in our thinking and call it good. The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom and this wisdom is understanding that God means what God says. We can not alter His standard. The Bible clearly says if we forgive each other He will forgive us, but if we will not forgive others neither will He forgive us. Many of us will never grow in Grace because we are not willing to forgive those who have wounded us. Forgiveness is not an option it is a commandment from God. Jesus Christ has provided everything we need to forgive.",
