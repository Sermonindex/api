But the Bible says, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We are saved by hope.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d   And that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the thing that gives me great joy: to know that the work we do here, we don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t do for a few years only, or for some glory\u00e2\u20ac\u201dfor some crown upon this earth, or recommendation by men.

That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the thing we have been working for, praise God!  And 32 years is really a very, very short time when you think that the seed we sow is going to result in a harvest that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s going to go on forever and forever to the glory of God.  And how very, very important it is that we get the sight of it\u00e2\u20ac\u201dthat we get the light of it.",

If we desire to hear God's voice we have to hear the whole package, the provision of God and the cry of God for the helplessness of humanity. We must offer all that we are so that God's heart would be satisfied in the earth. If you are willing to be given for others you will know and hear the voice of Jesus.
