        "description": "February 13, 2005 - We must come to an understanding that God is faithful. We don\u2019t give to God for what we can get from Him, nor do we give when it is burdensome. We are to offer ourselves willingly as God gives us the release to do so. We must have a balanced understanding to what it means to give to the work of God.",
