Paul Washer exposes the corruptions of our modern culture as he explains, from Biblical principles, how a man should treat a woman; the qualities he should look for in a potential wife; how he should prepare himself for the responsibilities of marriage and parenthood; and the principles of courtship. He ends with helpful admonitions regarding sexual immorality  (71 minutes).",
