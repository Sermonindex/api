        "description": "What were the first words God spoke after His silence of 400 years? Zacharias the priest was the first to hear the Word of the Lord, yet despite his righteousness, he chose to be in unbelief. Ed Miller begins his study in Chapter 1 with contrasting Zacharias' unbelief with Mary's faith. With gentleness, he reminds all believers how easily we can fall into unbelief regardless of how close we walk with Him.",
